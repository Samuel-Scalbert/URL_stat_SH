Who am I?

● Professor / researcher at Université Côte d’Azur, in the South of France

○ Member of the WIMMICS research group common to INRIA and I3S lab from CNRS
○ W3C Advisory Committee Representative for UCA

● I participate to W3C working groups (HTML5, WebAudio…)
● I’m the co-creator of the 

Web Audio Modules 2.0 (WAM or WAM2), 
aka VSTs for the Web.

● Some WebAudio plugins I wrote are

now commercialized by CNRS (tube guitar
amplifier simulators + audio FXs)

Before 1996
we barely could hear 
any sound from a browser

Created in 1993, last updated:1996, HTML 1

After 1996
Horrors and Joys

The infamous <bgsound> tag from IE4! (1996)

…also known as the 
worst possible way 
to use audio on the 
web!

However, with a little struggle, we had great 
applications!

FXExperiencePlayer / Java FX (video from 2012)

Audiotools / Flash(video from 2013)

1996-2011

2008-2010: HTML5 audio tag with 
rather complete JavaScript API

ANOTHER CODEC WAR, until 2015 
no way to play a mp3 on all major 
browsers!

For serious audio applications: Flash or Die!

Soundation

Audio Sauna

2010
First browser APIs 
for audio processing

Firefox Audio Data API (2010)

Simple: nearly no native code in the browser, all sound processing delegated to JavaScript, short spec!

The Web Audio API (2010)

Proposed by Chris Rogers (ex Apple Core Audio Engineer) and his team at Google

Audio Graph concept with nodes’ DSP part 
coded natively in the browser…

The Web Audio API (2010)

Answer by Mozilla…

Google was Google…. 
impressive demos, etc.

Creation of a W3C Web 
Audio Working Group

Meeting every 1-2 weeks

In person meeting 2-3 times a year

(right picture from 2021)

Some milestones

15/12/2011: first draft specification of the 
WebAudio API

● Lot of work to make sure it can be 

implemented and sound the same on all 
browsers (algorithms, etc.)

2012: 

● Implementations in Firefox/Webkit browsers
● Support for real time input: Media Capture and 

Streams API

● First draft of the WebMidi API, implementation 

in Google Chrome

○

(2022 in Firefox too!)

But… porting 
existing DSP code 
was not easy…

The WebAudio API was 
incomplete!

Need for something better!

Some milestones

2018-2022: AudioWorklet : custom DSP processing in the Audio Thread

2012 : WebSockets (synchronous collaboration)

2015: Web Components

2018: WebAssembly

Recent history…

2021: the WebAudio API V 1.0 became 
a W3C Recommendation in June 2021 
(aka a “frozen standard”)

2021-today : ongoing development of 
Version 2.0

● The working group took care of 

github issues/proposals

● Conducted a developers’ survey

2022 : W3C proposes help for higher 
level standards (i.e for a plugin standard)

Some notable demos

2011-2015: Chris Wilson’s demos!

2014: first implementation of ToneJS library

Used in TONS of 
projects!

2015: Web Audio debugger in Firefox

2015: Web Audio 
Modules (Kleimola & 
Larkin)

2015: first commercial DAWS

Soundtrap.com (spotify)

Bandlab.com

Ampedstudio.com

Soundation.com

2016: why not some guitar?

2014/2015: DSLs compile to ASM.js and later to 
WebAssembly

FAUST, PureData, 
Csound, others can be 
run on the Web

2018 : FAUST online IDE

2018: Ableton comes in the game!

2018: the live coding 
community shines

Strudel (Roos, Mclean),  Gibber, ( Roberts and 
Joann), Estuary (Ogborn and Beverley), Hydra, 
Wags, Feedforward, etc.

Strudel in 2022

Some projects started in 2012…

2022: Web Audio plugins become mature (WAM)

2022: Roland comes in the game!

2022: Microtonal synthesizer (Khyam Allami / counterpoint)

LEIMMA: explore microtonial tuning 
systems

APOTOME: generative music 
composition tool, which lets you use 
all the tunings from LEIMMA

2022: Audacity (the real one) on the Web thanks to WASM

Port of audacity on the Web!

● WASM compiled

Also: WASM port of transitionDJ 
app

CONCLUSION

The Web platform is Magic :-)

Web Audio is a technology but it also became a new, multidisciplinary, research field

Web Audio lives along with all other APIs, and goes beyond the browser now…

WebML, WebCodecs,WebAudio API standalone in embedded systems, etc.
