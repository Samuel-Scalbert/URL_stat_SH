Abstract

A powerful automatic detection of estrus, the only period
when the cow is susceptible to pregnancy, is a key driver
to help farmers with reproduction management and subse-
quently to improve milk production resource use in dairy
farms. Automatic solutions to detect both types of estrus (be-
havioral and silent estrus) based on the combination of af-
fordable phenotyping data (activity, body temperature) exist,
but they do not provide faithful explanations to support their
alerts and in ways that farmers can understand based on the
behaviors they could observe in animals. In this paper, we first
propose XPM, a novel pattern-based classifier to detect both
types of estrus with real-world affordable sensor data (ac-
tivity, body temperature) which supports its predictions with
perfectly faithful explanations. Then, we show that our ap-
proach performs better than a commercial reference in estrus
detection, driven by the detection of silent estrus. Finally, we
present the explainability of our solution which stems from
the communication to the farmers the presence and/or ab-
sence of a limited number of patterns determinant of estrus
detection, therefore reducing solution mistrust and support-
ing farmers’ decision-making.

Introduction

Improve resource use in dairy farms is one of the most im-
portant steps towards meeting both food production and en-
vironmental goals (Searchinger et al. 2018). The detection of
determining events for milk production like estrus, the only
period when the cow is susceptible to become pregnant, is
crucial for an optimal resource use. Reproduction issue is the
most prevalent reason for cow culling (Bascom and Young
1998), and reproduction performance directly impacts milk
production (Inchaisri et al. 2010).

Traditionally, estruses are detected visually by observing
cow behaviors as cows significantly increase their activity
during estrus (Silper et al. 2015; Gaillard et al. 2016). How-
ever, the visual detection rate is generally less than 50% for
dairy cows (Peralta, Pearson, and Nebel 2005) due to physi-
ological reasons (e.g., 35% of the estruses are not associated
with obvious behavioral signs - silent estruses (Palmer et al.
2010), and some signs are expressed during the night (Ker-
brat and Disenhaus 2004)). These observations call for the
development of automatic estrus detection solutions to sup-
port farmers. The gold standard is estrus estimation using
progesterone dosage in milk (Cutullic et al. 2011; Tenghe
et al. 2015). However, the cost of this solution limits its
extensive application. Commercial solutions based on af-
fordable sensor data (activity, body temperature) have been
-

developed. Nonetheless, their adoption rate remains moder-
ate (Steeneveld and Hogeveen 2015) as these solutions suf-
fer from insufficient performance and from a lack of expla-
nations supporting alerts.

Most of existing studies about the application of data
science techniques to improve automatic estrus detec-
tion (Dolecheck et al. 2015; Minegishi, Heins, and Pereira
2019; Ma et al. 2020) present detection algorithms from a
performance-only perspective and do not discuss their ex-
plainability. In addition, none of these studies uses the cur-
rently recognized method for behavioral and silent estrus
identification as labels (progesterone profiles), so their es-
trus labeling methods are not exhaustive (maximum 65%
of total estruses), therefore the high detection performance
reported do not reflect real-world conditions. A recent
study (Fauvel et al. 2019) proposes an explainability method
(SHAP (Lundberg and Lee 2017) - post-hoc model-agnostic
method) along with an ensemble detection method (LCE - a
“black-box” model, i.e. a complicated-to-understand model)
and uses the method of progesterone dosage in milk as the
reference to obtain an exhaustive estrus labeling. However,
the explanations from a post-hoc model-agnostic method
like SHAP cannot be perfectly faithful with respect to the
original model (Rudin 2019). Faithfulness is critical to re-
duce solution mistrust from the farmers as it corresponds to
the level of trust an end-user can have in the explanations of
model predictions, i.e. the level of relatedness of the expla-
nations to what the model actually computes.

Therefore, (i) we propose a new eXplainable-by-design
Pattern-based classifier for Multivariate time series (XPM)
to detect both types of estrus (behavioral/silent) with com-
bined real-world affordable sensor data (activity, body tem-
perature), which provides perfectly faithful explanations in
ways that farmers can understand based on the patterns they
could observe in animals. A pattern-based detection, i.e.
small conjunctions of symbols (Fournier-Viger et al. 2017),
is more informative to the user than other explainable ma-
chine learning methods based on subseries (e.g., shapelet
methods (Karlsson, Papapetrou, and Bostr¨om 2016)) as they
provide information about the relevant relations among the
elements of the subseries (e.g., order, time gap). Then, (ii)
we show that XPM performs better than a commercial ref-
erence in estrus detection, driven by the detection of silent
estrus. Finally, (iii) we present the limited set of patterns
needed for these detections and how it can be used to support
farmers’ decision-making.

2 Related Work

Pattern-Based Classification Multiple studies have pro-
posed different classification methods based on pattern fea-
tures, including itemset-based approaches (Cheng et al.
2007, 2008) and sequence-based classification (Buza and
Schmidt-Thieme 2010; Fradkin and M¨orchen 2014). An
itemset can be defined as a group of symbols and sequences
are ordered group of symbols. We excluded to mine more
elaborated patterns (e.g., chronicles (Dauxais et al. 2019))
due to their limited interest on the short time series we con-
sider (e.g., 4 days with one timestamp per day).

According to the results published and our experiments,
sequence-based classifiers outperform item-based ones on
average on time series data. The state-of-the-art sequence-
based classifiers are not adopted for explainability reasons.
The adoption of support vector machines and Bayesian
networks to perform classification in (Buza and Schmidt-
Thieme 2010) limits the comprehensibility of how the pat-
terns are used in the model output. Then, Fradkin and
M¨orchen (2014) classify based on discriminant sequential
patterns, i.e. patterns that are characteristic of a class. But,
the discriminant sequence mining task extracts patterns that
can also occur in other classes than those which are initially
discriminated. Thus, the classification task can lead to un-
clear explanations supporting predictions, specifically com-
municating to the user the discriminative patterns of other
classes than the one the model is predicting. So, in this study,
we mine frequent patterns without considering the class in-
formation. In addition, as stated in (Fradkin and M¨orchen
2014), direct methods (2 stages: pattern mining with class
label, classification) can reduce the number of patterns gen-
erated but can also lead to significantly worse performance
compared to indirect methods (3 stages: unsupervised pat-
tern mining, feature selection, classification). Therefore, a
new indirect pattern-based classifier using frequent sequen-
tial patterns for estrus detection is proposed in section 3.

Estrus Detection There are a couple of studies about the
application of data science techniques to improve automatic
estrus detection based on affordable sensor data (Dolecheck
et al. 2015; Fauvel et al. 2019; Minegishi, Heins, and Pereira
2019; Ma et al. 2020). Dolecheck et al. (2015) based the
study on time series data of activity, using visual detec-
tion as the ground truth (65% of all estruses). Three ma-
chine learning techniques are tested on a limited dataset of
18 estruses (18 cows): random forest, linear discriminant
and a multilayer perceptron. Minegishi, Heins, and Pereira
(2019) learnt a logistic regression on activity variables using
the combination of an automatic estrus detection solution
(collar-mounted activity meter) and visual detection as the
ground truth (total dataset: 1,462 estruses, 300 cows). Ma
et al. (2020) trained a long short-term memory network
along with a convolution neural network as estrus detection
solution based on activity data (40 cows with 6 estruses la-
beled visually). However, we cannot compare the detection
results of our algorithm to the ones from these three studies
using affordable activity measurements because the labeling
method used is not exhaustive (visual detection). As far as
we have seen, (Fauvel et al. 2019) is the only study adopt-
ing an exhaustive labeling (dataset: 125 cows - 671 estruses
labeled using progesterone dosage in milk). Therefore, we
have limited our baselines to (Fauvel et al. 2019) and the
commercial solution performance.

3 XPM
In this section, we first present our proposed approach XPM
and then detail its explainability.

XPM Presentation Estrus detection can be formulated as
a classification problem, where the input is sensor data and
the output is a class (estrus/non-estrus). More specifically,
the problem is an instance of multivariate time series clas-
sification. We have a set of co-evolving time series (7 vari-
ables), recorded simultaneously by 2 sensors (activity meter,
thermobolus), which form a multivariate time series (MTS).
As illustrated in Figure 1, our new indirect and eXplain-
able Pattern-based approach for MTS classification (XPM)
is composed of the following steps:
• Discretization: we apply SAX (Lin et al. 2003) on each
variable. SAX transforms a time series into a string using
an alphabet of predefined size. Each symbol of the alpha-
bet corresponds to an interval of a variable values set by
the algorithm, therefore SAX symbols can be interpreted
(e.g., alphabet of size 3, i.e. 3 intervals: {low, medium,
high}). We give in Figure 4 (Appendix A.1) a discretiza-
tion example on a rumination time series. Alphabet size
per variable is a hyperparameter of XPM. We limit the
alphabet size to [1,10] to obtain readable patterns and we
set 3 sizes of alphabet according to the types of variables
(alphabet 1: continuous variable - temperature, alphabet
2: integer variables - other and over activity, alphabet 3:
binary variables - the remaining variables);

• Pattern Mining: we extract
two types of patterns
for comparison - frequent
itemsets with Eclat algo-
rithm (Zaki 2000) and frequent sequences with BIDE
algorithm (Wang and Han 2004). As presented in sec-
tion 2, frequent itemsets are groups of symbols occuring
in at least a predefined percentage (support) of the time
series. For example, the itemset {=−, +, ++} present
in the rumination time series of Figure 4 (Appendix A.1)
is frequent if it occurs in at least 20% of the time se-
ries of the training set. Frequent sequences correspond to
frequent ordered groups of symbols. The type of pattern
(itemsets, sequences) and support are hyperparameters of
XPM. We restrict the support to [10%,50%] for itemsets
and [3%,9%] for sequences to not only mine high fre-
quency patterns of length 1;

• Encoding: we encode in a matrix which patterns (as
columns) are present in which MTS (as rows) to form
the input data of the classifier (see Figure 5 in Appendix
A.2);

• Feature Selection: before classification, we perform a
feature selection to keep a limited and explainable set of
patterns. We use a filter method to select the k-best pat-
terns according to a score (Chi-Square). We choose the
Chi-Square because it is suited for feature selection on
booleans data relative to classes. The number of patterns
is a hyperparameter of XPM and we limit its range to
[10,40];

• Classification: finally, we classify the MTS using a deci-
sion tree to keep the explainability on the classifier pre-
dictions. The explainability provided by the decision tree
classifier is detailed in the next section.

Explainability The explainability of our approach stems
from the communication to the farmers the presence and/or
absence of a limited number of patterns determinant of es-
trus detection. Patterns are communicated to the farmers fol-

lowing a decision tree to classify estrus. We present in this
section how to read a pattern and a decision tree. Figure 2
shows an example of a one node with two leaves decision
tree trained on a dataset of 600 MTS (300 estruses/300 non-
estruses). The node is composed of the pattern ++++ on
the variable over activity. In an alphabet of size 9 {−−−−,
−−−, −−, −, =, +, ++, +++, ++++}, ++++ refers
to the interval of highest values relative to the variable over
activity. Therefore, we observe that when a high over activ-
ity (pattern ++++ on over activity) is observed in a MTS
(pattern present), which is the case for 199 MTS, most of
the MTS correspond to estruses (184 over 199, error rate:
8%). In this case, the decision tree predicts the class es-
trus: the most represented class in the leaf. Blue filled nodes
mostly contain estruses and grey filled nodes mostly non-
estruses. When the pattern ++++ on over activity is not
observed in a MTS, the decision tree predicts non-estrus but
with a higher error rate (116/401 = 29%). Additional pat-
terns could refine the decision and reduce the error of the
tree. The explainability results are presented in section 5.

Benchmark We evaluate the performance of XPM in
comparison with a reference Commercial Solution - CS
(Medria Heatphone), the current state-of-the-art estrus de-
tection algorithm LCE (Fauvel et al. 2019) and a variant of
XPM (XPM-Derivatives). XPM-Derivatives corresponds to
XPM on a dataset augmented by the derivatives of each vari-
able. G´orecki and Łuczak (2013) show that using derivatives
can be helpful in time series classification. Derivatives cor-
respond to the value difference of a variable compared to
the previous day (see Appendix B.2 for an illustration of a
dataset augmented by the derivatives of each variable).
Hyperparameters Setting Most of the hyperparameters
of XPM presented in section 3 and summarized in Appendix
B.3 (alphabet sizes, number of patterns, time series length,
patterns, support) are determined by grid search on the val-
idation sets of the cross-validation (5-fold cross-validation
60/20/20 train/validation/test split). On the same validation
sets, decision tree hyperparameters are determined by the
hyperopt algorithm (Bergstra, Yamins, and Cox 2013).
Performance Calculation We do not make assumptions
on dairy herd management, meaning that we do not have
a preference between reducing false positives (false estrus
alerts) and false negatives (estruses not detected) so we have
optimized the F1-score, the harmonic mean between preci-
sion and recall. More details about the performance calcula-
tion are presented in Appendix B.4.

Detection Performance Firstly, we have evaluated our
XPM approach on the cross-validation dataset. We observe a
better F1-score with less variability across folds of our XPM
approach based on sequences than itemsets on both behav-
ioral and silent estruses (see Table 2 in Appendix C.1 - to-
tal: 74.5% ± 2.2 versus 73.6% ± 3.9, behavioral: 78.2% ±
3.1 versus 77.4% ± 4.2, silent: 57.7% ± 1.3 versus 56.4%
± 2.9). Thus, according to our experiments, the most infor-
mative patterns (sequences) have to be selected for estrus
detection. Moreover, patterns extracted from a dataset with
derivatives allow additional information, for example infor-
mation about the activity level of a cow, as well as vari-
ation of activity compared to the day before. We observe
that mining sequences on both raw variables and derivatives
improves F1-score compared to sequences on raw variables
(total: XPM-Derivatives 75.4% versus XPM 74.5%). There-
fore, based on the cross-validation, the best performing ap-
proach is XPM-Derivatives with Sequences (alphabet 1 size:
7, alphabet 2 size: 9, alphabet 3 size: 8, time series length:
4 days, patterns: sequences, feature selection: 20, support:
3%).

Then, we observe that on the external validation dataset
our approach has a better F1-score than the commercial solu-
tion (62.4% versus 60.9%), based on a better estrus coverage
(recall: XPM-Derivatives with Sequences 53.0% versus CS
49.1%, precision: XPM-Derivatives with Sequences 75.9%
versus CS 80.0%). The higher performance of our approach
is driven by the detection of silent estrus (F1-score: 39.2%
versus 0.0%). We infer that the lower detection performance
of our pattern-based classifier on behavioral estrus than the
commercial solution (F1-score: 56.3% versus 81.8%) is due
to the non-discriminative patterns mined. We mined patterns
based on a frequency criteria without considering the type of
estrus. Therefore, selected patterns are mostly as frequent in
behavioral as in silent estrus, which prevents to fully char-
acterize behavioral estrus. We can also compare the perfor-
mance of our approach to the existing study (Fauvel et al.
2019). The ensemble method developed (LCE) shows better
F1-score than XPM-Derivatives with Sequences (71.6% ±
0.4). Nonetheless, the ensemble approach cannot support its
predictions with perfectly faithful explanations as it relies on
a post-hoc model-agnostic explainability method (SHAP),
which can prevent LCE adoption as faithfulness is critical to
reduce solution mistrust from farmers.

Explainability Figure 8 (see Appendix C.2) shows the de-
cision tree corresponding to the best configuration deter-
mined by cross-validation. Firstly, we observe that the pres-
ence of a steep peak in over activity (root node: pattern
⟨=, −−−−⟩ on over activity derivative) leads to the iden-
tification of 49% of estruses of the training set (244 over
499 estruses) with a low error rate (3% - 7 non-estruses over
251 samples). The simultaneous presence of a pattern con-
firming the first one with a steep decrease followed by a rise
in rest (pattern ⟨−−−, =+⟩ on rest derivative) leads to a re-
finement of the detection and identifies 38% of all estruses
(191 over 499 estruses) with an error rate of 0.5% (1 non-
estrus over 192 samples). In the case of the absence of this
confirming pattern (pattern ⟨−−−, =+⟩ on rest derivative),
the presence of a steep rise of temperature leads to the identi-
fication of estrus with a low error rate of 2.5% (1 non-estrus
over 40 samples). Then, in the absence of the two patterns
relative to over activity (pattern ⟨=, −−−−⟩ on over activ-
ity derivative and pattern ⟨−, ++++⟩ on over activity), a

low rumination (pattern ⟨−−−⟩ on rumination) with a low
rest (pattern ⟨−−−⟩ on rest) confer the estrus (error rate of
21% - 9 non-estruses over 43 samples). Additional informa-
tion about the decision tree is available in Appendix C.2.

Figure 3: Example of a behavioral estrus alert with the cor-
responding patterns detected.

The explainability of our approach stems from the com-
munication to the farmers the presence and/or absence of a
limited number of patterns determinant of estrus detection.
Patterns are communicated to the farmers following the de-
cision tree shown in Figure 8 (Appendix C.2). On a daily
basis, our solution informs the farmers about the cows in
estrus, the type of estrus detected with its associated prob-
ability and the patterns which have generated the alerts. In
case of behavioral estrus, these patterns allow the farmers
to confirm the patterns visually sensed. In addition, in case
of silent estrus, our solution allows the farmers to save time
looking for non visually verifiable behavioral signs and tells
them that a potential insemination would be performed on
a silent estrus. For example, Figure 3 illustrates the level of
information that a farmer could receive with an estrus alert.
The interface contains the animal identifier, the type of es-
trus and the patterns detected. Our solution predicts that cow
1 is in behavioral estrus on the day of the alert based on the
detection in the last 3 days of a steep peak of over activity,
a steep rise in temperature and the absence of 2 patterns on
rest (a steep decrease followed by a rise in rest, an extremely
low level of rest). As indicated in the decision tree of our ap-
proach, the combination of these 2 patterns and the absence
of the patterns on rest always lead to an estrus (0% error
rate - 0 non-estrus over 21 samples), with a vast majority of
behavioral estruses (<10% of silent estruses).

6 Conclusion
Our study confirms the potential of our pattern-based clas-
sifier XPM to improve the estrus detection performance of
commercial solutions based on the combination of afford-
able sensor data (activity, body temperature), while pro-
viding perfectly faithful explanations in ways that farm-
ers can understand based on the sequential patterns they
could observe in animals. With regard to future work,
we plan to study a three class classification setting (non-
estrus/behavioral estrus/silent estrus) with discriminative
patterns to gain further insights on silent estrus detection,
as the patterns mined in silent estrus are roughly as fre-
quent as those in behavioral estrus in the two class setting
of this study (non-estrus/estrus). We also plan to work on an
approach with a broader data heterogeneity combining the
detection performance of our previous study (Fauvel et al.
2019) and the explainability of this pattern-based approach.

We present in this section a discretization example on a ru-
mination time series of length 7 with an alphabet of size 8
{−−−, −−, −, =−, =+, +, ++, +++}. Based on the in-
tervals defined by SAX, the discretization output of the time
series is: +++, +++, −−, +, =−, ++, ++.

Evaluation

B.1 Dataset
Experimental Setting An experiment was conducted at
the dairy research farm of M´ejusseaume (48°06’ N, 1°47’
W, Brittany, France) from 2014 to 2018. This experiment
enrolled 162 Holstein cows (214 lactations) housed in free
stalls. The first 3 years dataset (125 different cows) is used
for cross-validation and the last year is used for external val-
idation (61 cows). In the external validation dataset, 24 cows
are also in the cross-validation dataset but within a new lac-
tation and 37 are different. Cows calved between August
and September. At the beginning of this experiment, there
were 50% of primiparous among all cows. Primiparous cor-
respond to cows in their first lactation. The parity, i.e. the
average lactation number, were 1.8 with a standard error of

0.1. Milking occurred twice daily at 7:00-9:00 and 16:00-
18:00. Delivery of the total mixed ration containing on av-
erage 65% of maize silage, 10% of dehydrated alfalfa pel-
lets and 25% of concentrate occurred twice daily at 09:00
and 17:00. This experiment was carried out in accordance
with the guidelines for animal research of the French Min-
istry of Agriculture (d´ecret NOR AGRG 1231951D) and ap-
proved by the “Comit´e National de R´eflexion Ethique sur
l’Exp´erimentation Animale” (Authorization of the French
Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation ref-
erence APAFIS 3122-2015112718172611).

Data Collection Data were collected by affordable activ-
ity meters and body temperature sensors. Each cow was
equipped with a collar-mounted activity meter (HeatPhone
and FeedPhone - Medria Technologies, Chˆateaubourg,
France) and a temperature sensor in the reticulorumen (Ther-
mobolus - Medria Technologies, Chˆateaubourg, France).
The dataset consists of seven Medria numeric variables with
a 5-minute frequency (rumination, ingestion, rest, standing
up, over activity, other activity and temperature). Tempera-
ture takes into account the cooling effect of water ingestion
by the cows. The variables have different types: temperature
is a continuous variable; over activity and other activity are
integer variables that relate to the intensity of the activity
(values [0,10]); the remaining ones are binary variables. The
values of activity variables at each timestamp correspond to
the dominant activity during each 5-minute period. Time se-
ries are 24hr aggregated (average), which is sufficient for an
estrus alert system and a timely insemination. In addition,
the 24hr aggregation allows the mining of patterns that are
not affected by the intraday sequence of animals activities
(e.g., moment of the day a cow is drinking), which is irrele-
vant to estrus. No other preprocessing has been done to the
data collected. We assume that the processing operated by
Medria on raw data to generate variables is stable during our
experiment.

Based on its good performance compared to other solu-
tions (Chanvallon et al. 2014) and its international market
presence, we consider that Medria estrus detection system is
a reasonable basis of comparison and constitutes our base-
line. The estrus alerts of Medria Heatphone are called the
commercial solution (CS).

Gold Standard Our study covers both estrus types (be-
havioral and silent). Therefore, we labeled estrus by measur-
ing the progesterone concentration in whole milk, the costly
gold standard for an exhaustive estrus identification (Mar-
tin et al. 2013). This non-invasive method for the cow in-
duces commonly accepted errors (Adriaens et al. 2018).
Milk progesterone measurements are subject to a variability,
partly caused by the measurement technique and calibration
method (Adriaens et al. 2017), the sampling technique, or
the fat content in the milk sample (Friggens et al. 2008).

Milk samples were collected from each cow twice a week
on Tuesdays and Thursdays and were immediately frozen
at -20◦C until the dosage. We used the enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay technique (kit ELISA Ridgeway Science
Ltd). Then, with preserved and frozen milk, the separation
of basic concentrations of progesterone to estrus period has
been determined based on the quantile method (Petersson
et al. 2006; Cutullic et al. 2011).

Figure 6 shows an example of the output from the quantile
method applied on the progesterone profile of a cow on a one
month time period, and how this output is used to label the

corresponding time series, in this case of 4-day length (our
final configuration). We adopt two types of labeling: first, a
non-overlapping labeling on the cross-validation dataset to
find patterns on clearly identified periods, which improves
the relevancy of patterns used subsequently for classifica-
tion; second, a sliding window labeling on the external val-
idation dataset to evaluate the performance of our approach
on real-world conditions, i.e. as a daily monitoring solution.
The non-overlapping labeling consists of an equal number
of estrus and non-estrus time series to avoid class imbal-
ance, with the estrus MTS ending in the middle of the estrus
period and the non-estrus MTS preceding the estrus one. On
both labeling, the label of the last day is used to label the
whole time series.

Definition of Behavioral and Silent Estrus
In our analy-
sis of the results, we distinguish between the patterns char-
acteristic of behavioral and silent estrus. Silent estrus is de-
fined by the absence of obvious behavioral sign and repre-
sent around 35% of all estrus (Kerbrat and Disenhaus 2004;
Palmer et al. 2010; Ranasinghe et al. 2010). In our dataset,
an estrus is marked as behavioral estrus when either a vi-
sual detection or a CS alert occurred. Commercial solution
alerts are based on an increase in over activity. Staff obser-
vation generating visual estrus alerts occurred 4 times a day
for about 30-minute period (before milking and during rest
period at 7:00, 11:00, 15:30, 22:00). And, the estruses not
marked as behavioral estruses are silent estruses. As pre-
sented in the next section, our dataset composition is aligned
with the literature with regard to silent estrus proportion
(cross-validation: 34%, external validation: 44%).

Composition The composition of the cross-validation and
external validation datasets are presented in Table 1. The
cross-validation dataset was split into five folds. The split
has kept the same number of estruses in each fold (100).
This split does not lead to an overfit on a particular animal.
It has been studied in (Fauvel et al. 2019) that a dataset split
on animals has a negative impact on detection performance
(-2.6% impact on F1-score). We observe in our dataset that
more estruses occur in the first lactation (60%, external val-
idation: 60% of all estruses), and that cows in the first lac-
tation (primiparous) experience a higher proportion of silent
estrus compared to cows in higher lactations - multiparous

(36% vs 31%, external validation: 50% vs 34%). We do
not consider that it could bias our study. In the literature,
the effect of parity is unclear on the estrus detection per-
formance. Some authors reported greater estrus intensity for
older cows (De Silva et al. 2015; Gwazdauskas, Lineweaver,
and McGilliard 1983) while others reported a greater activ-
ity for primiparous (Van Vliet and Eerdenburg 1996; Peralta,
Pearson, and Nebel 2005; Y´aniz et al. 2006) or no differ-
ence (Van Eerdenburg et al. 2002; Lopez, Satter, and Wilt-
bank 2004).

B.2 Derivatives
Figure 7 illustrates a dataset augmented by the derivatives of
each variable.

dataset. For each timestamp, the 7 variables of our dataset
with their derivatives are represented. Abbreviations: Der -
derivatives, ID - identifier, T - time series length.

B.3 Hyperparameters
The hyperparameters of XPM are:
• Alphabet sizes: 3 alphabets are defined, according to the
types of variables (alphabet 1: continuous variable - tem-
perature, alphabet 2: integer variables - other and over
activity, alphabet 3: binary variables - the remaining vari-
ables), with sizes in [1,10];

• Time series length: it ranges from 4 to 21 days - the

length of a regular ovarian cycle ([4,21]);

• Patterns: type of patterns (itemsets, sequences);
• Number of patterns: number of patterns kept during the

feature selection ([10,40]);

than in behavioral estrus). Therefore, our pattern-based ap-
proach mostly relies on the identification of patterns that
are as much associated to behavioral estrus as to silent es-
trus (pattern ⟨=, −−−−⟩ on over activity derivative, pat-
tern ⟨+⟩ on temperature derivative, pattern ⟨−−−⟩ on rest,
pattern ⟨−−−, =+⟩ on rest derivative). It allows us to cor-
rectly classify a bit more than half of the estrus type not
detected by the commercial solution (51% of silent estrus).
In order to obtain some patterns characteristic of behavioral
and silent estrus and enhance their detection performance,
it would be interesting to work on a three class classifica-
tion setting (non-estrus/behavioral estrus/silent estrus) with
discriminative patterns.

The patterns observed corroborate some observations
from previous studies. First, over activity is significantly
higher in estrus than in non-estrus. According to the de-
vice used, activity measured in steps and neck movements
increases on the day of estrus from 69 to 170% in (Mayo
et al. 2019). Jonsson et al. (2011) show that during estrus,
the period of time cows spent lying decreases as a result of
increased activity and restlessness. Concerning the low ru-
mination pattern, a study from (Reith and Hoy 2012) reveals
that rumination reduces on the day of estrus from 7.2 to 5.9
h/d. Mayo et al. (2019) confirm this reduction by publishing
a −2 to −16% change in rumination time on the day of estrus
for both neck and ear-based technologies. Additionally, the
period of 4 days of our best configuration is aligned with the
study of (Zebari, Rutter, and Bleach 2018) which demon-
strates that on the day of behavioral estrus, the number of
the steps are higher compared to 3 days before and 3 days
after estrus.

• Support: minimum frequency of patterns (itemsets:

[10%,50%], sequences: [3%,9%]);

• Decision tree hyperparameters: depth of

the tree
[1,ln(number of patterns)], minimum number of samples
at a leaf [2,number of patterns].

B.4 Performance Calculation
We do not give a preference to reduce false positives (false
estrus alerts) or false negatives (estruses not detected) so we
have optimized the F1-score, the harmonic mean between
precision and recall. The precision measures the proportion
of actual positives among those predicted positives, and the
recall, also called sensitivity, measures the proportion of ac-
tual positives that are correctly identified as such. Adopt-
ing a conservative approach, we decided to aggregate our
model daily predictions by the maximum of the daily pre-
dictions on estrus/non-estrus period to calculate the clas-
sification performance. Based on a 5-fold cross-validation
60/20/20 train/validation/test split, the algorithm is selected
on the best F1-score on validation sets. We present two lev-
els of performance. First, we show the F1-score with pre-
cision set to the same as CS (78%, threshold: 0.4) to allow
comparison between the approaches. The threshold corre-
sponds to the value from which the pattern-based classifier
class probabilities predict estrus. The second level is the F1-
score across all possible calibrations (threshold range: 0.3-
0.75) which corresponds to the average performance of our
solution. We observe that for high thresholds (threshold >
0.75), our pattern-based classifier performance is unstable
with a significant decrease in estrus detection rate (recall be-
low 70%). In addition, for low thresholds (threshold < 0.3),
our classifier is equivalent to a random classifier. So, we de-
cided to adopt a F1-score calculation based on the average
of F1-score on threshold range 0.3-0.75, which corresponds
to the plausible range of calibration for dairy management
and shows a detection performance closer to real conditions.

Results

C.1 Detection Performance
We present in Table 2 the F1-score on test sets of our
approach on the cross-validation and external validation
datasets.

C.2 Explainability
Figure 8 presents the decision tree corresponding to the best
configuration determined by cross-validation and presented
in section 5.

Concerning the different types of estrus (silent/behav-
ioral), some patterns among the 20 patterns are characteristic
of behavioral estrus. Three patterns are three times more fre-
quent in behavioral estrus than in silent estrus MTS: pattern
⟨−, ++++⟩ on over activity, pattern ⟨−−, =⟩ on over ac-
tivity derivative and pattern ⟨−, =⟩ on over activity deriva-
tive. One of them (pattern ⟨−, ++++⟩ on over activity -
a prolonged high over activity) is used in the decision tree
as a splitting variable and the subsequent leaf contains, as
expected, one of the lowest silent estrus proportion of the
leaves (12.5%). Nonetheless, we observe that most of the
patterns used in the decision tree are present in the same
proportion in behavioral as in silent estrus MTS. There is
no pattern among the 20 patterns that is characteristic of
silent estrus (pattern at least twice more frequent in silent
