Abstract

Pl@ntNet is a scientific and citizen platform based on artificial intelligence techniques to
help participants more easily identify plants with their smartphones. The identification of
plant   species   is   indeed   an   important   step   for   many   scientific,   educational   and   land
management activities (for natural or cultivated spaces). This step, which is integrated into
various   biology   training   courses,   is   difficult   to   develop   on   a   large   scale,   even   for
professionals. This difficulty in naming plants by a very large part of the society limits the
positive interactions between humans and their environment, and thus reduces awareness
of the contribution of plants to the well-being of humanity. It is therefore essential to attempt
to solve this problem on a large geographical, taxonomic and sociological scale in order to
develop more responsible and environmentally precautionary societies.

Bonnet P et al

In the framework of the European Cos4Cloud project (2019 - 2023), which involves several
European citizen science platforms (such as iSpot in the UK, Natusfera in Spain or Artporta
len in Sweden), Pl@ntNet is developing innovative digital services aimed at:

1.

2.

facilitating   the   integration   of   automated   species   identification   into   other   citizen
science portals and
enabling researchers to use Pl@ntNet data and tools for their own research.

The services implemented will be provided on the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC),
to increase the capacity and interest of European scientists to implement citizen science
projects aimed at contributing to the sustainable development goals identified by the United
Nations.

The tools currently available on the Pl@ntNet monitoring platform, as well as the data
extraction methodologies that have enabled the publication of two large datasets on the
Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) portal, will be presented. In particular, we will
present our latest advances allowing:

•
•
•

the adaptation of Pl@ntNet services to nature reserves or botanical gardens,
the monitoring of target species for a given geographical area,
the prediction of species distribution at the national scale, based on high-resolution
remote sensing imagery.

The results of the LifeCLEF campaign, an annual international scientific and technological
benchmark based on Pl@ntNet data, will be presented to compare the latest machine-
learning techniques used to enable automated species identification and species prediction
based on geolocation. The fruit of this work, involving a large multi-disciplinary team will
illustrate   the   benefits   of   working at   the   frontier   between   biological,   digital   and   citizen
sciences.
