Abstract/Summary  

Plant architecture plays a major role in flowering and therefore in crop yield. Attempts to visualize 
and analyze strawberry plant architecture have been scarce to date. Here, we propose an open-
source software combining 2D and 3D representation of plant development over time and statistical 
methods to explore the variability in spatio-temporal development of plant architecture in cultivated 
strawberry. We applied this software to six seasonal strawberry varieties whose plants were 
exhaustively described monthly at the node scale. Results showed that the architectural pattern of 
the strawberry plant is characterized by a decrease of the module complexity between the zeroth-
order module (primary crown) and higher-order modules (lateral branch crowns (BC) and extension 
crowns). Furthermore, for each variety, we could identify traits with a central role in determining 
yield such as date of appearance and number of branches. By modeling the spatial organization of 
axillary meristem fate on the zeroth-order module using a hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov 
mathematical model, we further identified three zones with different probabilities of production of 
BC, dormant buds or stolons. This open-source software will be precious for the scientific community 
and breeders to study the influence of environmental and genetic cues on strawberry architecture 
and yield.

Introduction 

Plant architecture is one of the most important agronomic traits that determines yield in crops 
(Mathan et al., 2016). It is under genetic control (Reinhardt and Kuhlemeier, 2002; Wang and Li, 
2006) and influenced by environmental conditions (Teichmann and Muhr, 2015). The final 
architecture of the plant and subsequently the yield depends on the ontogenetic dynamics of the 
apical and axillary meristems.

Plant architecture is defined as the spatial organization of the plant (Hallé and Oldeman, 1970). In a 
typical plant architecture, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) establishes the primary axis of the plant 
by initiating a succession of vegetative entities named phytomers. A phytomer represents the basic 
unit of the plant axis and consists of an internode and a node with its attached leaf and its axillary 
bud (AXB). From this primary axis, the apical meristem from the AXB, hereafter also named AXM, will 
lead to the formation of axillary productions (branch, flower…). In sympodial growth, the SAM 
becomes a flower or an inflorescence and growth is continued by one or more apical meristems 
from the AXBs, which repeat the process in secondary axes (Schmitz and Theres, 1999). While the 
axis is a succession of phytomers, the plant is a succession of axes, primary, secondary, tertiary…. In 
this plant, the module refers to a determinate axis (primary, secondary, tertiary…) edified by a single 
SAM. The linear succession of modules constitutes an apparent axis (Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007). 
Because of the repetition of these growth and branching processes, plants can be formally described 
through rooted Multiscale Tree Graphs (MTG) whose vertices correspond to their constituting 
botanical entities and edges represent the physical connections between them (Godin and Caraglio, 
1998). In this multiscale representation, the architecture can be described at phytomer and axis 
scales (Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007) and visualized in 2D and 3D (Pradal et al., 2009; Pradal and 
Godin, 2020).

Perennial plants differ from herbaceous annual plants by their architecture, notably for their 
branching habit (Schmitz and Theres, 1999). Architecture studies have been developed for annuals 
(e.g. rice, Chen et al., 2020) and for woody perennials (Nicolini et al., 2003; Barthélémy et al., 2009). 
These studies allowed the development of models for identifying ideotypes by correlating topology 
and yield capacity (e.g. in coffea, Cilas et al., 2006). In herbaceous perennial model multiplied by 
seed, tomato is the main species studied (e.g. Safaa et al., 2009). In contrast, the architecture of 
herbaceous perennial models multiplied by vegetative propagation, such as strawberry, remains 
poorly known.

Cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria x annanassa) is the main berry fruit crop in the Rosaceae 
family. Under production conditions, new tray plants (Fig. 1A), which are daughter-plants obtained 
through vegetative propagation in nursery, are planted each year. Fruit yield is determined by the 
intensity and duration of the flowering (Fig. 1B). Following the vegetative multiplication by stolon, 
which is a specialized and highly elongated stem, SAM activity produces a primary axis, named

primary crown (PC) in strawberry (Fig. 1C). It consists of short internodes bearing adventitious roots, 
stipulated trifoliate leaves arranged in a rosette in spiral phyllotaxis of ⅖ (Savini et al., 2006), axillary 
buds (AXB) containing AXMs and is terminated by an inflorescence. Its development is sympodial: 
after its PC has stopped growing, the strawberry plant continues its vegetative growth from the 
highest AXM of the crown, which produces an axis called extension crown (EC) (Fig. 1C) (Costes et 
al., 2014). The originality of the strawberry plant is the fate of the other AXMs along the module 
(Tenreira et al., 2017; Gaston et al., 2020) as they can develop either into lateral axes named lateral 
branch crown (BC) (Sugiyama et al., 2004) or stolons, or stay dormant (Fig. 1C). Their fate, which is 
controlled by genetic and environmental factors (Tenreira et al., 2017; Andrés et al., 2021; Gaston et 
al., 2021), has direct impact on plant and fruit yield. To date, nothing is known about the spatial 
organization of these structural components and their temporal interdependencies. Indeed, the 
various attempts to visualize strawberry architecture by Guttridge (1955), and more recently by 
Savini et al. (2006) and Massenati et al. (2011), could not determine the fate of the different 
meristems of a strawberry plant according to spatial and temporal patterns.  

The objective of this work was to explore and identify the variability in spatio-temporal development 
of plant architecture among contrasting seasonal genotypes of cultivated strawberry. As strawberry 
plants are bushy and compact, we chose to dissect subsets of plants. The dissection was done at 
successive dates during the seasonal production in order to understand the architectural 
development. The plant architecture was fully described at the phytomer and module scales and 
then encoded in the MTG. In order to achieve our objective, we design a pipeline of methods 
including plant description MTG encoded and various exploratory tools, visualization techniques, 
exploratory methods and statistical modeling approach. The modeling approach relies on hidden 
hybrid Markov/semi-Markov (HMSM) chains, a variant of hidden semi-Markov chains previously 
used to analyze branching patterns in many plant species (Guédon et al., 2022). Altogether, our 
results provide a new practical framework for strawberry architecture representation and analyses 
and, beyond, for modeling plant flowering and yield.

Plant material and growth conditions 

The five seasonal flowering varieties (Capriss, Ciflorette, Clery, Darselect and Gariguette) and the 
advanced line Cir107 of cultivated octoploid strawberry were studied in Labadie et al. (2019). The 
plants of the six varieties used in the experiment were produced at a single location in a nursery in 
Douville. For the six varieties, runners bearing daughter plants emerged in mid-June from the 
mother plants. The unrooted daughter plants were taken from the runners at the end of July, kept at 
4°C in a climatic chamber for one week before being planted in trays containing a peat-based

outdoors under shade and thus subjected to the same environmental conditions (Supplementary 
Fig. S1 for temperature and global radiation conditions). To meet chilling requirements, which 
differed between genotypes (Supplementary Table S1), the tray plants were placed in a climate 
chamber at 2°C at different dates in November until plantation in December.  All the genotypes were 
planted on 10 December 2014 except Ciflorette (4 December) in soilless culture under tunnel into 
breeding ground bags (ORGAPIN) of 10L with drip irrigation and fertilization  at a minimal 
temperature of 8°C. The tunnel was opened laterally when temperatures were above 18°C.

Architectural and morphological data 

The architecture of nine plants per genotype was described approximately once per month at the 
same date in order to characterize the spatio-temporal development of the six genotypes from 
plantation (Fig. 1D) and to model their architecture (Figs 1E, 1F). The overall strategy is presented in 
Figure 2A. It should be noted that the architecture was described exhaustively at the phytomer, 
module and plant scale while the time sampling was rather scarce and the observation protocol 
consisted of plant dissection. This experimental protocol indeed favors the topological dimension 
with respect to the temporal dimension. The plant architecture was encoded in the MTG format (Fig. 
1E; Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S2 for details regarding the specification of this MTG). It defines the 
type of botanical entities (e.g. plant, axis, phytomer), their attributes and the type of relationship 
between elements (succession or branching). Each module contains a succession of phytomers with 
their type of axillary production (Fig. 2B). The order of a module corresponds to its branching order, 
i.e. the number of successive branching with zeroth-order (order 0) module for the primary crown 
(PC). We studied the three following types of axillary production: lateral branch crown (BC), which is 
a lateral extended axis with expanded leaves, stolon that is characterized by an elongated stem even 
at early stages of development, and dormant bud. Dormant buds are non-extended lateral axes in 
which leaf primordia are contained within the bud (Fig. 1C). For dormant buds, we described the 
developmental stage of their apical meristem (AXM) by binocular observation. The bud stage (Jahn 
and Dana, 1970) was classed into four categories: i) AB, aborted (meristem showing necrosis), ii) VB, 
vegetative (meristem dome is relatively flat), iii) IB, initiated (meristem dome raises above the 
developing stipules), and iv) FB, floral (from sepal development to emergence of inflorescence). The 
total number of flowers of each inflorescence was counted when inflorescence emerges. Extension 
crown (EC) (Fig. 1C) was not included in the description of axillary productions but was extracted 
when analyses were performed on the apparent axis.

Extraction of data at the module scale 

To study the occurrence along time of successive branching modules according to the genotype, the 
frequency distribution of module orders was extracted from the MTG for six successive dates of 
observation (mid-December, early-January, mid-February, early-March, early-April, early-June) and 
for each genotype. Modules considered for the statistical analysis had an order up to the fourth 
order. This is due to the absence of fifth-order modules for Clery, Capriss and Cir107 and their low 
frequencies for the three other genotypes (1 for Gariguette, 3 for Ciflorette and 1 for Darselect). The

orders. To study the composition of each module according to its order and genotype, the frequency 
distributions of the number of phytomers, number of flowers of the terminal inflorescence, and 
number of stolons were extracted for each module order and genotype by pooling all observation 
dates. These frequency distributions were explored and compared using standard statistical 
methods (e.g., ANOVA on ranks with post hoc tests for count variables) and graphical 
representations (Fig. 2B).

Extraction of data at the node scale 

3D and 2D visual exploration of the architecture 

Two types of architectural visualization were designed: i) a 3D canopy exploration and ii) a 2D 
individual schematic representation based on the MTG within the OpenAlea.Strawberry Python 
package (see in Result section hereafter). 

We investigated the homogenous zone of the axillary productions along the zeroth-order module 
and their sympodial axes using a hybrid Markov/semi-Markov model described hereafter. Sequences 
of axillary productions were extracted at the node scale along the apparent axis according to the 
rank of the phytomer along each module (Supplementary Table S3). The sample size was between 
107 sequences of cumulative length 909 for Darselect and 212 sequences of cumulative length 1707

The 2D schematic visualization (Fig. 1F; Fig. 2B) of the plant architecture is inspired from botanical 
sketches and highlights the sympodial branching as well as the different structures of the plant. The 
same representation was used for the axillary buds as in 3D. Inflorescences were visualized as a red 
rectangle. Axillary buds were represented by colored spheres according to their SAM stage. This 2D 
visualization allows summarized architectural patterns not visible in 3D such as type of axillary 
production that are not apparent in real looking 3D visualization due to the bushy habit of the 
strawberry and the apparent axis as a linear succession of modules.  

The schematic 3D visualization of the canopy (Fig. 2B) highlights the 3D spatial organization of the 
plant, including phyllotaxy. Vegetative development was represented using a color scale based on 
module order: zeroth-order (order 0, green color), first-order (order 1, red color), second-order 
(order 2, blue color), third-order (order 3, yellow color), fourth-order (order 4, purple color). The 
timing and intensity of flowering were indicated by modulating the size and shape of the light blue 
boxes representing the inflorescences (Fig. 2B).

Hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chains to model axillary productions along apparent 

The objective of our statistical modeling approach was to highlight a spatial organization of axillary 
productions. We based our statistical model on a hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markow model 
(HMSM) (Guédon, 2005; Durand et al., 2005) (Fig. 2C). The sequences used for inferring the model 
were apparent axes extracted at the node scale from architectural data with two variables:  the 
module order and its axillary productions. Module order is an instrumental variable to separate 
successive modules within the model. To this end, a HMSM was built for each genotype. A HMSM 
chain is a two-scale segmentation model whose aim is to segment apparent axes in successive 
modules and within zeroth-order modules in successive homogeneous axillary production zones. The 
model is defined by its states (Markovian and semi-Markovian), transition probabilities between 
states to model the succession of zones along the apparent axes, occupancy distributions to model 
the zone length in number of phytomers, and categorical observation distributions to model the 
axillary productions within a zone. Occupancy and categorical distributions are attached only to 
semi-Markovian states.

A hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chain (HMSM) (Guédon, 2005) can be viewed as a pair of 
stochastic processes {      } where the “output” process {  } is related to the “state” process {  }, 
which is a finite-state hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chain, by a probabilistic function or mapping 
denoted by f (hence           ). Since the mapping f is such that a given output may be observed in 
different states, the state process {  } is not observable directly but only indirectly through the 
output process {  }. This output process {  } is related to the hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chain 
{  } by the observation (or emission) probabilities                  . The definition of the 
categorical observation distributions expresses the assumption that the output process at time t 
depends only on the underlying hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chain at time t. 

        (

)        

The maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a HMSM chain requires an iterative 
optimization technique, which is an application of the EM algorithm. Once a hybrid Markov/hidden 
semi-Markov chain has been estimated, the most probable state sequence can be computed for 
each observed sequence using the so-called Viterbi algorithm; see Guédon (2003, 2005, 2007) for 
the statistical methods for hybrid Markov/hidden semi-Markov chains. In our application context, 
the most probable state sequence corresponding to the zeroth-order module can be interpreted as

the optimal segmentation of the corresponding observed sequence into successive axillary 
production zones. 

In our context, the zeroth-order module is modeled as a chain of consecutive semi-Markovian states 
to decompose it in successive axillary production zones (states 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 in Fig. 3A; distribution 
of axillary productions along the zeroth-order module in Fig. 3B). Higher order modules are modeled 
by an alternation of Markovian states corresponding to terminal inflorescences (states F0, F1, F2, F3 
and F4 represented in Fig. 3A for the Ciflorette model) followed by a semi-Markovian state to 
represent homogeneous axillary production zone within a module (states 1, 2, 3, and 4 are semi-
Markovian states in Fig. 3A).  

For zeroth-order modules, the almost deterministic succession of states was used to assess the 
number of zones. We thus expected that the states stayed ordered and that the probabilities of 
skipping states were low as a byproduct of the iterative estimation procedure of a HMSM. 

The maximum likelihood estimation procedure computes the parameters of the model, i.e. the 
probability of transition between two zones, the distribution of axillary productions for a given zone, 
and numbers of phytomers of a given zone. To this end, it uses an iterative optimization technique, 
which is an application of the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm (Ephraim and Merhav, 
2002). Once a HMSM has been estimated, the most probable state sequence can be computed for 
each observed sequence using the so-called Viterbi algorithm (Guédon, 2003; 2005; 2007). In our 
context, the most probable state sequence corresponding to the zeroth-order module can be 
interpreted as the optimal segmentation of the corresponding observed sequence into successive 
axillary production zones. 

A ccepted M anuscript

Moreover, to have a global view of the dissimilarities between the axillary production patterns of the 
genotypes, we first compute the matrix of pairwise dissimilarities between HMSM chains using the 
Kullback–Leibler divergence, and then applied a hierarchical clustering approach on this matrix 
(Guédon et al., 2003). The dissimilarity measure is computed on generated axillary production 
sequences of fixed length, systematically starting with zeroth-order modules and ending with fourth-
order modules.  We also applied this approach to the comparison of the axillary production patterns 
of the genotypes restricted to the zeroth-order modules. 

On the basis of the optimal segmentations of the observed sequences, model parameters were 
extracted for each genotype (Renton et al., 2006) in order to compare zeroth-order modules 
between genotypes on the basis of the global model estimated on the pooled sample.

Spatio-temporal  description  of  strawberry  plant  architecture  using  3D  and  2D 

representations  

     The strawberry plant has a compact structure (Fig. 1A), and therefore requires dissection to fully 
decipher its architecture. The terminal bud (TB) is located at the upper end of the primary crown 
(PC) and comprises the SAM and leaf primordia (Fig. 1C). The TB is surrounded by the petioles of 
developed leaves and is thus not visible on intact plants. The axillary buds (AXB) are located at the 
axil of each leaf and are only visible when leaves are removed. As shown in Fig. 1D, the AXB 
produces either a stolon, a lateral branch crown (BC), or remains dormant (a non-extended axis). A 
BC is a lateral axis comprising expanded leaves with an axillary meristem (AXM) at their axil and also 
an inflorescence under favorable conditions. Dissection of the AXB allows the characterization of its 
developmental stage according to the stage of its apical meristem (AXM) (Jahn and Dana, 1970; 
Gaston et al., 2021; see Materials and Methods). The meristem of a vegetative bud (VB) is 
vegetative. The meristem of an initiated bud (IB) is at the first stages of floral initiation (Fig. 1C) while 
the meristem of a flowering bud (FB) is at more advanced stages of flower and inflorescence 
development. Strawberry plant development is therefore viewed as a succession of incremental 
order modules (Fig. 1E). The zeroth-order module is the PC. Along this module, AXBs will produce 
either first-order modules (BC or extension crown, EC) or stolons, as shown in the 2D representation 
of the plant (Fig. 1F). BC and EC will produce higher order modules and stolons etc.

We reasoned that spatio-temporal variations in module-orders in cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x 
ananassa) should result in a diversity of plant architecture and flowering patterns and ultimately in 
yield patterns. To test this hypothesis, we studied six strawberry genotypes contrasting in plant 
architecture and fruit yield. The architecture was described exhaustively at the phytomer, module 
and plant scale levels using an experimental protocol that favors the topological dimension with 
respect to the temporal dimension. The plant architecture was encoded in the MTG format (Fig. 1E; 
Supplementary Table S2 for details regarding the specification of this MTG). It allowed us to obtain 
2D (Fig. 1F) and 3D representations of the plant.  

The 3D visualization of the canopy enabled the visual exploration of the reconstructed plants in 
order to determine the spatial organization, the flowering intensity and the phenology of the 
different genotypes (Fig. 4A for Ciflorette; Supplementary Figs S2, S3 for all genotypes). We can 
observe that at planting (mid-December) all the Ciflorette individuals consisted of zeroth- and first-
order (green and red respectively) modules. Then, second-order (blue) modules appeared in mid-
February. Third-order (yellow) and fourth-order (purple) modules appeared in early-May. Strikingly, 
the nine individuals of each genotype at each successive date of observation show a homogenous 
development, with similar module order distributions. When comparing all genotypes, we observed 
that they differed by their earliness of module development (Supplementary Fig. S2). For Gariguette, 
Clery and Ciflorette, first-order modules appeared in mid-February while they appeared in early-
January for Capriss and Cir107 and in mid-December for Darselect. Second-order modules appeared

Cir107 and Darselect. Third- and fourth-order modules appeared at the last date of observation 
(early-June) except for Darselect, for which third-order modules appeared in early-April. The six 
genotypes also showed marked differences in of flowering intensity, which is reflected in the 
different sizes of the light blue boxes representing the number of flowers per inflorescence, clearly 
visible in 3D visualization without leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). For Gariguette and Cir107, 
flowering was already intense for all plants in early-March while at this date, flowering started for 
the four other genotypes.

The 2D representation of the spatio-temporal architecture is represented by the most central plant 
for each date of the six successive observations (Fig. 4B for Ciflorette; Supplementary Fig. S4 for all 
genotypes). This representation highlights the succession of incremental order modules (Fig. 4C), the 
spatio-temporal development of branching, and its variability between genotypes (Supplementary 
Fig. S4). AXB description was summarized by the stage of its meristem. As an example, along plant 
development, Ciflorette produced BC in addition to its EC (Figs 4B, C). These branches occurred 
mainly in the proximal and distal zones of the PC (zeroth-order module). In this zeroth-order, AXB of 
the median zone were dormant and already initiated at plantation; they did not develop into BC 
during plant development and dried (rated as aborted). Comparison of 2D architectures between 
the six genotypes shows that they differ by their complexity and in particular by their branching 
behavior. This difference in branching leads to different numbers of BC. In early-June, Gariguette 
showed two apparent axes, while Ciflorette, Clery and Darselect, three, and Capriss and Cir107 four 
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, distribution of BC along the zeroth-order module differed 
between genotypes, the three of Capriss and Cir107 being distributed from the bottom to the top 
while the single ones of Gariguette were at the top. However, the six genotypes were very similar 
with respect to the fate of the AXB localized on the median zone of the zeroth-order since they were 
almost all initiated at plantation and stayed dormant or aborted during the experiment.

Regardless of their differences, the strawberry genotypes share a common architectural pattern

modules (2-4) (Fig. 5A), the number of phytomers of the modules of order ≥ 1 being roughly 

constant  for  most  of  the  genotypes  (see  the  linear  trends  estimated  for  the  number  of 

phytomers as a function of the order for order ≥ 1 in Supplementary Table S4).

linear trends estimated for the number of flowers as a function of the order for order ≥ 2 in 

Supplementary Table S4). 

●  The presence of stolons in zeroth-order modules, their absence  in first-order modules and 

their  almost  absence  in  second-order  modules,  then  the  number  of  stolons  per  module 

increasing with the module order onward (Fig. 5C). 

Finally, concerning the number of modules of order ≥ 1, Capriss and Cir107 were the most bushy 
genotypes with the highest numbers of first- and second-order modules while Gariguette, Clery and 
Darselect were the less bushy genotypes with the lowest numbers of first- and second-order 
modules, Ciflorette being intermediate between these two groups (Supplementary Table S3). 

Concerning the stolons, the situation is contrasting between zeroth-order modules and modules of 
order ≥ 3 (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S7). For instance, Capriss exhibited the highest number of 
stolons for the zeroth-order module and the lowest for third-order modules while Ciflorette 
exhibited an intermediate number of stolons for the zeroth-order module but the highest number of 
stolons by far for third- and fourth-order modules.  

There are quantitative differences between genotypes, these differences being more pronounced 
for the zeroth-order modules and for flowering intensity (Figs 5A-C). Concerning the vegetative 
development, the genotypes can be ordered in the following way according to the number of 
phytomers of the zeroth-order module (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S5): {Gariguette, Capriss, 
Cir107} > {Ciflorette, Clery} > Darselect. Concerning the complexity of the terminal inflorescence, in 
term of the number of flowers, Gariguette and Cir107 were the genotypes with the most complex 
inflorescences whatever the module order while Capriss exhibited the least complex inflorescences 
(Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S6). For the three other genotypes with intermediate inflorescence 
complexity (Ciflorette, Clery and Darselect), the complexity varies according to the module order.  

A ccepted M anuscript

To assess the dates of occurrence of successive module orders (Table 1), we used high-quantile 
criteria (0.9-quantile) that rely on the whole distribution of module order (Supplementary Table S8 
for details on the distribution of module order for successive date). We used this approach to take 
into account the small sample sizes (nine individuals per observation date for each genotype) and 
the non-robustness of the maximum criterion. It should be noted that the highest module order was 
relatively homogeneous between individuals of a given genotype for each successive observation 
date as illustrated by the 3D visualization of individuals in Supplementary Fig. S2. This statistical 
analysis also revealed differences between the six genotypes with regard to the timing of module 
orders. At plantation (mid-December), all genotypes were composed of zeroth and first- order 
modules except Gariguette, for which the first module order occurred one month later (early-
January). Second-order modules occurred less than one month later for Cir107 (early-January) and 
less than two months after for Capriss, Ciflorette and Darselect (mid-February). It is noteworthy that 
second-order modules occurred late for Clery and Gariguette (mid-March). Third-order modules 
occurred earlier for Darselect (mid-March) than for the five other genotypes (early-June). At the last

date of observation, the highest module order was 3 for Capriss and Cir107 and 4 for Gariguette, 
Clery, Ciflorette and Darselect (Table 1). Overall, these results suggest differences in module 
occurrence along the culture according to genotypes. 

Three  well-differentiated  successive  zones  in  zeroth-order  module  based  on  axillary 

productions using a mathematical model 

The empirical probabilities of the axillary productions were extracted from the observed sequences 
synchronized from the top or from the base along the zeroth-order module. These empirical 
probabilities show a proximal stolon zone followed by a FB median zone when extracted from both 
the base and the top except for Gariguette (Fig. 6; and Supplemental Fig. S5, respectively). A distal 
short lateral BC zone (always a single phytomer) is observed when empirical probabilities were 
extracted from the top (Supplementary Fig. S5) but with a lower probability for Darselect (0.35) 
compare to the five other variety (>0.60) (Table 2). We thus assumed that three well-differentiated 
successive zones (semi-Markovian states: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) can be identified in the zeroth-order module 
until F0 Markovian state (i.e. inflorescence of the zeroth-order module) for all genotypes except 
Gariguette. For Gariguette, we assumed that only two well-differentiated successive zones could be 
identified (the three zones assumption was tested but, in this case, the iterative estimation 
algorithm of the HMSM chain led to two first zones in parallel with rather similar compositions in 
terms of axillary productions). A HMSM chain was built for each genotype (Ciflorette in Fig. 3 and all 
genotypes in Supplementary Fig. S6; Tables 2, 3).  

A ccepted M anuscript

A global model was also built on the basis of the pooled sample with three zones for zeroth-order 
modules from which zone lengths and compositions were extracted for each genotype on the basis 
of the optimal segmentation in zones (Supplementary Table S9). This global model shows that the 
three successive zones in zeroth-order modules (proximal stolon zone, median bud zone and distal 
short BC zone) are reasonably shared by all the genotypes. We obtained high percentages of match 
between the segmentations in three zones obtained using the global model and the genotype-
specific model for all the genotypes (97% to 65.2%; Gariguette was excluded from the analysis). This 
global model also shows that both the probability of skipping the proximal zone is the highest and 
the probability of observing stolons in this proximal zone is the lowest for Gariguette 
(Supplementary Tables S9, S10). This is consistent with the impossibility of identifying this zone on 
the basis of the sole Gariguette sample.  

We also built models with one more zone at the base of zeroth-order modules for Capriss and Cir107 
consistently with the high empirical probability of observing a lateral branching at the base of 
zeroth-order modules for these two genotypes (Supplemental Fig. S5). This short zone was modeled 
by a Markovian state and confirms the specificity of Capriss and Cir107 regarding this pattern 
(Supplementary Fig. S7; Supplementary Tables S11) which explains their bushy habit with far more 
first- and second-order modules compared to the other genotypes (Supplementary Table S3).

Axillary meristem fate depends on the module order 

Higher-order modules were modeled with only one homogeneous zone. We observed and 
quantified that first and second order modules contain predominantly VB and FB for all genotypes 
(Supplemental Table S12; Fig. 3A for Ciflorette). From third-order modules, we showed an increase 
in the proportion of stolons, depending on the genotypes, at the expense of the proportion of FB, as 
illustrated in Fig. 3A and Supplemental Table S12.  

Global comparison of genotypes 

Dissimilarity measures between models corresponding to succession of modules from zeroth to 
fourth order estimated for each genotype (Table 2) and between models restricted to zeroth-order 
modules were computed. The clustering of genotypes (Fig. 7) on the basis of matrix of pairwise 
dissimilarity measures between models mainly reflects the difference between zeroth-order 
modules (Table 2): 

The transition probability evaluated the AXM fate of two successive buds in modules of order 
superior to zeroth-order (>= 1) (Supplementary Table S13). The probability close to 1 for the 
transition ‘BC → EC’ suggests that BC are systematically followed by an EC, in the last phytomer of 
the module. Moreover, the transition probability leading to stolon (Supplementary Table S14) shows 
that stolons are rarely preceded by another axillary production in the module order ≥1. In summary, 
when lateral branching is observed in module orders superior to zeroth-order (86 BC for top 
modules versus 1053 EC), BC were at the top and stolons were at the base of the module.  

A ccepted M anuscript

It should be noted that this clustering is consistent with the ordering of genotypes according to the 
number of phytomers of the zeroth-order module (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S5) with 
{Gariguette,Capriss, Cir107} > {Ciflorette, Clery} > Darselect and with the far more bushy habit of 
Capriss and Cir107 with respect to the other genotypes (Supplementary Table S3). The 2D schematic 
representation of most central individuals (Supplementary Fig. S4) highlights the delayed 
appearance of first-order modules in Gariguette and the more basal branching of Capriss and Cir107, 
and to a lesser extent of Ciflorette. 

●  Ciflorette and Clery with the highest proportion of FB in the median bud zone; 

●  Capriss and Cir107 with far more BC at the base of the zeroth-order module; 

●  Darselect with few FB in the median zone and few BC in the distal zone. 

●  Gariguette with no well-defined proximal stolon zone; 

Open-source software and web application for 3D visualization and architectural analysis 

Three software artifacts (Fig. 2) have been developed for the analysis and visualization of strawberry 
architectural data and development: i) the OpenAlea.Strawberry Python package, ii) a set of 
interactive Jupyter Notebook tutorials, and iii) an end-user web application. First, 
OpenAlea.Strawberry is an open-source Python package (https://github.com/openalea/strawberry), 
available in the OpenAlea platform (Pradal et al., 2008, 2015). OpenAlea.Strawberry relies mainly on

Python 3, OpenAlea.PlantGL (Pradal, et al., 2009), and OpenAlea.MTG (Pradal and Godin, 2020). It 
provides methods for the architecture reconstruction, analysis at the node and module scale, and 2D 
and 3D visualization. As shown in Fig. 2, it enables to a) load a MTG file format that encodes in a 
standard way (topology and property) the description of strawberry architectural data and provides 
a generic and multiscale MTG data structure , b) visualize in 2D and 3D architectural data of one 
plant, one or several genotypes), c) analyze the architectural data at different scales (i.e. node, 
module and plant scales) by providing various exploratory functions to plot and extract data for 
further analysis such as estimation of HMSM models. Second, the Jupyter Notebook tutorials, 
designed for scientists, provide an interactive web interface to illustrate the various steps of the 
pipeline and run existing analyses in a reproducible way (Kluyver et al., 2016). The full software and 
user documentation, including some tutorials, is available and updated after each change 
(https://strawberry.rtfd.io). Finally, a web application has been designed on the top of the 
OpenAlea.Strawberry package to automatically visualize and analyze strawberry architecture for 
end-users such as breeders. A demonstration of the application is provided through a video (see 
Supplementary Video, https://data.inrae.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.57745/XJY5RO). This 
application is built using Voilà and Jupyter frameworks. The web application can be installed directly 
from github or using the Docker image (Merkel, 2014) available on DockerHub 
(https://hub.docker.com/r/openalea/strawberry) for faster deployment. 

A ccepted M anuscript

In strawberry as in other crop species, flower and fruit production is highly dependent on plant and 
inflorescence architecture (Eshed and Lippman, 2019). In addition to yield, the timing and duration 
of fruit production, which is also related to the architecture of the plant, is an essential trait for 
strawberry growers and breeders (Hytönen et al., 2008; Gaston et al., 2013; Perrotte et al., 2016; 
Tenreira et al., 2017; Andrés et al., 2021). Compared to most other crops, the specificity of 
strawberry is that AXB apical meristem (AXM) can produce either a branch (lateral or extension axis), 
a dormant bud (lateral non-extended axis) or a stolon (Savini et al., 2006; Costes et al., 2014; Fig. 
4C). Furthermore, the fate of the AXM depends on its position on the axis, as demonstrated here. An 
additional level of complexity in strawberry is that acquiring high-resolution plant architecture 
datasets requires a destructive step, namely dissecting the primary crown (PC), which is a compact 
structure (Tenreira et al., 2017). Powerful tools are thus required to analyze the large and complex 
datasets produced by phenotyping and to represent the evolution over time of 2D and 3D 
architectures of plant and inflorescence and their impact on flower and fruit production.

To address these challenges, we first developed a free and open-source software library and web 
application, called OpenAlea.Strawberry, that allows the analysis of phenotypic traits relevant to 
strawberry architecture, which include the occurrence of branching modules according to their 
order, as well as the complexity of inflorescences. By combining 2D and 3D representation of 
strawberry plant development and exploratory statistical methods, our software enables 
comprehensive comparison of branching structure and inflorescence complexity in plants from 
diverse genotypes or under different environmental conditions. Using OpenAlea.Strawberry, we 
could analyze over time the phenotypic variation in plant and inflorescence architecture of six 
strawberry genotypes that were extensively described monthly at node scale. By considering the 
spatio-temporal growth of the plant and formally describing plants through Multiscale Tree Graphs 
(MTG) (Godin and Caraglio, 1998), we were able to highlight and analyze the diversity of the growth 
strategies used by the various strawberry genotypes to build their architecture. 

We then extracted from OpenAlea.Strawberry the data needed to build a model to identify 
homogeneous zones for axillary productions. This model explicitly integrates the local scale of the 
phytomer and the more macroscopic scale of the branching zone, and allows for the study of spatial 
and temporal dependencies between different modules (Peyhardi et al., 2017). Using the HMSM 
chain (Guédon, 2005; Guédon et al., 2022), we could show that the zeroth-order module (PC) is 
structured, regardless of genotype (except Gariguette), into three distinct and homogeneous zones 
with respect to AXM fate. The three zones produce either stolons and BC (basal zone), dormant buds 
(central zone) or BC (proximal zone). In higher-order modules derived from the extension axis, AXM 
fate depends on order level, and the proportion of stolons increases with the module order. The 
increase in the proportion of stolons is likely due to long days (Kurokura et al., 2005; Messetani et 
al., 2011; Labadie et al., 2019) and/or low apical dominance (Neri et al., 2003). The original data 
produced by our analyses represent a significant advance over previous studies that did not consider 
the time scale or dependencies between different modules (Massenati et al., 2011; Bosc et al., 
2012). They further allow comparison with Rosaceae tree species, for example apple and apricot, 
where the axis is structured in consecutive zones homogeneous in their axillary productions (Renton 
et al., 2006; Costes et al., 2014; Mészáros et al., 2020). In strawberry, OpenAlea.Strawberry can be 
used to study the influence of the environment on the possible fluctuation of the three zones, as 
shown in apple (Mészáros et al., 2020). 

A ccepted M anuscript

The power of the approach describing the module orders at spatial and temporal levels (Peyhardi et 
al., 2017) was highlighted by the demonstration that the occurrence of module orders varies 
according to the genotype. Moreover, the time elapsed between the occurrence of two successive 
module orders can be more or less extended depending on the genotype (Table 1). By comparing 
the results from our temporal study of the architecture with the previous phenological analysis 
carried out on the same trial (Labadie et al., 2019), we could further link the occurrence and time 
elapsed between two successive module orders with the flowering patterns of each of the six 
genotypes (Fig. 8). In strawberry, the first flush of flowering is mainly produced by the zeroth- and 

The date of occurrence of successive module orders has a major impact on flowering patterns

Genetic diversity in shoot branching is likely related to variability in apical dominance 

first-order modules (Massetani and Neri, 2016; Bosc et al., 2012) (Fig. 8). These modules are initiated 
in the nursery when temperature and day length are reduced (Opstad et al., 2011; Heide et al., 
2013). The resumption of flower production in May for Clery and Gariguette (Labadie et al., 2019) 
takes place approximately two months after the occurrence of the second-order modules (in March), 
which is consistent with a period of about 9 weeks between floral initiation and inflorescence 
emergence (Battey et al., 1998; Sønteby and Heide, 2008). In the Capriss, Cir107, Ciflorette and 
Darselect genotypes, the first flush of flowering is not followed by a stop in the appearance of 
flowers because the flowering of the second-order module takes over very quickly from that of the 
zeroth- and first-order modules. Our findings have considerable consequences for strawberry 
breeding, as shortening the intervals between the occurrence of module orders is critical for growers 
to control the yield and duration of fruit production (Kurokura et al., 2005). Indeed, a main goal of 
growers is to avoid the interruption of the production. 

A ccepted M anuscript

In strawberry, shoot branching plays a central role in controlling fruit yield because each axis is 
terminated by an inflorescence when the environment is favorable (Kurokura et al., 2017; Tenreira 
et al., 2017; Gaston et al., 2020; Gaston et al., 2021). Our 2D and 3D plant architecture 
representation indicated the great diversity for this trait among the various genotypes studied, 
which led to more or less bushy plants (Supplementary Figs S2-S4). Thanks to our HMSM model, we 
could further show that branching occurs with very high probability in the very short distal zone (a 
single phytomer) and in the proximal zone. Branching is regulated by apical dominance, which exerts 
control over axillary bud outgrowth from the shoot apex (Cline, 1997; Barbier et al, 2017). Apical 
dominance is released when the SAM becomes floral or is removed, for example by grazing or 
pruning, thus allowing axillary buds to grow and new axes to form. In strawberry, an apex excision 
experiment (Neri et al., 2003) showed that lower AXBs, i.e. those corresponding to our basal zone, 
can develop into BC when the buds are released from apical dominance. As previously suggested by 
Sugiyama et al. (2004) and observed in tomato (Lifschitz and Eshed, 2006), the genetic diversity 
observed among the six genotypes studied could be due to variability in the capacity of their axillary 
buds to be released from apical dominance. In the two bushy genotypes Capriss and Cir107, the 
lower effect of dominance could lead to the specific fourth zone of branching observed in the basal 
part of the plant (Supplementary Fig. S7; Supplementary Table S11). These findings underline the 
importance of branching on the zeroth-order module for increasing the number of inflorescences of 
the plant. They further lay the foundation for breeding new strawberry cultivars with specific 
branching features adapted to the various patterns of fruit production required by the growers. 

The inflorescence complexity dictates the intensity of the first flowering flush 

In addition to branching, inflorescence architecture is a key agronomical factor for yield (Eshed and 
Lippman, 2019; Gaarslev et al., 2021; Koppolu et al., 2022). In agreement with Guttridge (1955) and 
Ridout et al. (1999), we clearly show that the inflorescences of the zeroth-order module produced 
more flowers and therefore showed more complex inflorescences. We further demonstrate here

Future directions 

that there is a sharp decrease of inflorescence complexity on the first-order module, followed by a 
slower reduction until stabilization in the higher-order modules (Fig. 5). Variations in the 
inflorescence complexity produced by the first two modules should therefore considerably affect the 
number of flowers produced by the plant. In agreement with previous findings (Darrow, 1929; 
Battey et al., 1998), we observed that the genetic background has a strong influence on 
inflorescence architecture. Moreover, of the six varieties studied, the two genotypes with the most 
complex inflorescences on the zero-order and first-order modules, Gariguette and Cir107, also 
exhibit the most intense first flush of flowering (Labadie et al., 2019) (Fig. 8). This trait is of the 
utmost importance to growers and constitutes a major breeding target for the control of fruit yield 
in strawberry. According to our results, breeding programs aimed at controlling the intensity of the 
first flowering flush should focus on the complexity of the first inflorescences. To translate flowering 
into fruit production, however, care should be taken to maintain the reproductive success of all 
flowers (Rindom and Hansen, 1995). 

A ccepted M anuscript

The genetic and molecular control of plant and inflorescence architecture has been deciphered in 
many domesticated crop species such as rice, maize and tomato (Wang and Li, 2006; Liu et al., 2013; 
Park et al., 2014a; Gaarslev et al., 2021). This knowledge has been widely exploited to increase crop 
yield (Eshed and Lippman, 2019), for example in tomato, a sympodial fruit-bearing species like 
strawberry (Gaston et al., 2020). In tomato, considerable increase in fruit yield has been achieved 
through genetic and biotechnological control of branching (Park et al., 2014b) and inflorescence 
complexity (Rodriguez-Leal et al., 2017). In strawberry, the plant architecture and thus the trade-off 
between fruit yield (through flowering) and daughter plant yield (through runners) depends on the 
fate of the AXM (Tenreira et al., 2017; Gaston et al., 2020; Gaston et al., 2021). The subsequent 
difficulty of phenotyping and analyzing plant architecture, in particular, has so far prevented 
progress similar to that in tomato, although significant advances have been made in our 
understanding of flowering regulation (Kurokura et al., 2017; Gaston et al., 2021) and AXM fate 
(Tenreira et al., 2017; Caruana et al., 2018; Andrés et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2022).  

The free and open-source software library and web application provided here will allow users to 
analyze phenotypic traits related to strawberry architecture and yield, including the occurrence of 
modules and complexity of inflorescences. There are numerous directions for applied and basic 
research. Our tool and strategy described here will prove particularly useful to strawberry breeders 
for whom controlling yield pattern throughout the production period is essential. Future 
developments will, for example, use the data extracted from OpenAlea.Strawberry to predict the 
yield of a given strawberry variety based on its architecture and reproductive success. It will also be 
used to screen genetic resources by genome-wide association study and obtain information on the 
genetic control of phenotypic traits related to architecture, as well as to analyze the modulation of 
plant architecture by the environment, for example by light or temperature (Rantanen et al., 2014; 
Ye et al., 2021).

(A) Tray plant at plantation.
(B) Soilless culture of strawberry in a glasshouse with a focus on flowering and fruiting plants.
(C) Schematic representation of a primary crown (PC). PC includes stem (S), terminal bud (TB) and leaves with their
axillary buds (AXB), which are dormant buds (non-extended lateral axes). A lateral branch crown (BC) is also
represented. TB includes SAM and leaf primordia (LP). The uppermost AXB will produce the extension crown (EC).
Vegetative AXB includes AXM and LP. L, leaf. ST, stolon. R, root.
(D) Dissection of the plant with leaf order according to the rank of the node (numbered from 1 to 15). In the grey
rectangle on the left, the leaves with either stolon or AXB at their base. In the grey rectangle on the right, detail of
the dissection of the TB.
(E) MTG formalism of the plant with stage property. Colors represent the module order: green for order 0, red for
order 1 and blue for order 2. Botanical entities as named in MTG: F, leaf; f, leaf primordium (leaf enclosed in the
bud); ST, stolon; BT, bud; ht, inflorescence enclosed in BT; HT: visible inflorescence (not represented in this plant);
FB: Floral Bud; VB: Vegetative Bud. ‘+‘ indicates a branching link and ‘< ‘ a succession link.
(F) 2D schematic representation of the plant generated by the OpenAlea.Strawberry package. Only the PC (zeroth-
order module) is represented. The colored spheres indicate the non-visible/undeveloped higher-order modules

Figure 2. An end-to-end pipeline for the architectural analysis of strawberry with the OpenAlea.strawberry package developed in
Python on the OpenAlea platform
(A) Architectural data from the strawberry plants were acquired after dissection. Production of axillary buds and the stage of all
terminal meristems were described.
(B) Data were transposed in MTG formalism. The pipeline allows users to visualize architectural data in 3D and 2D and explore
data at different scales: plant, module or node scale. In the 2D visualisation, an example of module (here the zero-order module)
composed of a succession of phytomers is surrounded by red. The succession of modules is represented by a diagonal division
between the modules at an angle of 30°, while the branching is represented by a horizontal division at an angle of 90°. TB:
Terminal Bud; FB: Floral Bud; IB: Initiated Bud; VB: Vegetative Bud; BC: Lateral Branch Crown; ST, Stolon.
(C) In addition to the strawberry package, a statistical Markov analysis model (HMSM model) was developed to characterize
homogeneous zones of axillary productions along apparent axes .

Figure 3. Schematic representations of the Hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chain estimated for
Ciflorette.
(A) Hidden Hybrid Markov/semi-Markov chain and its parameters values. Each vertex represents either a
Markovian or a semi-Markovian state. Markovian states correspond to terminal inflorescences with their
module orders (states F0, F1, F2, F3 and F4). Semi-Markovian states represent zones within the zeroth-
order module (0.1: proximal zone, 0.2: median zone, 0.3: distal zone) and module orders (1,2,3,4).
Transition probabilities are represented by arrows between states (edge). Transition probabilities are
noted nearby when < 1. The observation distributions which represent the zone composition (proportions
of axillary productions) and the occupancy distributions which represent the zone length in number of
nodes are attached to each state and are at the bottom of the corresponding vertex. For zone
composition: x-axis: AB: aborted bud, VB: vegetative bud, IB: initiated bud, FB: floral bud), stolon (ST) or
lateral branch crown (BC); y-axis: probability mass. For occupancy distribution: x-axis: number of
successive nodes (# nodes); y-axis: probability mass.
(B) Hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov summarized on plant architecture for zeroth-order module. Each
zone is represented by a color box: green for proximal zone, red for median zone, and purple for distal
zone. Each zone was characterized by the mean length zone (mean no. phytomers) and the non-
generated observation distribution of axillary productions (in percentage) indicated and colored in data
bars. Axillary productions were axillary buds (AXB) determined by the developmental stage of their AXM
(AB: aborted bud, VB: vegetative bud, IB: initiated bud, FB: floral bud), stolon (ST) or lateral branch crown
(BC).

Figure 4. Spatio-temporal architecture of strawberry plant using 3D and 2D representations.
(A) 3D representation of the 9 plants of the genotype Ciflorette during the seasonal production. The seasonal
production is represented by six successive dates of observation. Colors represent module orders: green for
order 0, red for order 1, blue for order 2, yellow for order 3, and purple for order 4. The size of the light blue
boxes representing the inflorescence is proportional to the number of open flowers.
(B) 2D representation of the genotype Ciflorette during the seasonal production. The spatio-temporal
architecture of Ciflorette is summarized by the representation of the most central individual for each date of
observation. The representation of the development of a given genotype is discontinuous between two dates
because the acquisition of the architecture require dissection and is destructive. At each date, a new plant of
the same genotype is represented. Each organ is represented by a geometrical shape: inflorescence, red box;
phytomer (internode + petiole + 3 leaflets), green cylinder terminated by three green discs; stolon, black
arrow; axillary bud (AXB), a sphere colored according to the stage of the terminal meristem (green, yellow, red
or brown for respectively vegetative, initiated, floral or aborted/dried stage). Lateral branch crown and
extension crown are represented by horizontal or oblique shifts respectively. Apparent axes are materialized
by the succession of extension module order from zeroth-order module or from a lateral branch crown.
(C) 2D representation of the most central plant of the genotype Ciflorette at the last date of observation.
Module order rank is indicated by the number on the side of each module. At this last observation date, the
dry dormant buds observed were considered as aborted buds. They were mainly located on the zero-order
module.

Figure 6. Probabilities of the axillary productions as a function of the node rank for Gariguette, Ciflorette,
Clery, Capriss, Darselect and Cir107. The node rank is ordered from the base to the top of the zeroth-order
module without the last node bearing the extension crown. Axillary productions were axillary buds (AXB)
determined by the developmental stage of their AXM (AB: aborted bud, VB: vegetative bud, IB: initiated
bud, FB: floral bud), stolon (ST) or lateral branch crown (BC).

Figure 7. Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of axillary production
patterns of the six varieties on the basis of matrix of pairwise
dissimilarity measures between models. The matrix of pairwise
dissimilarity was calculated on the basis of Kullback-Leibler
divergences between estimated hybrid hidden Markov/semi-
Markov chains for (A) zeroth-order modules and (B) succession of
modules from zeroth to fourth order. The length of the edge
between two genotypes in each dendrogram represent
the
distance or dissimilarity between these genotypes. The sign +
indicates the terminal node of the clustering tree.

Figure 8: Relationships between flowering phenological phases and architectural data.
(A) Phenological phases were identified using a longitudinal data modeling approach, which highlighted two patterns of
flowering: two flushes separated by a phase of lower flower production (pattern 1) or a single flush (pattern 2). Flowering
intensity was dependent on genotype. Calendar days and months are indicated in the axis-x.
(B) Architectural study with module order occurrence identified by quantile 0.9 and inflorescence complexity (flower
numbers per inflorescence according to the module order).
(C) Duration of the flowering period according to the module order.
Altogether, these results show that the intensity of flower production for the first flush is related to the complexity of the
inflorescence at the zeroth and first-order modules. The presence of a near-stop of flowering in genotypes displaying the
pattern 1 can be explained by a delay in the occurrence of the second-order module. The absence of flowering stop after
the first flush in genotypes displaying the pattern 2 may be due either to the rapid relay of second-order modules for
flowering, or to a higher production of lateral branch crowns.
