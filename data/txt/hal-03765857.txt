LOV-ES: Guiding the Ontology Selection to Structure
Textual Data using Topic Modeling

Abstract
On-line availability of text corpora nowadays allow data practitioners to build complex knowledge
combining various sources. One common shared challenge lays in the modelisation of intermediate
knowledge structures able to gather at once the various topics present in the texts. Practically, practi-
tioners often go through the creation of vocabularies. In order to help these domain experts, we design
LOV-ES: a solution able to help them in this creative process, guiding them in the selection and the
combination of already existing vocabularies available online. Technically, our solution relies on LDA to
detect topics and on the LOV to then propose candidate vocabularies.

Keywords
Topic Modeling, Textual source, LDA, LOV, Vocabulary Recommender

1. Introduction

Since its early days, natural language processing has knowledge acquisition as a prominent goal.
Formally, we would like to have machines able to read text and express its embedded knowledge
in a formal representation so to rely on it to later solve various problems. One of the first tasks
to tackle in this context is therefore to have an ontology able to capture the knowledge structure
of the considered texts: the ontology induction.

Ontology induction (constructing an ontology) and ontology population (mapping textual
expressions to concepts and relations in the ontology) have been explored by the community [1].
In particular, early efforts have been made to bridge Semantic Web and ontology learning [2,
3]; and machine learning approaches were developed [4, 5], some being unsupervised [6].
Nevertheless, as highlighted by Tsujii [7], most approaches induce and populate a deterministic
ontology, which does not capture the uncertainty among entities and relations. Moreover, they
focus on inducing ontology over individual words rather than arbitrarily large meaning units.
In parallel, the Semantic Web community has been structuring many knowledge domains
in an open manner, i.e. sharing their datasets and their ontologies, see e.g. the LOD-cloud1
and the LOV-dataset2 providing data on respectively open linked datasets and vocabularies.
As a consequence, in this article, we propose to rely on these available resources to design

a vocabulary recommender from text, aiming to guide and help data practitioners in their
ontology selection and design process. Following a similar goal, domain-specific solutions have
been designed e.g. for medical data [8].

In this article, we propose an end-to-end solution named LOV-ES for Linked Open Vocabulary
Enhanced Selection. We show how LDA and SPARQL [9] can be associated to obtain a list of
candidate vocabularies. Moreover, we propose a metric to rank the vocabularies against each
other (combining words’ weights and vocabulary frequencies in the list) in order to suggest the
most relevant results.

2. Vocabulary Suggestion using LDA

The LOV initiative created in 2014 [10] has contributed to the deployment of Linked Data
providing a high-quality catalogue of reusable vocabularies for the description of data on the
Web. Currently, the LOV gathers around 800 vocabularies in more than 50 languages ranging
from English to French. The task of Topic Modeling consists of discovering abstract semantic
themes, or topics, hidden within data. Among existing topic model techniques, Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) [11] and its extensions have been successfully applied to many data types and
application domains, including bioinformatics, computer vision, and social network analysis, in
addition to text mining and analytics [12].

The proposed architecture performs two main tasks: (1) applying LDA to identify underlying
topics of a given text block, and (2) ranking candidate vocabularies considering their relevance to
the topics. In detail, we rely on the original version of LDA [11] based on two hyperparameters
𝛼 (controlling the prior distribution over topic weights in each document) and 𝛽 (setting the
prior distribution over word weights in each topic), respectively set to 0.1 and 0.01. Each
topic word bag resulting from applying LDA is then used to build a SPARQL query aiming
at extracting candidate vocabularies. Typically, the words are given to the SPARQL endpoint

taking advantage of the VALUES variable passing method as presented schematically below:

SELECT ?word ?voc WHERE {

VALUES ?word { "word1" "word2" "word3" } # Word list from an LDA bag.
?voc a lod:Vocabulary . ?voc dcterms:description ?description . [...]
FILTER ( CONTAINS ( STR(?description),?word ) )

}

The rest of the query then returns candidate vocabularies ?voc if occurrences of ?word are
present within the vocabulary description, making the assumption that specific words would
be present to describe more generic vocabularies.

Once candidate vocabularies are obtained. We apply the following metric to give each vocabu-
lary a score of relevancy. Formally, considering 𝑘 topics, we have for each topic 𝑡 a bag containing
𝑛𝑡 words and their associated weights i.e. {(𝑤𝑖,𝑡, 𝑝𝑖,𝑡}𝑡, with 𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛𝑡] and 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑘]. As there
might be multiple possible candidate vocabularies for a single word, we obtained (after running
the 𝑘 SPARQL queries) 𝑘 lists containing 𝑐𝑡 3-tuples of the form (𝑣𝑜𝑐𝑗, 𝑤𝑖,𝑡, 𝑝𝑖,𝑡), with 𝑗 ∈
[1, 𝑐𝑡], 𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑛𝑡] and 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑘]. Moreover, a specific vocabulary can be suggested multiple
times for a single topic e.g. a vocabulary about travel may be returned two times considering
the bag {“plane”,“trip”}. To rank the list, we propose to first attribute an aggregated weight for
each vocabulary per topic, summing the weights of the words it matches while normalising
by the sum of the weights in the 3-tuple list for the considered topic; and then to combine the
topics summing the aggregated weights of same vocabularies together:

∀𝑉 ∈ 𝑣𝑜𝑐𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡, 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑉 ) =

𝑘
∑︁

𝑡=1

𝑝𝑖,𝑡

∑︀
𝑣𝑜𝑐𝑖=𝑉
𝑐𝑡∑︀
𝑖=1

𝑝𝑖,𝑡

, considering 𝑘 lists of 𝑐𝑡 3-tuples

We then just have to decreasingly sort the 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 of each vocabulary of 𝑣𝑜𝑐𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡 to provide an
ordered list of suggestions.

The graphical user interface takes as input a text block split by line and allows to select the
number of topics to be identified, ranging from 2 to 10. By clicking on the Analyse button, word
clouds are generated corresponding to detected topics, graphically the larger a word, the more
weight it has in the topic. In parallel, a ranking list of candidate vocabularies is displayed by
descending order of relevancy (using the scoring function aforementioned) including among
other information: the link to the vocabulary, its description and various explanations to describe
the internal step of the process. In particular, it provides information referring to the distribution
of words over topics after applying the scoring metric. Figure 1 presents our pure JavaScript
Web-App: LOV-ES.

3. Related Work

Most of existing works focusing on the task of ontology research relies on the content of
ontology and user query to perform vocabulary recommendation [13]. In these works, the core
idea consists of using a set of keywords or ontology metadata to describe the domain to suggest

appropriate ontology according to the user query. Swoogle 3, Sindice.com 4 or Watson 5 are
semantic search engines performing a search of ontology resources using the aforementioned
methodology. Among proposed works, some of them have especially focused on the LOV
ecosystem. Initially consisting of a full-text inverted index and a ranking algorithm based
on the term popularity [10], related works have extended the recommendation capabilities of
the LOV search engine proposing ranking metrics [14, 15, 16] and evaluation parameters [17].
Recently, Sarwar et al. [18] have addressed the task as an information retrieval problem, intro-
ducing a framework-based on text categorisation and unsupervised learning techniques. To
overcome the well-known limitations related to domain coverage and keyword-based search-
ing/matching, LOV-ES benefits from NLP-powered techniques allowing it to consider full text
data to performing ontology resource recommendation.

4. Conclusion

This article presents LOV-ES: a solution combining an LDA-based model together with a novel
scoring metric to extract relevant vocabularies from the LOV catalog in order to structure a
text. A pure JavaScript Web-App is openly available from:

https://dgraux.github.io/LOV-ES/
with the aim of guiding data practitioners selecting relevant vocabularies to structure textual
knowledge. Currently working exclusively with resources released on LOV, it constitutes the
main limitation of the proposed solution. In future work, we plan to extend the coverage
of available vocabularies by aggregating resources from other catalogs. In addition, several
approaches for estimating LDA parameters have been proposed in the literature and should be
considered in an improved version of LOV-ES, together with an evaluation of the results.
