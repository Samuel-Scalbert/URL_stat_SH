Abstract. We present an approach to semantically annotate the paragraphs of the ancient zoo-
logical text Naturalis Historia (Pliny the Elder) according to the concepts in the domain thesaurus
TheZoo.

Key words. Ancient Zoology, Semantic Classification, Thesaurus.

Introduction

This work is conducted in the context of the Zoomathia international research network studying
the constitution and transmission of zoological knowledge from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. We
combine methods from natural language processing, knowledge representation and machine learn-
ing to classify and automate the semantic annotation of ancient texts using the TheZoo thesaurus
[Leyra et al., 2015]. We address the following research questions:

(i) What is the best vector representation of concepts and paragraphs that we can use as input
for a classifier? (ii) What is the impact of taking into account the semantics captured by a thesaurus
in the vector representations of concepts?

2 Proposed approach

We consider two approaches to automatically classify paragraphs of Pliny’s Naturalis Historia on
ancient zoology into one or more macro collections of concepts (i.e. "Places", "Anthroponym",
etc.) from the TheZoo thesaurus: (i) The baseline method consists into training a Support Vector
Machine for each collection separately. In more detail, for a given collection, a binary classifier is
trained to label a paragraph with a 1 if one concepts from the collection appears in, 0 otherwise.
Each paragraph is represented as a vector of 512 dimensions generated by the Universal Sentence
(ii) The knowledge-based method extends the baseline by
Encoder (USE) [Cer et al., 2018].
using the hierarchical information extracted from the thesaurus. First, we compute the embedded
vectors of each concept under the top concept of each collection. Second, we obtain the centroid of
each hierarchical group based on the embedded vectors [Tounsi Dhouib et al., 2021]. Finally, we
compute the cosine similarity between the vectors representing each centroid and each paragraph.

As a result, each paragraph is represented by a vector of its cosine similarities with respect to the
centroids of each group of concepts. We use these similarities to train a classifier.

3 Experiments and results

We evaluated the performance of our approach on the books 8 to 11 of Pliny’s Naturalis Historia.
These four books are divided into paragraphs, which are manually annotated by linguists with
concepts from TheZoo. We count 765 paragraphs annotated with 10 collections from TheZoo.
Since our dataset is not balanced for all the collections, we used oversampling methods to balance
it, and we applied the train-test split procedure with 80% for train and 20% for validation/test. In
order to evaluate the performance of the proposed settings, we reported the precision (P), recall (R)
and F1 score.

Tab. 1: Classification methods performance.

Based on the F1 score, we see that our domain Knowledge-based approach outperforms the

baseline for some collections such as Place, Zoological information, Zoonym.
