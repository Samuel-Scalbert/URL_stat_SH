Abstract

Coffee is a beverage enjoyed by millions of people worldwide and an important com-
modity for millions of people. Beside the two cultivated species (Coffea arabica and
Coffea canephora), the 139 wild coffee species/taxa belonging to the Coffea genus are
largely unknown to coffee scientists and breeders although these species may be crucial
for future coffee crop development to face climate changes. Here we present the Wild
Coffee Species database (WCSdb) hosted by Pl@ntNet platform (http://publish.plantnet-
project.org/project/wildcofdb_en), providing information for 141 coffee species/taxa,
for which 84 contain a photo gallery and 82 contain sequencing data (genotyping-by-
sequencing, chloroplast or whole genome sequences). The objective of this database
is to better understand and characterize the species (identification, morphology, bio-
chemical compounds, genetic diversity and sequence data) in order to better protect
and promote them.

Introduction

Coffee is a beverage enjoyed by millions of people world-
wide.
It is also an important commodity for millions
of small coffee farmers living in tropical countries. Two
species are mainly cultivated Arabica (Coffea arabica)

and Robusta (Coffea canephora). Coffee fields are deeply
impacted by climate change and the emergence of diseases
(1). Beside cultivated coffee trees, numerous wild coffee
species are known to botanists, but largely ignored by
agronomists and breeders although these species may be

diversity is not comprehensively reported so far in any
publication or any publicly available database.

Based on morphological data, the phylogenetically clos-
est genus called Psilanthus (2) has been recently placed
into Coffea (3). The genus Coffea (broad sense since (3))
includes woody plants belonging to the Rubiaceae family.
It comprises 124 species and 17 additional taxa, with a
natural distribution covering tropical Africa, Madagascar,
Comoros, Mauritius and the Reunion Islands extending to
Southern and Southeast Asia and Australasia. However,
the two genera mainly differ by the flower morphology
with short corolla tube and reproductive organs exerted for
Coffea, long corolla tube and reproductive organs inserted
for Psilanthus. They differ also by their natural distri-
bution. The genus Psilanthus is present on the African
continent, Asia (India, Sri Lanka, tropical and Southeast
Asia) and Oceania (Northern Australia) but absent from the
islands of the West Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mascarenes
and Comoros). The merging of these two genera introduced
a possible source of name confusion as numerous works
are focused only on Coffea sensu stricto. Another source of
species name confusion is the presence of numerous past or
modern synonymies. For example, it is generally accepted
that Psilanthus minor is in fact P. sapinii or that Coffea
vaughanii is C. myrtifolia.

Anyway, these 141 identified and classified species/taxa
are currently considered for further phylogenetic and
molecular analyses (4).

Fourteen years ago, Davis and co-workers (5) revealed
that numerous wild coffee species are vulnerable (23
species), endangered (30 species) or seriously threatened
(19 species). A recent reassessment (1) confirmed that 60%
of them are now threatened with extinction, suggesting a
bad prospect for wild coffee species all over the tropical
world. Wild coffee species living collections were initiated
in the years 1960 in Africa and Madagascar. Today only
55% of them are in such collections: at the research sta-
tion of the Centre National de Recherche en Agronomie,
Divo, Côte d’Ivoire (for African species), at the Centre
de Ressources Biologiques (CRB) Bassin-Martin, Reunion
for
island (http://florilege.arcad-project.org/fr/crb/coffea;
African, Comorian and Mascarene species; Supplemental
data 1) and at the research station of the National Cen-
tre for Applied Research for Rural Development (FOFIFA)
in Kianjavato, Madagascar (for Madagascan species; Sup-
plemental data 2). The analysis of wild coffee species
conserved in living collection revealed large morphologi-
cal variation such as flower morphology, size and color
of fruits, plant height and leaf morphologies, days to
fruit maturation and growth habitats and adaptation. In
addition to morphology,
large variations were observed
in terms of seed biochemical compounds involved in the
quality of coffee such as caffeine (6), trigonelline, sucrose
and mangiferin contents into others (7–9). However, this

The first Coffea genome has been published in 2014
and concerned Coffea canephora (10). Since this first
release,
several sequencing data have been published
such as the genotyping-by-sequencing data to provide
the first resolved phylogeny of the Coffea genus (11),
the partial sequencing of 16 Coffea species (12) and the
chloroplast reconstructions and nuclear SNP mining (13).
Now the Genus is subjected to intensive genome sequencing
(C. arabica, C. eugenioides and C. canephora (14); 82
wild coffee species, unpublished results; Supplemental data
3), allowing research of genes of agronomical interest and
genome composition and evolution studies.

To intensify the protection and the conservation of
wild coffee species and to promote their use in the search
of agronomic genes of interest, more shared information
is needed. So far, few databases are dedicated to wild
coffee species. The Global Biodiversity Information Facil-
ity (GBIF, https://www.gbif.org/species/2895315) includes
8462 occurrences with images for 176 species. How-
ever, the reported samples include those collected in their
natural area and also, those introduced by humans out-
side their natural distribution and those collected from
ex situ living collections. The Reunion_Coffea database
hosted in GBIF database was published by INRA Antilles-
Guyane (15, https://www.gbif.org/dataset/510b8030-6293
-4bd9-812d-c195a9915a74). This database provides the
taxonomic distribution of occurrences (number of acces-
sions per species), date of setting up in Reunion but
does not include pictures or associated Supplementary
data. Other databases are only focused on genomic data,
such as the coffee Genome hub (http://coffee-genome.
org; Robusta genome only),
the TropGeneDB (http:
//tropgenedb.cirad.fr/tropgene/JSP/interface.jsp?module=
COFFEE, mainly genetic markers) and the SOL Genomics
Network https://sgn.cornell.edu/search/organisms).

In this study, we developed a wild coffee species
database (WCSdb), hosted by Pl@ntNet (http://publish.
plantnet-project.org/project/wildcofdb_en). The general
objective of this database is to better understand the
species (identification, morphology, biochemical com-
pounds, genetic diversity and sequence data) in order to
better protect and promote them. More specifically, the
database presents: (i) each species held in collection on
the sites of Bassin-Martin, Reunion Island and Kianjavato,
Madagascar with a photo gallery of the tree morphology
with a total of 597 images; (ii) different detailed infor-
mation such as synonymy, natural distributions, habitats,
architectural, morphological, phenological, biochemistry
traits, genetic/genomic data, trait of interest retrieved from
the literature and personal observations on living collec-
tion and (iii) a general geographical map of the species
distribution.

levels. It is based on Symfony (PHP) and MongoDB and
allows its users to manage data publication spaces: descrip-
tive texts, search forms, taxonomic data, visual data, geo-
graphic data, etc. (Figure 1). Data can be uploaded via
comma-separated values (CSV) files and are then available
through responsive Web pages dedicated to the portal cre-
ated by users. Data exploration is also possible via a
RESTful Web services (JSON). Pl@ntNet Publish was ini-
tially developed in 2014, with the support of Agropolis
Fondation and has been adapted to various cases stud-
ies, such as Herbarium collections, Regional taxonomic
checklists, information for Weed and Invasive species man-
agement,
into others. Pl@ntNet Publish was deposited
in 2015 at the Agency for the Protection of Programs
(IDDN.FR.001.320007.OOO.R.C.2015.000.31235).

The main tab or species tab shows information for 124
accepted species and 17 taxa (Figure 2). Three species has
duplicated entries, according to their distribution or vari-
ety: C. mauritiana for populations from Mauritius and
Reunion islands, for Coffea liberica (variety liberica and
variety dewevrei), and for Psilanthus bengalensis (variety
bababudanii and variety bengalensis). In the species tab,
we decide to keep the nomenclature Coffea and Psilan-
thus for the species to avoid any confusion. This database
also shows species according to their botanical section or
geographic origin: Eucoffea, Mascarocoffea, Mascarenes,
Baracoffea (Madagascan species endemic to the western
coast), Psilanthus from Africa and Psilanthus from Asia.
The species table allows the user to select the species to
examine. In total, for each species, 30 data fields were

completed into a detailed table such as species name, sec-
tion, living collection, synonymy and reference, distribu-
tion, habitat, caffeine content in bean and leaves, sucrose,
mangiferin, ripening time and color of mature fruits, foliar
dimension, genome sizes, sequencing data, and plastid
genomes into others (Figure 3). The fields are described in
the web site (section ‘How to use this site’). The detailed
table contains also references and the links to access to
the molecular data when available (GBS data, nuclear
genome sequences, plastid genomes and raw sequencing
data).

In total, 201 localization entries were linked with coffee
species, representative approximate area where the species
were found when collected in the wild (mainly between
years 1960 and 1980). With the detailed table, a photo
gallery is available for 84 species. The photographs depict
the morphology of beans, leaves, mature fruits, flowers,
and the overall tree, allowing a better identification. In
total, 551 photographs are available.

Conclusions and prospects

The WCS database represents the first comprehensive infor-
mation about wild coffees species, largely unknown to cof-
fee scientists and breeders. The information collected from
the literature and from living collections at Kianjavato,
Madagascar and Bassin-martin, La Réunion, may help
researchers working in the preservation of coffee species,
geneticists and breeders working with trait or genes of
interest and improvement of cultivated species (tolerance
to drought, resistances to diseases and pest, increase the
quality of beans) or breeders motivated to re-cultivate for-
gotten species adapted to climate changes or adapted to
specific habitats. More information will be integrated into
the WCS database in the future, such as the availability of
raw genomic sequences and assembled genome sequences,
new characterized species, and new photo gallery.
