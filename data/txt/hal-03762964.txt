HAL is a multi-disciplinary open access
archive for the deposit and dissemination of sci-
entific research documents, whether they are pub-
lished or not. The documents may come from
teaching and research institutions in France or
abroad, or from public or private research centers.

L’archive ouverte pluridisciplinaire HAL, est
destinée au dépôt et à la diffusion de documents
scientifiques de niveau recherche, publiés ou non,
émanant des établissements d’enseignement et de
recherche français ou étrangers, des laboratoires
publics ou privés.

Abstract

through pre-publication repositories (e.g., arxiv.org), such that

In recent years, several evolutions have drastically transformed the way researchers as
well as scientific and technical information (STI) services interact with scientific literature.
The   amount   and   pace   of   publications   are   skyrocketing,   whether   in   journals   and

increasingly difficult to keep up, find and make sense of relevant articles. Furthermore, the
specialization   of   research   communities   makes   it   difficult   to   discover   cross-disciplinary
knowledge,   which   is   essential   to   meet   the   growing   demand   of   funding   agencies   for
interdisciplinary projects. Scientific open archives are central in this landscape, however
the keyword-based search services that they usually provide fail to grasp the semantic
relationships between articles. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new tools that allow
users to find their way in this mass of knowledge.

provide   a   generic,   transferable   and   extensible   pipeline   for   the   analysis   and
processing of the articles of an open scientific archive;
turn the processing results into a semantic index stored and published as a public
RDF knowledge graph;
develop innovative search and visualization services that leverage this semantic
index   to   allow   researchers,   decision   makers   or   STI   professionals   to   explore
thematic association rules, networks of co-publications, articles with co-occurring
topics, etc. 

The semantic index construction process involves several artificial intelligence techniques:
natural   language   processing,   knowledge   engineering   and   Semantic   Web.   These
techniques are used to process the publications’ metadata and text to automatically extract
thematic descriptors and named entities. These descriptors and named entities are linked
to   knowledge   bases   such   as   Wikidata,   DBpedia  and   GeoNames,   or   domain-specific
terminological resources suited to the archive's domain. The semantic index linked with the
third-party resources serves as a keystone to support the development of rich search and
visualization tools aimed at researchers and/or STI professionals.

We   demonstrated   the   effectiveness   of   this   solution   in   the   use   case   of   Agritrop,   an
institutional archive of 110,000+ resources among which are 12,000 open access articles,
specialized in the fields of agronomy,  biodiversity  and  sustainable  development.   In  this
context,   the   Agrovoc  multilingual   thesaurus   was   used   as   a   domain-specific   reference
vocabulary. Fig. 1 illustrates how the concepts mentioned in the articles of the archive can
be used to discover and visualize association rules. In this example, articles mentioning
concepts COVID-19 and food security (a) frequently mention concept pandemics (b). Fig. 2
shows   how   other   visualization   techniques   can   help   users   search   articles   mentioning
concept health or any of its sub-concepts (a and b), discover that it is often co-mentioned
with climate change (c), and get the list of related publications (d) and their time distribution
(e).

Being   designed   as   a   generic,   transferable   solution,   the   pipeline   and   visualization   tools
delivered   by   ISSA   could   be   easily   adapted   to   open   archives   of   biodiversity   literature.
Typically,   terminological   references   such   as   Darwin   Core   Terms,   Access   to   Biological
Collection   Data  (ABCD),   open   Digital   Specimens  (openDS),   Audubon   Core   Metadata
Schema as well as various taxonomic registries, could be considered for the description of
an article's metadata or the linking of thematic descriptors and named entities. From there,
the proposed visualization techniques could easily be reconfigured to explore the articles
from a biodiversity open archive to answer various competency questions, for instance:
what are the articles that mention a taxon or any of its child taxa? What are the museums/
institutions that are more frequently mentioned together with certain taxonomic groups?
What are the research topics that frequently co-occur with climate change, and how do
these topics evolve through the years? What public policies frequently occur in articles that
mention endangered species? Furthermore, the pipeline could be extended by including
existing third-party tools to carry out e.g., the extraction of relationships between entities or
the reconciliation of authors' names.
