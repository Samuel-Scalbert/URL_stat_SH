ABSTRACT
Agents have been used for simulating cultural evolution and cul-
tural evolution can be used as a model for artificial agents. Previous
results have shown that horizontal, or intra-generation, knowledge
transmission allows agents to improve the quality of their knowl-
edge to a certain level. Moreover, variation generated through ver-
tical, or inter-generation, transmission allows agents to exceed that
level. Such results were obtained under specific conditions such as
the drastic selection of agents allowed to transmit their knowledge,
seeding the process with correct knowledge or introducing artifi-
cial noise during transmission. Here, we question the necessity of
such measures and study their impact on the quality of transmitted
knowledge. For that purpose, we combine the settings of two previ-
ous experiments and relax these conditions (no strong selection of
teachers, no fully correct seed, no introduction of artificial noise).
The rationale is that if interactions lead agents to improve their
overall knowledge quality, this should be sufficient to ensure correct
knowledge transmission, and that transmission mechanisms are
sufficiently imperfect to produce variation. In this setting, we con-
firm that vertical transmission improves on horizontal transmission
even without drastic selection and oriented learning. We also show
that horizontal transmission is able to compensate for the lack of
parent selection if it is maintained for long enough. This means that
it is not necessary to take the most successful agents as teachers,
neither in vertical nor horizontal transmission, to cumulatively
improve knowledge.

1 INTRODUCTION
In cultural evolution [13, 22], concepts from biological evolution
are applied to the culture of a society. This has been explored
experimentally through multi-agent systems to evolve an agent
population’s behaviour [6, 14], language [24] or knowledge [15]
as their culture. The evolution of culture relies on its ability to
display variations that can be selected and transmitted. Early work
has identified different cultural transmission modes inspired by

epidemiology [11, 13]: vertical transmission is the transmission
from parents to children, oblique transmission is the transmission
from agents of the previous generation (think about education)
to those of the next generation, and horizontal transmission is the
transmission between agents of the same generation. Here, we
will also use inter-generation transmission for the two former and
intra-generation transmission for the latter.

Multi-agent work in which agents adapt to interactions among
themselves [24] can be considered as intra-generation transmission.
This has proven to be efficient for reaching consensus and for
sharing culture. Recently, it has been shown that agents that adapt
their knowledge about the environment, expressed as ontologies,
through social interactions in order to reach agreement are able
to improve their ontology accuracy without necessarily adopting
the same ontology [10]. Thus, horizontal transmission is able to
improve knowledge in a society of agents.

Vertical transmission, by transmitting culture from one gener-
ation of agents to another, may be seen as the occasion to shuffle
the cards. It can introduce more variation or enforce (select) a
dominant culture. This calls for assessing the respective roles of
inter-generation and intra-generation transmission.

Another line of work considered exactly this and showed that
inter-generation transmission allows agents to improve knowledge
beyond what intra-generation transmission alone does [14]. In con-
trast, by disabling inter-generation transmission, agents have to
start improving knowledge from scratch at each generation. In a
similar setting, it was also found that intra-generation transmis-
sion generates variation and that inter-generation transmission
performs selection [2].

However, both works rely on strong conditions to ensure the
faithful transmission of correct knowledge (using only the best part
of the population as teachers, initialising agent ontologies from
correct samples) or variation (adding noise in the learning process).
Here, we consider relaxing these assumptions to study the effects
of horizontal and vertical culture transmission without selecting
the best-performing agents and without starting with correct hints.
This is achieved by offering a wider, yet differential, opportunity
to breed and propagate knowledge to the whole agent society and
by starting with random knowledge. This may eventually provide
enough variation in the system.

To test this, we designed a new experimental framework building
on these previous works. We performed experiments with inter-
generation transmission through teaching [2] and intra-generation
transmission through interacting [10], varying the extent of both

transmission modalities and mating policies. We confirm the re-
sults of previous studies under these relaxed assumptions: inter-
generation transmission increases the accuracy of knowledge ob-
tained from intra-generation transmission. Moreover, we show that
even if inter-generation transmission does not select the fittest
parents, intra-generation transmission, if given enough time, can
compensate for this, i.e. agents finally agree to select relevant pieces
of knowledge.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in Section 2,
the related work is reviewed and more details on the two initial
experiments are provided. Section 3 discusses the limitations of
current settings and offers solutions to overcome them. Their actual
implementation is precisely detailed in Section 4. Section 5 presents
the performed experiments and Section 6 provides their results
which are discussed in Section 7.

2 RELATED WORK
We first present work related to agents and cultural evolution gen-
erally before considering more precisely two experiments on which
this work is based.

2.1 Agents and Cultural Evolution
Interactions between agents can serve as a mean of adaptation.
Many approaches exploit them in multi-agent systems, for in-
stance, to improve interoperability [5, 25] or observe emergent
behaviours [19]. In some cases, by interacting with each other,
agents may end up sharing and evolving a particular culture, e.g.
knowledge about the environment, ways to interact, norms or con-
ventions [16, 23]. This is typically studied by observing a population
of agents that interact with each other through a well-defined pro-
tocol. The state of the system is monitored until agents reach a
stable state in which their culture does not change any more. The
characteristics of this culture are then assessed [24].

In this work, we are interested in the evolution of knowledge
that agents use to behave. Cultural evolution has been applied
to knowledge in the form of ontology alignments [3, 15]. It has
also been applied to ontologies [10] in which agents adapt their
concept definitions to agree with each other. They improved their
knowledge about the environment without necessarily sharing
the same ontology. Agents in this setting learn from others by
interacting with them, which is known as social learning [18, 20].
However, when the agents reach a full agreement, they stop
adapting their knowledge. In a sense, they reach a local optimum
with respect to the accuracy of their knowledge. Escaping this state
may be obtained by either changing the environment or the agents.
Evolving different agent generations has been considered in
evolutionary multi-agent systems [12] in which agents are able to
reproduce and may die. Although agents could be thought of as
developing a culture, this has not been studied from that perspective.
Introducing cultural mechanisms within agents has been developed
in cultural algorithms [21]. However, this work has been mainly
applied to optimisation problems.

It has been shown that culture transmission allows the dis-
covery of behaviours that are inaccessible to genetic evolution
[7, 17]. Multi-agent simulation of cultural evolution involving intra-
generation and inter-generation transmission has been investigated

in a series of experiments [2, 4, 6, 14]. Based on neural networks for
embodying knowledge, they implement connection weight com-
munication [6], supervised learning (imitation) [2, 14] or direct
instruction [4] as a vertical transmission mechanism. Using the
same imitation mechanism for horizontal transmission [2], it was
shown that the intra-generation culture transmission provided the
variation that allowed the evolutionary process to be more effective
than what it is with inter-generation transmission alone. This work
is however based on a drastic selection of teachers from whom
agents learn, both in oblique and horizontal transmission.

Below, we discuss more lengthly the experiments developed in

[2] and [10] on which we will build.

2.2 Inter-Generation Culture Inheritance
Acerbi and Parisi [2] designed an experiment in which agents use
a neural network to navigate in their environment. The lifetime
of agents spans 10 epochs of 50 games. At each game, the agent
is presented with a situation and decides how to move. When it
comes close to an edible food source, it receives a reward and when
it comes close to a poisonous food source, it receives a penalty. In
addition, a teacher discloses its decision to the agent, that it uses
to adjust its network weights. This operation is repeated over 500
generations of 100 agents all replaced at once.

At birth, agents start with random weighted networks (𝑊 ). The
first 6 epochs of their lifetime are dedicated to oblique transmission:
they are taught their behaviour by agents of the previous generation.
The next 4 epochs implements horizontal transmission: they are
taught by agents from their generation (Figure 1, left). One key
point is that in both cases they are only taught by the best 5%
agents in terms of accumulated rewards. Teaching is achieved by
constraining the output of the neural network. Teachers may add
noise in their behaviour in order to generate variation.

Experiments are reported with oblique transmission only, hori-
zontal transmission only, or both. In particular, results show that
oblique transmission alone allows agents to improve (as measured
by collected rewards) over generations, though horizontal transmis-
sion does not, because agents learn from novice agents. They also
show that the introduction of noise is key to speed up improvement,
and that horizontal transmission can provide it.

In these experiments, the selection of the 5% best performing
agents in both transmission modes (20% for [14]) is a very strong
bias because it gives little opportunity to general individuals to
reproduce. This does not happen in human societies.

2.3 Intra-Generation Social Learning
Bourahla and colleagues [10] designed an experiment in which
agents live in an environment populated by objects identified by
their features, e.g. ‘can move’ or ‘has fangs’, for which they have
to make decisions, e.g. ‘hunt’ or ‘hide’. Agents’ goal is to agree
with other agents on the decision to make. They follow a two-step
experiment protocol (Figure 1, right). First, agents learn to make
decisions about objects of their environments from a set of samples
(𝑆). The output of this step is, in particular, a simple ontology (𝑂)
allowing to classify objects and to determine the decision to make.
Then, agents repetitively interact with each other two-by-two. They
compare the decisions that they would make about objects. The

is to the extent that [2] introduces artificial noise in the model in
order to increase variation.

We conjecture that a less restricted opportunity to transmit
knowledge, both across and within generations, provides enough
variation to improve over horizontal transmission.

3.2 Combining the Two Experiments
Although the two experiments described above are about knowl-
edge transmission, they differ on many notable features, such as:

oblique and horizontal transmission vs. horizontal transmis-
sion;
neural networks vs. ontologies and decision trees;
selecting teachers vs. random interaction;
positive and negative reward vs. agreement.

•

•
•
•

Some of these differences are secondary, such as the choice of the
representation, though others are more important, such as those
affecting transmission modalities.

To test our conjecture, we combine both approaches of Figure 1
and relax these unwanted constraints. The resulting setting, as
shown in Figure 2, is such that:

intra-generation transmission is implemented by interac-

tion exactly as in [10].

inter-generation transmission is implemented through learn-
ing. As in [2], a generation of agents is replaced by another
generation. Instead of implementing oblique transmission,
agents reproduce differentially with respect to a probability
distribution and transmit their knowledge to their children.
However, they do it with the modalities of [10].

This should allow us to determine under which conditions agents
can improve generation after generation, or if they reproduce their
knowledge, thus behaviour, identically.

3.3 Relaxing Elitist Assumptions
For relaxing selection, the reproduction phase is implemented by
parents having children. The probability to have children will be
determined either equiprobably or relative to the income of the
agents (denoting their success).

Important changes concern vertical transmission. It is split into
two steps: (a) the acquisition of an initial ontology by the chil-
dren, and (b) the transmission of knowledge from the parents by
first interacting predominantly with them and then progressively
widening their interactions.

The initial ontology may either be empty, be random, be a merge
of the parents’ ontologies or be learned as in the first step above,
from samples provided by the parents (Figure 2). Here, agents either
start with random ontologies (suppressing the learning phase) or
learn their ontologies under the supervision of their parents which
provide the samples from which to learn.

This setting ensures a wide opportunity for agents to have chil-
dren to which to transmit their knowledge. Moreover, the sample
from which children learn may now be incorrect (because parents
do not have fully correct knowledge and because samples are pro-
vided by both parents) and incomplete (because they do not cover
the whole object space). They thus relax the first two identified
limitations.

Figure 1: Experimental frameworks of [2] (left) and [10]
(right). (𝑊 =neural networks weights, 𝑆=training sample,
𝑂=ontology). In spite of structural similarities, the mech-
anisms for transmitting knowledge are different: both inter-
generation mechanisms are supervised learning, but intra-
generation transmission is different.

interactions succeed when the agents agree on the decision; they
fail otherwise. In the event of a failure, one of the agents adapts its
ontology in order to adopt the decision of the other on this object.
Experiments showed that agents are able to reach a state in which
they always agree. The quality of their ontologies, as measured by
its accuracy, increases on average, but not in every case, and does
not necessarily reach full accuracy. Finally, though the distance
between agents’ ontologies decreases, agents do not necessarily
end up with the same ontologies.

The success criterion for agents is to agree, not necessarily to
make the correct decision. The correct decision to be made is un-
known to the agents. It is used only in two occasions: (1) initially,
agents are trained with a sample which is correct, but incomplete;
(2) the choice of which agent will adapt its knowledge is based on
rewards that they have received on a (different) sample. Although
(2) is legitimate, (1) is not. Hence, we relax this by using samples
labelled by parents not knowing the correct decision.

3 TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

TO KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION

We first discuss the limitations of the experiments presented be-
fore. Then we propose to combine them in a way addressing these
limitations. This allows us to formulate our claims as hypotheses.

3.1 Limitations
The two experiments described in the last subsections have the
merit to provide a model of cultural transmission in agents and to
show that it has a positive effect on their efficiency. However, they
do it with modalities which seem strong and unnatural:

•

•

starting with correct samples does not correspond to what
happens in real life;
restricting the role of teachers to a very limited part of the
population (5%, 20%) seems to go counter the idea of culture
and its propagation.

Interestingly, these two modalities tend to enforce the faithful trans-
mission of correct/fit culture, though the benefits of vertical trans-
mission are supposed to come from the variation it provides. This

𝑊Teaching𝑊Teaching𝑊Teaching𝑊Teaching𝑊𝑆Learning𝑂Interacting𝑂inter-generationtransmissionintra-generationtransmissionOf course, this setting is not exempt of bias: the most successful
agents, which may not have the most correct knowledge, are more
likely to have children and, during horizontal transmission, success
will also play a role in which agent will learn from which other.
However, this bias still allows a broad fraction of the propulation
to reproduce and transmit knowledge.

Finally, no artificial noise is added to any agent behaviour. As
mentioned above, the ‘egalitarian’ recruitment of parents and the
incorrectness of samples provided by parents are already sources
of variation during vertical transmission. The disconnection be-
tween ontology accuracy (the measure of knowledge quality) and
agreement (the goal pursued by agents) is an additional source of
variation during horizontal transmission.

3.4 Hypotheses
This framework will be used to test our claims experimentally. We
aim at investigating primarily two directions. First, once agents
reach a global agreement, they do not adapt their knowledge any-
more. As shown in [10], they may still agree on incorrect deci-
sions and they preserve the diversity of their knowledge. The inter-
generation transmission should introduce further variation allow-
ing agents to discover new relevant pieces of knowledge. Accord-
ingly, as in [2, 14], we hypothesise that (𝐻1) vertical transmission
allows new generations’ knowledge to be more accurate than that of
the previous generation.

According to [10], agents are able to improve the correctness of
their decisions when they adapt their knowledge to agree with each
other. This suggests that the intra-generation knowledge transmis-
sion is able to select pieces of knowledge to preserve. Thus, we
hypothesise that (𝐻2), interaction, used as intra-generation transmis-
sion, can compensate for the absence of parent selection.

4 EXPERIMENTAL FRAMEWORK
In order to test the two proposed hypotheses, we have designed
an experimental framework following the above principles with
mechanisms for agents to mate, reproduce, die, and to transmit
knowledge from parents to children.

Below we describe the general process (Section 4.1) and detail

what differs from the original experiments:

•
•
•

The agent life cycle (Section 4.2),
How agents are selected to reproduce (Section 4.3),
How agents transmit their knowledge to their children (Sec-
tion 4.4).

Several questions can be raised on how these additions affect agents’
knowledge. In this paper, we focus on the impact of knowledge
transmission on knowledge accuracy.

4.1 Overall Process
In these experiments, we reuse the exact same

environments and ontologies,
ontology learning procedure,
social learning procedure, and
evaluation measures,

as in [10]. The game is played with objects characterised by 4
features on which only one decision is valid among 6 possible ones.

Figure 2: Combination of the mechanisms of Figure 1: hori-
zontal transmission of knowledge is achieved through agents
interacting; initial vertical transmission involves parents
generating samples (𝑆) from their ontologies (𝑂) from which
children will learn their initial ontology (𝑂).

Experiment runs are made of periods split in two parts (Figure 3):

agents of the new generation acquire their initial knowledge;
interaction in which agents use their ontologies to agree on
decisions about objects and modify them in case of disagree-
ment.

The agents of the initial population (generations 0 and 1) are

initialised with random ontologies.

This process is illustrated in Figure 2 and precisely described

below.

4.2 Agent Life Cycle
An agent is born at the beginning of a period and dies at the end
of the next period (it lives for 2 periods). In the first period, the
agent is considered a child. During the second period, the agent
is considered an adult. Between these two periods, agents may
reproduce according to precise modalities explained in Section 4.3.
During the first period of their lives, (child) agents learn from
their parents through inter-generation knowledge transmission
detailed in Section 4.4. They gradually get detached from their
parents and start interacting with other individuals of the society.
During the second period of their lives, some agents have become
parents and transmit their knowledge to their children. They still
interact with the other individuals of the society and may adapt
their knowledge.

At the end of each period,

This means that each generation is composed of
2 agents and that
the whole population is composed of 𝑋 agents (𝑋 being even and
greater than 4).

To keep the number of agents in the population constant, the
initial population is composed of 𝑋 agents. Half of this population,
considered generation 0, dies at the end of the first period and does
not reproduce. The other half, generation 1, behaves like the rest

The transmission process goes through two steps (Figure 3).

Initial vertical transmission. In the first stage, each agent of the
new population acquires knowledge directly from its 𝑣 parents.
Children may have an initial ontology that is empty, random, the
result of merging their parents’ ontologies, or the result of being
taught by their parents. Although all options are possible, we only
experiment with either random ontologies (abusively denoted by
𝑟 = 0) or ontologies learnt from the parents reusing the technique
of [10]. More precisely, 𝑟 % of all objects with distinct properties
(object types) are randomly selected. Each parent labels half of these
objects with the decisions it would make with respect to its own
ontology (which may be incorrect). This set of labelled objects is
presented to the child as a training sample (𝑆) from which it learns
its ontology.

Interactions. Once this initial transmission has been performed,
agents interact with other agents following the protocol of [10]. The
interactions are constrained such that agents are initially biased
towards more interactions with their parents: At its 𝑖𝑡ℎ
iteraction,
each agent has probability 𝑃𝑖 to interact with one of its parents
selected randomly. The probability of restricting the agent inter-
action depends on 𝑖 and the restricted interaction reduction rate
𝜖 < 1. It is determined by:

𝑃𝑖 = max

Thus, the bias is maximal at the first interaction, decreases as inter-
actions increase and has no effect after interaction
. This mimics
agents progressively broadening their social circles. In the experi-
ments, we use 𝜖 = .01. Hence, for each child, this bias disappears
after 100 interactions.

When agents are adult, they can interact with anyone:

their children (vertical transmission),
the children of others (oblique transmission),
other agents of their generation (horizontal transmission).

•
•
•

Given the non-oriented character of transmission, it is possible that
an adult learns knowledge from a child, as this occurs in real life and
contrary to genetic transmission. This learnt piece of knowledge
may even be transmitted to future generations if it goes again to
the next generation through vertical or oblique transmission.

Agents adapt their ontologies with an operator (split) which
splits a concept in two according to the description of the object
for which both agents do not agree [10].

5 EXPERIMENTS
We perform two experiments to test each of the hypotheses intro-
duced in Section 3.4. They use the same modus operandi, only a
few independent variables differ. Table 1 summarises the parameter
values considered in these experiment plans. Values of 𝜏 end by 1,
in order to compute measures at the 𝜏
1 iteration, i.e. before the
population is replaced. Each combination of parameter values is
run 10 times.

It corresponds to 10% selection. Figure 4 shows these probability dis-
tributions. In the case of the performed experiment, income-based
is very different from maximal and closer to equiprobable.

sion is tested. However, the setting may be interpreted as vertical

Transmission on Ontology Accuracy

As mentioned in Section 2.3, intra-generation transmission con-
verges towards a stable state in which agents always agree on the
same decision. However, this decision may not be the correct one
but, without feedback from the environment, agents have no reason
to know it. Hence the accuracy of their ontology is not maximal.

Typically, this situation may evolve through changing the condi-
tions (adding new agents, modifying the environment). The intro-
duction of new agents, which have to learn their ontologies from
imperfect ones (either starting with a random ontology or learn-
ing from an imperfect and incomplete sample provided by their
genitors), introduces variations in the system.

The first experiment, aims at assessing the effects of introducing
agent generations. Thus, we focus on the variables affecting vertical
knowledge transmission: the proportion of instances covered by
the training sample and the length of population life span, because
it constrains the amount of interactions with parents.

As a consequence, we vary the transmission percentage 𝑟 which
corresponds to how complete and how imperfect the inter-generation
transfer is. When the transmission sample ratio is 0, agents start
with random ontologies. We also vary the length of the period 𝜏
which corresponds to agents’ half-life. When the period length
is greater than the number of iterations (𝜏 > 𝑛), the experiment
happens within one generation (no variation of agent knowledge).
Hypothesis 𝐻1 can thus be rephrased as Adding inter-generation
transmission leads to higher accuracy than intra-generation trans-
mission alone.

5.2 Experiment 2: Interaction Between Selection

and Interaction Length

Selection mechanisms are assumed to provide a reproductive advan-
tage: the most accurate ontologies will provide higher fitness which
itself provides to their bearers the possibility to reproduce more.
Such ontologies may spread more in further generations. Previous
results confirmed this assumption and showed that selection played
an important role in such a spreading (Section 2.2).

In this second experiment, we test the less selective policies. More
specifically, we investigate whether intra-generation transmission,
a typical cultural evolution mechanism, may compensate for the
reduction or absence of parent selection.

This experiment focuses on (1) how parents are selected for
reproduction, and (2) how long an agent generation lives: because
agents need time to agree with each other on which pieces of
knowledge to adopt. Thus, we vary the parent selection policy
𝑠 as 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚, 𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 and 𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 and the period length 𝜏 as in the
first experiment. We also perform the experiment for agents which
do not adapt their knowledge after interaction (𝑜𝑝 = 𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑒), fully
discarding horizontal transmission. To that extent, the adaptation
operator 𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑒 is introduced, the operator 𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡 being that of [10].

Hypothesis 𝐻2 can thus be tested as with sufficient intra-generation
transmission, accuracy obtained with or without selection is similar.

5.3 Ontology Accuracy
For each experiment, we report the ontology accuracy which is used
to test the hypotheses. The accuracy of an ontology is computed as

Figure 5: Average accuracy (over 𝑟 ) by period lengths.

the proportion of object types, i.e. feature combinations, for which
the correct decision is made by the ontology. It is averaged over
the 𝑋 ontologies of all agents at a particular iteration and averaged
over 10 runs. The test of the hypotheses themselves applies to the
final state of the experiment (iteration 𝑛). We display the evolution
of the measure over all iterations.

6 RESULTS
In the following, the results for the two experiments are presented.
For each of them, we first show how the results answer the asso-
ciated hypothesis. Additional details are discussed regarding the
interaction of the different parameters with the results.

To test Hypothesis 𝐻1, we compare the average final accuracy of
experiments with only one generation (𝜏 = 200001) to experiments
with multiple generations (of different period lengths). Figure 5
shows this evolution. By performing an ANOVA (Analysis of Vari-
ance) test, the accuracy at the end of the experiment when inter-
generation transmission occurs at periods of length 10001 and 20001
is different from when it does not occur at all. Post-hoc, tuckey-hsd

significant (𝑝

to a single generation (200001). Thus, Hypothesis 𝐻1 is accepted
with 𝜏
Inter-generation transmission needs long interaction peri-
ods. It can be observed, in the early iterations of Figure 5, that
each generation improves its accuracy over the previous one. In
particular, the accuracy obtained at 2𝜏 is strictly superior to the ac-
curacy at 𝜏. This confirms that agents with vertical transmission are
able to reach a higher accuracy than horizontal transmission alone.
However, when the interaction period is not long enough, agents
do not have time to spread relevant knowledge widely. Hence, ver-
tical transmission suffers from the low accuracy of the transmitted
knowledge and the short period only allows to recover from this.
This explains why, when the period length is 5001, the accuracy
does not improve.
Short interaction periods can be compensated for by larger
transmission percentage. Table 2 shows the final accuracy of
agents per period length and transmission percentage. When the

period length is 5001, the accuracy gets higher as the transmission
percentage gets larger. This is because the shorter the period, the
smaller the transmission achieved by interaction. If the initial train-
ing sample is small, then agents do not receive enough knowledge
from their parents to perpetuate what has been gained during the
previous period.

Complete transmission percentage harms variation in long
interaction periods. In contrast, when the period is long (10001 or
20001), the transmission percentage only affects accuracy when it
is complete (𝑟 = 1.0). Then accuracy is lower. This might be because
faithful transmission reduces variation. As long as there is a small
variation, agents improve. When the transmission percentage is
small, agents compensate for it by transmitting through interaction.
Transmission percentage and period length interact. Figure 6
compares the accuracy of agents with (𝑟 ≠ 0) and without (𝑟 = 0)
initial vertical transmission, under different period lengths (𝜏 =
5001 and 𝜏 = 20001). When the period is short (𝜏 = 5001), a higher
transmission percentage (𝑟 = .8) yields better results than a lower
transmission percentage (𝑟 = 0 and 𝑟 = .2 provide very close final
results). On the contrary, with a long period (𝜏 = 20001), the best
results are obtained without initial vertical transmission (𝑟 = 0),
those with initial vertical transmission being very close to each
other.

This is explained by the capacity of intra-generation transmis-
sion to spread accurate knowledge to the whole population. This
knowledge has a chance to be transmitted even with low 𝑟 and even
in absence of initial vertical transmission (𝑟 = 0) because it can be
transmitted from parents through interaction. In this case, a low
𝑟 provides the variation allowing to further increase accuracy. On
the contrary, if there is not enough intra-generation transmission
(short 𝜏), the perpetuation of knowledge benefits from a more faith-
ful initial vertical transmission. This shows the delicate balance to
be found between 𝑟 and 𝜏 to ensure knowledge improvement.

(blue) initial vertical transmission (blue).

6.2 Intra-Generation Transmission can

Compensate for the Lack of Selection
To test Hypothesis 𝐻2, we first show that the selection of parents
without the intra-generation transmission does actually improve
knowledge accuracy. Then, we show that this effect does not exist
when there is intra-generation transmission. Table 3 summarises
these results. Results reported below are those with 𝜏 = 20001, the
same results are obtained with 5001 and 10001 (20001 provides the
least favourable figures).
Selection is efficient. Figure 7 shows in dashed lines the evolu-
tion of agent accuracy with only the inter-generation transmission
comparing maximal (𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡), income-based (𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒) and equiproba-
ble (𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚) selection policies. In the absence of intra-generation

transmission, having random parents does not improve the accu-
racy over periods, though parent selection improves it. Maximal
selection provides better results than income-based selection. The
ANOVA test on the final accuracy of the three selection methods
results in a significant difference (𝑝
Intra-generation transmission compensates for the lack of
selection. As it can be observed in Figure 7, the evolution of agent
accuracy when there is intra-generation transmission (solid lines),
is significantly higher than when it is not present (dashed lines).
Furthermore, contrary to having inter-generation transmission only,
when the intra-generation transmission is present, the way parents
are selected has little impact on the final accuracy. In the presence
of intra-generation transmission (𝑜𝑝 = 𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑡), ANOVA returns no
significant difference between the three parent selection methods
(𝑝 = 0.34). In this case, Table 4 shows that the difference between
no selection (𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚) and maximal and income-based selection
policies is close to 0, though it is significantly larger without intra-
generation transmission. Thus, we accept Hypothesis 𝐻2: intra-
generation transmission compensates for the lack of selection.

7 DISCUSSION
Such results provide a better understanding of transmission param-
eters which warrant a proper cumulative cultural evolution.

We have shown that the combination of vertical and horizontal
transmission of knowledge over generations of agents improves
knowledge accuracy. This confirms previous results [2, 14] under
broader conditions: initial knowledge is not necessarily correct,
no drastic selection of teachers is applied, no artificial noise is
introduced to boost variation. We have also shown that a very
important factor in the cumulative improvement of knowledge is
the population life span.

Thus this paper can be read as a confirmation, using a different
framework and relaxed constraints, of [2]’s results about the ef-
ficiency of vertical transmission for improving agent knowledge.
It can also be seen as a rebuttal that strong parent selection is an
important factor for observing such effects.

In fact, the wider a culture is shared in a population, the less
important the selection. The obtained results show that spreading
quality knowledge requires time. If agents have a short life span and
no selection, then knowledge will not improve because the fittest
one will have little chance to be passed to the next generation. But
if they have enough time to spread accurate knowledge, then it will
improve over generations without parent selection.

It can be questioned whether evolution without selection is still
evolution. This is the specificity of cultural evolution that, to the
selection of individuals by the environment, is added the selec-
tion of culture by these individuals, occurring during horizontal
transmission. [2] showed that (1) the intra-generation transmission
can introduce variation in culture and (2) its selection occurs in
the inter-generation transmission. Contrary to that, we showed
how (1) inter-generation transmission can be the one introducing
variations (which allow agents to improve further their accuracy
as shown in Section 6.1) and (2) intra-generation transmission can
select the knowledge that spreads in the agent population (Sec-
tion 6.2). Contrary to genes, even if parents do not provide the best
cultural assets, children are able to acquire them from peers or other
sources. These results show the robustness of cultural evolution in
which the two transmission modes can balance each other.

The social import of such results is that it is not necessary to have
a drastic selection of agents for the society’s culture to improve over
generations. The good news is that if we are too ignorant, there
is hope that our children can catch good knowledge. Of course,
there should be a minimal transmission of what is improved for the
evolution to be cumulative. But this is also ensured when efficient
culture is widely spread, as culture should be.
