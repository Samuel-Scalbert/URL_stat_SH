Abstract

Multi-genotype  canopies  are  frequent  in  phenotyping  experiments  and  are  of  increasing  interest  in  agriculture. 
Radiation  interception  efficiency  (RIE)  and  radiation  use  efficiency  (RUE)  have  low  heritabilities  in  such  canopies. 
We propose a revised Monteith equation that identifies environmental and genetic components of RIE and RUE. An 
environmental term, a component of RIE, characterizes the effect of the presence or absence of neighbours on light 
interception. The ability of a given plant to compete with its neighbours is then identified, which accounts for the gen-
etic variability of RIE of plants having similar leaf areas. This method was used in three experiments in a phenotyping 
platform with 765 plants of 255 maize hybrids. As expected, the heritability of the environmental term was near zero, 
whereas that of the competitiveness term increased with phenological stage, resulting in the identification of quanti-
tative trait loci. In the same way, RUE was dissected as an effect of intercepted light and a genetic term. This approach 
was used for predicting the behaviour of individual genotypes in virtual multi-genotype canopies. A large effect of 
competitiveness was observed in multi-genotype but not in single-genotype canopies, resulting in a bias for genotype 
comparisons in breeding fields.

Keywords:   canopy heterogeneity, GWAS, high-throughput phenotyping, inter-genotypic competition, light interception, light 
use efficiency, maize, plant architecture, varietal mixture.

Introduction

Light interception is a main determinant of the genetic variabil-
ity of biomass accumulation, together with photosynthetic rate 
(Zhu et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2012). It is defined and meas-
ured as the proportion of incident light that is intercepted by a 
canopy (radiation interception efficiency; RIE). It is essentially 

linked to leaf area, itself subjected to tight genetic and environ-
mental controls (Tardieu et al., 2014), but plant architecture also 
largely contributes to light interception and plant performance 
as  suggested  by  the  success  of  breeding  programmes  affect-
ing leaf erectness (Mantilla-Perez and Salas Fernandez, 2017).

Leaf  photosynthetic  rate  is  a  second  determinant  of  biomass 
accumulation. It is usually determined based on instantaneous 
measurements at the leaf level that need to be performed on 
several appropriate leaf samples per plant at different times of 
the  day  to  represent  the  spatial  and  temporal  variabilities  of 
photosynthetic activity. This is nearly incompatible with high 
throughput measurements, thereby impeding genetic analyses. 
Hence, it is useful to consider a proxy of it in phenomic stud-
ies.  Radiation  use  efficiency  (RUE),  defined  as  the  dry  can-
opy biomass produced per unit intercepted radiation, presents 
a strong genetic positive correlation with net photosynthetic 
rate at leaf level (Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2016). A major inter-
est of RUE is that it can be estimated for thousands of plants 
in a phenotyping platform, whereas single leaf–atmosphere or 
canopy–atmosphere gas exchange measurements can hardly be 
managed  at  this  spatial  scale  (Koester  et  al.,  2016;  Moualeu-
Ngangue et al., 2017; Stinziano et al., 2017). The relative con-
tributions  of  RIE  and  RUE  to  biomass  accumulation  have 
been synthesized in a widely accepted model (Monteith 1977), 
used since then for physiological dissections of biomass accu-
mulation (Louarn et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2015), for ecological 
studies (Onoda et al., 2014), and for modelling at scales ranging 
from single leaf to regions, for example in analyses of climate 
change  (Asseng  et  al.,  2013;  Martre  et  al.,  2015).  Both  RIE 
and RUE show large genotypic variabilities (Maddonni et al., 
2001;  Moreau  et  al.,  2012;  Cabrera-Bosquet  et  al.,  2016),  so 
it  is  now  essential  to  analyse  their  genetic  architectures  in  a 
range  of  environmental  scenarios  in  order  to  relate  them  to 
biological pathways, as done in studies of other complex traits 
(e.g. flowering time in Buckler et al., 2009; grain yield in Millet 
et  al.,  2016)  and  to  identify  sources  of  genetic  progress  in  a 
changing climate (Lobell et al., 2011; Tardieu et al., 2018).

The model proposed by Monteith (1977) analyses biomass 
accumulation by a crop canopy as a whole, so the contribution 
of individual plants can only be identified if the involved plants 
present similar RUEs and RIEs. This assumption is most often 
acceptable  in  large  fields  involving  one  genotype.  However, 
there is an increasing interest in multi-genotype canopies for 
their  resilience  to  diseases  (Sapoukhina  et  al.,  2013)  or  risk 
minimization  (Tilahun,  1995),  or  in  association  of  bushes  or 
small trees with crops for better use of resources over 1 year 
(Luedeling et al., 2016). Furthermore, many phenotyping activ-
ities are carried out with multi-genotype canopies, for example 
in field experiments in the first steps of plant breeding or in 
most  phenotyping  platforms.  In  addition,  many  agronomical 
experiments or breeding programmes involve small plots sepa-
rated  by  paths,  thereby  introducing  heterogeneous  situations 
among  plants  for  light  interception.  Progress  in  phenotyping 
now allows precise estimation of the individual leaf area and 
spatial arrangement of plants in phenotyping platforms (Alvarez 
Prado et al., 2018), or leaf area index and gap fraction in the 
field (Liu et al., 2017), thereby potentially allowing calculation 
of RIE and RUE at the scale of micro-plots in the field or of 
plants in phenotyping platforms. A methodological challenge 
is  now  to  take  into  account  the  non-homogeneity  of  cano-
pies and the plant-to-plant interactions to identify the genetic 
and  environmental  contributions  to  RIE  and  RUE.  Indeed, 
RIE  and  RUE  are  associated  with  environmental  terms  that 

considerably reduce their heritabilities and therefore the power 
of  their  genetic  analyses.  It  is  noteworthy  that  this  is  already 
the case for RUE in any canopy because of its dependence on 
photosynthetic  photon  flux  density  (PPFD)  (Warren-Wilson 
et al., 1992; Onoda et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014b).

A difficulty for assessing the effect of canopy heterogenei-
ties on light interception is the near-infinite number of cases 
involving a number of genotypes with any spatial arrangement 
(density, orientation, position of paths). Here we propose a two-
step approach for dealing with multi-genotype canopies. First 
we  characterize  the  capability  for  light  interception  of  indi-
vidual plants of each genotype in a phenotyping platform, and 
then analyse RIE and RUE of any virtual canopy that com-
bines  genotypes  and  spatial  arrangements.  High-throughput 
phenotyping  platforms  now  allow  automatic  acquisition  of 
multi-view  images  of  the  plants,  which  can  be  used  to  esti-
mate  leaf  area  and  biomass  of  individual  plants  (Rajendran 
et al., 2009; Hairmansis et al., 2014; Knecht et al., 2016; Tardieu 
et al., 2017; Brichet et al., 2017), and to reconstruct realistic 3D 
architecture  of  plants  (Pound  et  al.,  2014,  McCormick  et  al., 
2016). We have recently proposed an approach that combines 
a 2D modelling of local light intensity in a greenhouse with 
a stochastic 3D model of light interception, which allows one 
to  estimate,  for  each  individual  plant,  the  incident  light  flux 
over the considered plant, the amount of intercepted light and 
RUE  (Cabrera-Bosquet  et  al.,  2016).  However,  this  method 
does not yet explicitly take plant-to-plant variations and inter-
genotypic interactions into account.

We propose here a revision of the Monteith equation that 
dissects RIE and RUE into genetic and environmental com-
ponents. It can be used in heterogeneous canopies in a phe-
notyping  platform,  and  allows  simulating  light  interception 
and biomass accumulation of multi-genotype, non-continuous 
canopies in the field. Using this method, we have first explored 
the genetic variabilities of the terms that underline RIE and 
RUE in 255 maize hybrids, resulting in an increase in herit-
ability and quality of quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection, 
compared with the direct estimates of RIE and RUE by the 
Monteith model. We have then simulated virtual multi-geno-
type canopies to test the extent to which the canopy hetero-
geneity affects biomass production of individual genotypes.

Materials and methods

Plant material and experimental conditions
A  maize  hybrid  population  was  generated  by  crossing  a  common  flint 
parent  (UH007)  with  255  dent  lines  presenting  a  restricted  flowering 
window. Details can be found in Millet et al. (2016). Three experiments 
were  conducted,  in  winter  2013,  spring  2013,  and  spring  2016,  in  the 
PhenoArch phenotyping platform (Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2016) hosted 
at  the  M3P,  Montpellier  Plant  Phenotyping  Platforms  (https://www6.
montpellier.inra.fr/lepse/M3P). Plants were grown in polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) 9 litre pots (0.19 m diameter, 0.4 m high) filled with a 30:70 (v/v) 
mixture of a clay and organic compost. Soil water content in pots was 
maintained at target values by daily watering of each pot using water-
ing stations made up of weighting terminals with 1 g accuracy (ST-Ex, 
Bizerba, Balingen, Germany) and high-precision pump-watering stations 
(520U, Watson Marlow, Wilmington, MA, USA). A randomized complete 
block  design  was  used  where  each  hybrid  was  replicated  three  times. 
Within  the  platform,  air  temperature  and  humidity  were  measured  at

six  positions  every  15  min  (HMP45C, Vaisala  Oy,  Helsinki,  Finland). 
Greenhouse temperature was maintained at 26 ± 3 °C during the light 
period and 18 ± 1 °C during the night. Supplemental light was provided 
during the daytime when external solar irradiation dropped below 300 
W m−2 and during the night to extend the photoperiod with 400 W HPS 
Plantastar  lamps  (Osram,  Munich,  Germany)  with  0.4  lamps  m−2. The 
resulting  daily  photoperiod  was  12  h. Time  corrected  for  temperature 
(thermal time) was expressed in equivalent days at 20 °C (d20°C, Parent 
and Tardieu, 2012). Full details of experimental and environmental condi-
tions are described in Alvarez Prado et al. (2018).

angle distribution of the canopy was calculated as the mean of angles of 
all  triangles  of  the  3D  mesh. The  amount  of  light  intercepted  by  each 
cell was calculated every day by dividing the daily photon flux integral 
above the greenhouse (mol m−2 d−1) into 46 beam angles using a sky radi-
ance distribution model, and computing the beam extinction through the 
grid. The amount of light intercepted by each plant, Rplant, was obtained 
by summing the radiation intercepted by each cell occupied by the plant, 
weighted by the relative contribution of the considered plant to the cell 
area and multiplied by the light transmission at the corresponding x–y 
position in the platform (Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2016).

Estimating plant leaf area, biomass and 3D architecture
Red–green–blue  (RGB)  images  (2056  ×  2454  pixels)  of  each  plant 
were taken daily with 13 views (12 side views from 30° rotational dif-
ference and one top view) by using the imaging units of the platform. 
Each unit is composed of a cabin involving top and side RGB cameras 
(Grasshopper3, Point Grey Research, Richmond, BC, Canada) equipped 
with 12.5–75 mm TV zoom lens (Pentax, Ricoh Imaging, France) and 
LED illumination (5050–6500 K colour temperature). Images were cap-
tured while the plant was rotating at constant rate using a brushless motor 
(Rexroth,  Germany)  and  were  precise  enough  for  picturing  the  cabin 
with negligible spherical aberration (<0.1%). Top and side cameras were 
calibrated using reference objects in order to convert pixels into mm2 and 
to estimate camera poses for 3D reconstruction. Plant pixels from each 
image were segmented from those of the background by using a set of 
threshold algorithms and morphological operators using OpenCV librar-
ies (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008; http://opencv.org; see Brichet et al., 2017 
for details). They were used for estimating the whole plant leaf area and 
fresh biomass via calibration curves with real plants of different genotypes 
at different phenological stages (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). At 
the end of the experiment, plants were harvested and the above ground 
fresh and dry biomasses were recorded.

The 13 images taken for each plant at each date were used to recon-
struct plant 3D architecture. The volume corresponding to each plant was 
computed using a space carving algorithm (Kutulakos and Seitz, 2000) 
and represented by a 3D set of voxels (0.512 cm3 per voxel). This voxel 
set was transformed into a triangular mesh by using the marching cube 
algorithm (Lorensen and Cline, 1987) implemented in the scikit-image 
package  (Van  der Walt  et  al.,  2014). A  custom-made  software  pipeline, 
PHENOMENAL  (version  1.3.0),  processed  the  images,  stored  inter-
mediate  results,  and  distributed  the  computation  on  the  grid  via  the 
cyber-infrastructure  InfraPhenoGrid  (Pradal  et  al.,  2017)  embedded  in 
the scientific workflow system OpenAlea (Pradal et al., 2008,  2015).

Estimating incident radiation and dissecting radiation 
interception efficiency
2D maps of light transmission through the greenhouse were built by using 
hemispherical images taken every square metre in the platform (Cabrera-
Bosquet et al., 2016). This allowed estimation of the amount of light received 
daily by each plant within the platform for every day of the year based on 
light transmission of direct and diffuse light and on incident PPFD meas-
ured above the platform roof every 15 min (SKS 1110, Skye Instruments, 
Llandrindod Wells, UK). This amount was summed to the PPFD emitted 
by lamps for calculation of PPFD per unit horizontal surface area corre-
sponding to each plant within the platform (Ri, mol m−2 d−1).

The maize canopy in the platform was reconstructed every day based 
on the 3D architecture of each plant and its position in the greenhouse. 
The  daily  integral  of  intercepted  photon  flux  was  calculated  for  each 
plant (Rplant, mol plant−1 d−1) by using the RATP light model (Sinoquet 
et  al.,  2001,  version  number  5955). The  scattering  coefficient  of  the 
RATP model (the sum of leaf transmittance and reflection) was assumed 
to be 16%, and the canopy clumping factor was set to 0.8. The recon-
structed 3D canopy in the RATP model was placed within a rectangular 
regular grid, with grid cells length, width, and height equal to 0.2, 0.2, 
and 0.1 m, respectively. Each cell was characterized by the leaf area dens-
ity (cm2 cm−3) obtained by summing the area of all 3D mesh triangles 
included in the cell, regardless of the plant they originated from. The leaf 

Dissecting radiation use efficiency
RUE (g fresh weight mol−1 photons) of each plant was estimated as the 
slope of linear regression between above-ground biomass production and 
cumulative intercepted radiation of the plant in the interval 30–50 d20°C 
(Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2016).

Physiologically, RUE is not a genotypic constant but a variable depend-
ent on the amount of intercepted light per unit leaf area (Rleaf; µmol m−2 
s−1).  Here,  the  daily  average  of  Rleaf  was  calculated  by  first  converting 
the  unit  of  Rplant  (mol  plant−1  d−1)  into  µmol  plant−1  s−1  based  on  the 
photoperiod of 12 h, then dividing Rplant by the leaf area (LA) of the day 
(Rleaf=Rplant/LA). Due to the strong non-linear relationship between RUE 
and Rleaf (Warren-Wilson et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2014a), we linearized 
RUE using a log transformation in order to facilitate further analyses:

where a and b are the slope and intercept of the linear regression, respect-

Simulating biomass accumulation in virtual canopies
The 3D plant architecture corresponding to each plant was used to con-
struct virtual fields with different canopy configurations (i.e. mixture of 
different genotypes, variations in plant density, and different developmen-
tal stages of the plants). Each genotype was represented in virtual canopies 
with random replications of the three plants observed in the experiment 
of spring 2016. In total, more than 10 000 simulations were managed by 
an extended version of the cyber-infrastructure InfraPhenoGrid (Pradal 
et  al.,  2017,  version  PHENOARCH  0.7). The  amount  of  light  inter-
cepted by each individual plant in the virtual fields (Rplant) was calculated 
every day by using the RATP light model. Daily biomass accumulation of 
individual plants (g fresh weight plant−1 d−1) was calculated in the virtual 
canopies with the genotypic values of Rplant, leaf area and εRUE.

Genome-wide association analysis
The 255 lines were genotyped using a 50K Infinium HD Illumina array 
(Ganal  et  al.,  2011),  a  600K Axiom Affymetrix  array  (Unterseer  et  al., 
2014), and a set of 500K markers obtained by Genotyping by Sequencing 
(GBS; S. Negro, S. Nicolas and A. Charcosset, personal communication). 
After data quality control, 758 863 polymorphic single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) were retained for the analysis. For each single experi-
ment, a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed, with 
the methods presented in Millet et al. (2016), for the original components 
of the Monteith equation (biomass, RIE, and RUE), and for the compo-
nents of our new dissection. We used a single locus mixed model:

where Y is the vector of phenotypic values, μ the overall mean, X the vec-
tor of SNP scores with additive effect β, G the random polygenic effects,

Results

Introducing an environmental term that accounts for 
the effect of spatial heterogeneities, thereby increasing 
the heritability of radiation interception efficiency

An  environmental  term  is  justified  because  spatial  heteroge-
neities in the field, such as paths, borders and discontinuities 
in  the  canopy,  considerably  affect  light  interception  by  indi-
vidual plants. In phenotyping platforms, border plants receive 
more  light  than  those  inside  the  canopy.  If  not  corrected  in 
the model, these heterogeneities may considerably decrease the 
heritability of RIE in genetic analyses.

We have first defined radiation interception efficiency at the 
plant level (RIEplant) as the ratio of the amount of light inter-
cepted by a plant to the amount of incident light summed over 
a spatial domain centred on the plant and whose area equals 
the  space  allocated  to  each  plant,  i.e.  the  reciprocal  of  plant 
density.

where Rplant,i (mol plant−1 d−1) is the total light intercepted by 
plant i from the different directions of incidence (as calculated 
by the light model), Ri (mol m−2 d−1) is the photon flux dens-
ity through a horizontal surface above the plant, and D is plant 
density (plants m−2 soil surface area). Hence, RIEplant,i is unitless 
(as RIE is in the Monteith model).

We then introduced a coefficient, the canopy competition 
pressure (CP, m2 leaf area per plant), which takes spatial hetero-
geneities into account via the reciprocal of light interception 
per unit leaf area in the neighbourhood of the considered plant. 
It is defined as the ratio of local mean leaf area (LAc,i, m2 leaf 
area per plant) to the mean radiation interception efficiency in 
the same spatial window. In the experiments considered here, 
this area hosted 15 plants (Fig. 1A).

where  RIEc,i  is  the  mean  RIEplant  in  this  window  (unitless). 
CP  has  lower  values  in  border  plants  than  within  the  can-
opy  because  RIEc,i  is  more  affected  than  mean  leaf  area  by 
the presence of neighbouring plants. This can be visualized in 
Fig. 1B–D, which represents the spatial distribution of CP in 
the  greenhouse  at  three  dates. At  the  beginning  of  the  plant 
cycle  [Fig.  1B;  at  14.5  equivalent  days  at  20  °C  (d20°C)  after 
sowing],  CP  was  uniform  in  the  greenhouse,  meaning  that 
plants inside the canopy were too small to cause mutual shad-
ing. A spatial pattern began to appear 31.2 d20°C after sowing 
and was clear at 45 d20°C. At these dates, the CP of border plants 
was similar to that calculated for the first date, whereas plants 

within the canopy presented much higher CP (for day-to-day 
changes in CP every day; see Supplementary Video S1). The 
non-uniform  CP  inside  the  canopy  reflects  the  fact  that  the 
relationship  between  LA  and  RIE  is  not  linear,  so  the  ratio 
tends  to  increase  for  higher  leaf  area  in  the  considered  win-
dow. The heritability of CP was close to zero throughout the 
experimental period (Fig. 2), suggesting that CP is an essen-
tially environmental variable. CP was also independent of leaf 
area (r2=0.08).

Why correcting RIEplant for the effect of CP is of interest 
can be visualized in Fig. 2. Indeed, the broad-sense heritabil-
ity of the raw value of RIEplant decreased rapidly from 20 to 
30 d20°C after sowing due to the border effect that reduced the 
repeatability of RIEplant for a given genotype. The effect of CP 
on RIEplant was negligible at the beginning of the experiment 
but  largely  increased  with  time. The  heritability  of  RIEplant 
corrected for CP (RIEplant,CP, defined as the product of both 
terms)  did  not  differ  from  that  of  RIEplant  at  the  beginning 
of  the  experiment,  but  remained  at  nearly  constant  values 
throughout the experiment because the environmental com-
ponent of RIEplant was removed (Fig. 2). For example, correct-
ing RIEplant by CP increased heritability from 0.32 to 0.53 at 
the end of the experiment (Fig. 2).

Introducing a competitiveness term that accounts for 
inter-genotypic interactions in light interception

RIEplant,i  is  similar  in  all  plants  of  a  homogeneous  canopy 
because  the  amount  of  light  harvested  by  plant  i  outside  its 
spatial domain matches the amount of light harvested by the 
leaves of neighbouring plants inside its domain. This is not the 
case  in  a  heterogeneous  canopy  because  both  amounts  may 
appreciably differ, so RIEplant,i can largely vary between indi-
vidual plants and can be greater than unity for a plant that is 
more competitive than its neighbours.

The  above-mentioned  effect  was  taken  into  account  via  a 
plant competitiveness index (CI) defined as the ratio of radi-
ation interception efficiency of plant i normalized by its leaf 
area (RIEplant,i/LAi), to the radiation interception efficiency in 
the spatial window centred on plant i (Fig. 1A) corrected by its 
mean leaf area (RIEc,i/LAc,i). CI is therefore unitless. It equals 
1 if plant i intercepts the same amount of light per leaf area as 
the average of its neighbours, and is higher if it intercepts more 
than its neighbours.

where LAi is the leaf area of plant i. Other variables are defined

At the beginning of the plant cycle (14.5 d20°C after sowing), 
CI was close to unity because plants had little interactions with 
their  neighbours,  so  RIEplant  was  closely  related  to  leaf  area 
(Figs 3A, 4A). From the middle of the experiment onwards, CI 
became more diverse between plants (31.2 d20°C, ±20%; Figs 3B, 
4B) and ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 at 45 d20°C (Figs 3C, 4C). At 
this time, RIEplant was related to plant leaf area, but with a large 
variability around the regression line (up to ±40%). Whether 
data  points  were  located  below  or  above  the  regression  line

Fig. 1.  Map of the canopy competition pressure (CP, m2 leaf area per plant) in the phenotyping platform during the experiment of spring 2016.  
(A) A schematic representation of the moving window centred on plant i for each plant of the canopy. (B–D) Thermal times at the beginning (B), middle 
(C), and end (D) of the experiment were 14.5, 31.2, and 45.0 equivalent days at 20 °C, d20°C, after sowing, respectively.

The heritability of CI increased with time, indicating that 
the  genetic  control  of  CI  became  appreciable  after  canopy 
closure  (Fig.  2).  CI  only  explained  0.01%  of  the  variation 
of RIEplant at the beginning of the plant cycle in the experi-
ment of spring 2016, (14.5 d20°C; Fig. 5A), with a heritability 
of 0.13. It explained 49% of the variations of RIEplant later on 
(Fig. 5C; Supplementary Video S3), with a heritability of 0.58. 
The heritability of CI was also high at the end of the experi-
ments of winter and spring 2013 (0.67 and 0.68, respectively; 
Supplementary Table S1).

Dissecting radiation use efficiency into genetic and 
environmental components

Raw values of RUE varied 3-fold, from 9 to 25 g FW mol−1 
between plants, with a low heritability (Table 1). They showed 
a strong dependency on the mean intercepted light per unit leaf 
area of each plant [Rleaf in Eq. (1); Fig. 6A]. Hence, we have dis-
sected RUE into an environmental term, intercepted light, and 
a genetic term estimated as the mean value of the residuals cor-
responding to a genotype in the regression between RUE and 
Rleaf,  after  linearization  via  a  logarithmic  transformation  [Eq. 
(1); Fig. 6B; r2=0.45]. The genotypic differences in RUE were 
therefore characterized by this residual term, named εRUE [Eq. 
(5)], which can be either positive or negative depending on the 
genetic value of the residual in relation to the regression line 
that was common to all genotypes. εRUE had higher heritability 
than raw values of RUE (Table 1), and higher correlation with 

Fig. 2.  Broad-sense heritabilities of radiation interception efficiency at 
plant level (RIEplant, unitless, open circles), of RIEplant corrected for local 
competition pressure (RIEplant,CP, m2 leaf area per plant, black circles), of

competition pressure (CP, m2 leaf area per plant). The heritability of 
leaf area per plant (LA, m2 plant−1, open triangles) is also presented for 
comparison with other indices. Data from the experiment of spring 2016.

depended on the value of CI of the considered plant (Fig. 3C; 
for a temporal dynamic of CI, see Supplementary Video S2). 
Hence, RIEplant could be appreciably higher than 1 for plants 
having high CI (Fig. 3B, C).

The resulting expression of the Monteith equation 
improved the genetic analysis of biomass 
accumulation

Based on the results presented above, we propose a modifica-
tion  of  the  Monteith  equation  for  a  multi-genotype  canopy, 
which  allows  identifying  genotype-dependent  variables  with 
high heritability on one hand and environmental terms on the 
other hand:

where ΔBM/Δt is the increase in biomass production per sim-
ulation step, Ri and CP are environmental variables, a and b are 
statistical parameters valid for the whole panel of hybrids and 
LA, CI, and εRUE are genotype-dependent. Rleaf is the ratio of 
Rplant to LA, and so does not represent an additional variable.

A  first  application  of  Eq.  (7)  was  to  quantify  the  relative 
contributions of the genetic variations in LA, CI and εRUE. For

Uncorrected traits stand for original traits in the Monteith equation: radiation interception efficiency (RIE, unitless), radiation use efficiency (RUE, g fresh 
biomass mol−1 photon) and RIE at the end of the experiments (RIEplant, unitless). The traits proposed in this study are canopy competition pressure (CP, 
m2 leaf area per plant), plant competitiveness index (unitless), and RIEplant corrected for local variations of CP (RIEplant,cp). Colocalizations between traits are 
also presented (number of QTL colocalizations shown in parentheses). Data refer to the experiment of spring 2016. Values corresponding to other traits 
(e.g. leaf area or plant height) can be found in Supplementary Tables S1, S2.

instance, the genetic variations in εRUE ranged between −0.126 
and 0.109 in all experiments, resulting in an influence on bio-
mass up to ±12%, much less than the genetic variations in LA 
and in CI (Table 1;  Supplementary Table S1).

We have run GWAS analyses of the terms in Eq. (7) to test 
the  extent  to  which  the  above  analysis  allowed  better  gen-
etic dissection of biomass accumulation, and to identify which 
variables share part of their genetic controls. 

(i) The identification of the role of an environmental term, CP, 
improved the heritability of RIEplant (Fig. 2), thereby allowing 
identification of more QTLs (15 and eight QTLs, respectively, 
after and before correction; Table 1). As expected for an envir-
onmental term, the heritability of CP was close to 0 and no 
QTL was identified.

(ii)  The  genotypic  dependency  of  CI  after  canopy  closure,  shown 
by the increase with time of heritability (Fig. 2), resulted in seven 
QTLs, three of them co-localizing with QTLs of RIE corrected 
by CP (on bin 3.02, 4.09 and 5.04 with consistent allelic effects; 
Table  1; Supplementary Table S2), and one of them co-localized 
with biomass and RIE with consistent negative allelic effects (bin 
4.09, 234.7  Mb;  Supplementary Table S2). This indicates that the 
dissection proposed here improved the genetic dissection of biomass.

(iii)  The  dissection  of  RUE  into  an  environmental  term  and  a 
genetic term also improved genetic analysis. Indeed, 10 QTLs 
were detected for εRUE, one of them co-locating with a QTL 
for biomass with consistent allelic effects (bin 1.10, 275.1 Mb; 
Supplementary Table S2).

This analysis also allowed identification of variables to which CI 
was genetically linked. CI was related to plant height (r2=0.55), 
with taller plants being more competitive than their neighbours 
(Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. S2). Conversely, CI was essentially 
independent of leaf area (r2=0.00–0.19; Fig. 5; Supplementary 
Video S3). There was only one co-location between QTLs of 
leaf area and of CI (bin 7.02), but this QTL also involved plant 
height, thereby conferring a higher competitiveness to plants 
carrying this allele (Supplementary Table S2). CI was also unre-
lated to CP (r2= 0.01; Fig. 5;  Supplementary Video S3).

The modified Monteith equation also allowed 
estimation of the bias associated with heterogeneities 
of competitiveness in typical breeders’ designs

Another interest of the modified Monteith equation [Eq. (7)] 
is  that  it  can  assess  the  effects  of  heterogeneities  on  biomass

accumulation  by  either  whole  canopies  or  individual  plants 
in  the  canopy.  In  particular,  we  have  used  Eq.  (7)  and  data 
obtained  from  platform  experiments  to  assess  the  bias  asso-
ciated  to  plant  distribution  in  typical  canopy  structures  used 
in breeding programmes. For that, five typical  canopies with 
increasing  complexity  were  generated:  (i)  large  plot  single-
genotype canopies, simulated for all 255 genotypes, resembling 
those  in  farmers’  fields  (canopy A,  Fig.  8A);  (ii)  micro-plots 
of four rows harbouring one genotype each, typically used in 
experiments  for  genetic  analyses  [canopy  B  (Fig.  8B)  simu-
lated here for nine genotypes]; (iii) micro-plots with one geno-
type  per  row,  a  design  corresponding  to  early  generations  of 
breeding programmes (canopy C, Fig. 8C); and (iv) a field with 
either nine or 255 genotypes (canopies D and Dall, respectively; 
Fig. 8D showing canopy Dall) distributed randomly, resembling 
a first generation breeding field, the experimental design of a 
phenotyping  platform  or  a  farmer’s  field  with  mixed  varie-
ties for pest avoidance. The nine genotypes used in canopies B, 
C, and D were classified into three groups by their genotypic 

values of CI in the platform, namely low, middle, and high CI 
(0.73 ± 0.07, 0.99 ± 0.04, and 1.27 ± 0.06, respectively). The 
daily biomass production of each genotype in different cano-
pies was then calculated based on Eq. (7) by using the geno-
typic values measured in the platform experiment.

Genotypes with high CI were favoured in multi-genotype 
canopies associated with breeding programmes (canopies B, 
C, and D) compared with their behaviour in pure canopies 
(canopy A), whereas genotypes with low CI performed bet-
ter in canopy A than in canopies B, C, and D (Fig. 8E). This 
was in spite of the fact that genotypes performed similarly 
when simulated individually in large plots (3.58–3.79 kg m−2)  
and that the overall performance of canopy D was 3.63 kg m−2,  
similar to the mean performance of the same genotypes in 
large plots.

Hence,  the  inter-genotypic  interactions  in  light  capture 
resulted  in  an  appreciable  bias  in  the  comparison  of  geno-
types in multi-genotype canopies (from 3.08 to 4.21 kg m−2 
in  canopy  D).  The  difference  between  simulated  biomass 
between canopies A and Dall reached ±20% and CI explained 
more than 60% of these differences (Fig. 8F). Genotypes with 
intermediate CI performed the same in all canopies whereas 
the competitive advantage of plants with high CI increased 
with the degree of canopy heterogeneity, from canopy B to 
canopy D (Fig. 8E).

Discussion

The revised Monteith equation allowed better dissection 
of the genetic controls of biomass production

Comparing the performance of genotypes in multi-genotypic 
and  heterogeneous  canopies  involves  a  risk  of  confusion  of 
effects  due  to  the  structure  of  the  canopy.  Such  canopies  are 
used for many purposes, such as selection of the F2 to F4 gener-
ations of breeding, studies in phenotyping platforms (Cabrera-
Bosquet  et  al.,  2016),  minimizing  risk  in  yield  loss  (Tilahun, 
1995),  maintaining  productivity  in  subsistence  agriculture 
(Smithson  and  Lenné,  1996)  and  increasing  diversity  for  pest 
management in organic farming (Sapoukhina et al., 2013).

Starting  from  the  original  Monteith  equation  (Monteith, 
1977), our approach (Eq 7) quantitatively dissected biomass of 
individual plants in a multi-genotype canopy into environmen-
tal and genetic terms. By keeping the equation multiplicative 
as in the original Monteith equation, the revised equation pro-
vides a quantitative assessment of the variabilities of the gen-
etic terms (Table 1) and of their impacts on genotypic biomass 
performance in heterogeneous canopies. The fact that the new 
genetic terms (LA, CI, and εRUE) are more heritable (Table 1) 
and  more  reproducible  between  experiments  than  RIE  and 
RUE (Fig. 7) indicates that the attempt to isolate environmental 
from genetic terms was at least partly successful. These genetic 
terms  correlate  better  to  biomass  than  to  each  other  (Fig.  7) 
and their QTLs associate independently with biomass, thereby 
improving the ability to explore their genetic control (Tardieu 
and Tuberosa, 2010). A trade-off of this approach is that fresh 
biomass was taken into account, rather than dry biomass in the 
Monteith  equation.  Biomass  estimation  via  imaging  is  based

on plant volume. A mean correction term transforming fresh 
into  dry  biomass  could  have  been  used,  but  this  would  hide 
the potential genetic variability of plant water content, so we 
preferred keeping fresh biomass in the analysis.

Genetic variations of expansive growth and RUE and 
their effects on canopy biomass production

Improving canopy photosynthesis or RUE has been proposed 
to be the next target for increasing crop yield (Zhu et al., 2010; 
Ort et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016), but our data suggest that the 
explored  genetic  variability  of  RUE,  estimated  via  the  term 
eεRUEin  Eq.  (7),  contributed  only  up  to  ±12%  of  the  varia-
tions  in  biomass  production  in  the  studied  genotypes,  much 
less than that of light interception (Supplementary Table S1). 

This  finding  is  in  agreement  with  virtual  field  experiments 
where the final leaf area explains 80% of the simulated biomass 
in simple canopies involving one genotype. The genetic vari-
ability of expansive growth therefore contributes more to bio-
mass accumulation than that of photosynthesis (Fatichi et al., 
2014; Tardieu et al., 2014). During the vegetative phase, rapid 
expansive  growth  not  only  increases  source  strength  because 
of  the  deterministic  relations  between  canopy  leaf  area,  light 
interception  and  the  size  of  photosynthetic  organs  (Chen 
et al., 2015), but also sink strength via its indirect effect on silk 
growth  (Turc  et  al.,  2016)  that  reduces  the  risk  of  abortion 
(Oury, et al., 2016).

Our data also suggest that the reported 2-fold variations of RUE 
in maize in the field (Louarn et al., 2008; Cicchino et al., 2010; 
Wu et al., 2016) or in a phenotyping platform (Cabrera-Bosquet

Fig. 8.  Virtual experiments simulating biomass of different genotypes under different canopy complexities: (A) canopy A, a simple, large plot canopy 
consisting of one genotype; (B) canopy B, a canopy with four rows per genotype for nine genotypes (only three presented here); (C) canopy C, a canopy 
with one row per genotype for nine genotypes; (D) canopy Dall, a canopy with random mixture of all genotypes. (E) Ratio of the simulated biomass in 
canopies A–D for a given genotype to that in a mono-genotype canopy (relative biomass). Colours denote the group of genotypes with low (orange 
circles, three genotypes), middle (green inverted triangles, three genotypes) and high (blue squares, three genotypes) values of competitiveness index (CI).

et al., 2016), might partly be a consequence of variations in light 
conditions (Fig. 6A). Between European sites, incident light dur-
ing the same phenological stage in maize can vary 3-fold (Millet 
et  al.,  2016).  Meta-analysis  has  also  shown  that  shade  increases 
RUE by up to 200% when the availability of light reduces by 
more than 50% (Slattery et al., 2013), fairly in agreement with 
our data (Fig. 6A).

Instead of fitting the parameters a and b in Eq. (7) for the 
whole  maize  panel,  we  also  tried  several  apparently  more 
deterministic approaches; for example, we considered a and b 
as genetic parameters characterizing the dependency of RUE 
to Rleaf, fitted for each genotype (RUE=e(a×Rleaf+b)). Coefficient 
a describes the decrease in RUE with the increasing light level. 
Therefore,  it  is  related  to  the  convexity  factor  and  the  max-
imal photosynthetic rate of the photosynthetic light response 
curves. Coefficient b can be interpreted as the initial slope of 
the photosynthetic light response curves. In this case, a and b 
could be biologically related to photosynthetic quantum yield 

and  maximal  photosynthetic  capacity,  respectively.  However, 
we finally did not adopt this approach because of the strong 
correlation  (r2=0.96)  between  genotypic  values  of  a  and  b, 
together  with  the  results  of  GWAS  detecting  no  QTL  for 
them. This suggests that apparent genetic differences in a and 
b  were  actually  artefacts  from  the  linear  regression. We  have 
therefore  used  a  parsimonious  alternative  with  one  variable 
only, εRUE, to represent the genetic term in RUE. Although the 
experimental errors are inevitably included in εRUE, the latter 
variable is still more related to genetic controls of biomass than 
RUE, and presents a higher heritability (Fig. 7; Table 1).

The competitiveness index helps assessing the bias 
due to inter-genotypic interactions in early breeding 
programmes

Our results suggest that heterogeneity in canopy structure 
may  have  appreciable  implications  for  interpreting  results

from breeders’ early generations of selection and from phe-
notyping platforms. A recent experimental study also sug-
gests large differences between yield of wheat in mixed and 
monoculture due to inter-genotypic competition (Weiner 
et  al.,  2017). A  consequence  of  inter-genotypic  competi-
tion, also called competitive response (Bartelheimer, et al., 
2015),  is  that  genotypes  with  good  performance  in  one-
genotype canopies might be discarded during the breeding 
process due to a low competitiveness compared with other 
genotypes.  In  the  early  generations  of  selection,  breeders 
might therefore select genotypes with architectural advan-
tages in competing light (high CI), such as plastic responses 
for shade avoidance, to increase competitive effects on the 
neighbouring  plants  (Abley  et  al.,  2016,  Subrahmaniam 
et al., 2018), especially under high planting density (Schmitt 
et al., 1995, Weiner et al., 2017), rather than selecting gen-
otypes  with  high  potential  in  simple  canopies  with  one 
genotype.
