Machine learning (ML) has great potential to drive scientific discovery by harvesting data from images of herbarium specimens—preserved plant 
material curated in natural history collections—but ML techniques have only recently been applied to this rich resource. ML has particularly 
strong prospects for the study of plant phenological events such as growth and reproduction. As a major indicator of climate change, driver of 
ecological processes, and critical determinant of plant fitness, plant phenology is an important frontier for the application of ML techniques for 
science and society. In the present article, we describe a generalized, modular ML workflow for extracting phenological data from images of 
herbarium specimens, and we discuss the advantages, limitations, and potential future improvements of this workflow. Strategic research and 
investment in specimen-based ML methods, along with the aggregation of herbarium specimen data, may give rise to a better understanding 
of life on Earth.

Keywords: phenology, machine learning, biodiversity, climate change, deep learning

Seasonal  variation  in  the  timing  of  life  cycle     

  (phenological)  events  (e.g.,  leaf-out,  flowering,  and 
fruiting)  critically  affects  plant  ecology  and  evolution 
through  interactions  between  plants  and  climate  (Cleland 
et  al.  2007),  herbivores  (Meineke  et  al.  2014),  mutualists 
(Diamond et al. 2014), and inter- and intraspecific competi-
tors (Heberling et al. 2019). Changes in the timing of plant 
phenological  events  can  alter  species  interactions,  such  as 
those  between  plants  and  their  pollinators  (Burkle  et  al. 
2013) and even disrupt interactions at higher trophic levels, 
such as those between bears and salmon (Deacy et al. 2017). 
The  significance  and  complexity  of  plant  phenology  on 
local  and  global  scales  lead  to  many  compelling  questions 
for  science  and  society  (Ellwood  et  al.  2019),  especially  as 
anthropogenic changes in habitat, biodiversity, and climate 
alter phenological events (Parmesan and Yohe 2003).

Wide-ranging  and  complex  phenological  responses  to 
climate  change  have  been  discovered  in  many  taxa  across 
the globe (Willis et al. 2017a), but our understanding of the 
mechanisms driving these complicated phenomena and their 
subsequent effects are incomplete. Critical questions remain 
about the effects and interactions of climate, traits, geogra-
phy, and phylogeny on the phenological sensitivities of plants 

and  how  these  effects  propagate  throughout  ecosystems 
(box  1).  These  factors  could  play  key  roles  in  understand-
ing, predicting, and potentially ameliorating environmental 
changes that threaten biodiversity and humankind.

The variable and context-dependent nature of plant phe-
nology  renders  its  study  particularly  challenging  because 
long-term  data  sets  are  necessary  to  detect  the  patterns, 
causes, and consequences of phenological change for a given 
taxon in a given location (Wolkovich et al. 2012). Historical 
phenological  observations  (Primack  and  Miller-Rushing 
2012),  agricultural  records  (e.g.,  crop  harvest  records; 
Ellwood  et  al.  2014),  long-term  field  stations  (Taylor  et  al. 
2018),  and,  more  recently,  citizen  science  networks  (Bison 
et al. 2018) have proven vital sources of phenological data. 
However,  none  of  these  resources  provides  the  spatio-
temporal  coverage  available  from  herbarium  specimens. 
Herbarium  specimens  have  been  archived  for  hundreds  of 
years  from  across  the  globe  and  therefore  represent  a  rich 
source of phenological data (Zalamea et al. 2011), especially 
as specimen data (e.g., date, species, and locality) and speci-
men  images  become  digitally  available  through  large-scale 
digitization  projects  (Nelson  and  Ellis  2018).  Specimen-
based  studies  have  greatly  informed  our  understanding  of

Box 1. Example questions to advance the study of plant phenology using machine learning approaches.

Phenological research questions well suited for ML-based analyses

The following list contains ecoevolutionary questions that require large sample sizes or, potentially, fine-scale data collection, rendering 
manual collection of phenological data from herbarium specimens infeasible. 

•	 How is morphological variation related to phenology?

•	 Within or across species, do male and female flowers or individuals have different phenological responses to climate variables?

•	

 Do closely related species differ in their phenological sensitivity to climate? If so, are such differences related to differences between 
taxa in habitat, climatic tolerance, geographic distribution, mean flowering time, or nonphenological traits?

•	 Do species with unisexual flowers differ in their phenological responsiveness from species with cosexual (i.e., perfect) flowers?

•	 How can certain phenophases be quantified in a way that is useful for predicting seasonal allergens, e.g., maturation of male catkins?

•	 How do global events affect regional phenology?

•	

 What and where are phenological dark data  (i.e.,  taxonomic,  geographic,  or  other groups for which little phenological data are 
available)?

•	 How do climate and other factors affect how many flowers in an inflorescence become fruits (i.e., reproductive output)?

•	 How do climate and other factors affect the sizes and shapes of reproductive structures?

•	

 How does the timing of phenological events and species-specific cues vary with latitude and across the globe? Do these interactions 
vary with climate change?

•	 How do nonnative species differ from native species with respect to phenological or distributional responses to climate change?

•	 How does nonangiosperm phenology (e.g., pollen release dates of gymnosperms) respond to climate and other factors?

•	

 How do changes in plant phenology affect interactions between plants and other communities or trophic levels, including insects, 
pests, birds, and mammals?

Questions about ML methodology

This list consists of questions relating to the methodology and limitations of machine learning for assessing phenology from herbarium 
specimens.

•	 Can ML algorithms reliably recognize plant reproductive structures?

•	 Can ML methods appropriately convey the level of confidence or uncertainty associated with any given classification or count?

•	

 How many training images are necessary to train phenological data sets, and does this number exceed the number of specimens 
needed to conduct phenological studies?

•	 How does a computer “decide” how to classify specimens, and is the decision process generalizable?

•	 What are systematic errors from ML that could propagate and impact studies that use automatically annotated data?

•	 At which taxonomic scales and physical dimensions can ML contribute to phenological studies?

•	

 How can the robustness of phenological annotations with ML approaches be ensured in data-deficient contexts (e.g., rare species 
or neglected floras)?

phenological  change  beyond  what  was  previously  possible 
(Willis et al. 2017a).

To  date,  most  phenological  studies  using  herbarium 
specimens  have  relied  on  manual  annotation  (see  table  1 
for  a  glossary  of  italicized  terms)  of  specimens  to  record 
phenological  traits  (Willis  et  al.  2017a).  Herbarium  staff 
might  record  the  presence  or  absence  of  reproductive 
structures while transcribing specimen data, or, more com-
monly, researchers classify phenological traits from physical 

specimens  or  specimen  images  for  specific  projects.  Such 
methods are time and labor intensive, and the accuracy and 
precision of the resulting phenological annotations depend 
on  the  botanical  expertise  and  consistency  of  the  scorer, 
as  well  as  on  how  easily  the  relevant  anatomical  structures 
can be identified on dried, pressed plants. To study phenol-
ogy  on  a  global  scale,  many  thousands—even  millions—of 
specimens  must  be  annotated,  but  manual  annotation  at 
this scale is not feasible. Machine learning (ML) approaches

Definition
Term

Annotation

Bounding box

Data added to a specimen record that is ancillary to the original collection data; annotations include, for 
example, phenological status, taxonomic identification, and georeferenced coordinates of a specimen; or 
the process of adding such ancillary data to a specimen record

(Often rectangular) area on a two-dimensional image that contains all points belonging to a given object; 
the sides of this area are defined by the extreme edges of the object

Convolutional neural network (CNN)

Type of neural network especially suited for image analysis that automatically learns relevant filters; 
other approaches use handcrafted filters and handcrafted feature extractors

Cyberinfrastructure

Deep learning

Domain adaptation

Filter

Computational environment and personnel resources which allow a combination of several tasks, 
including data acquisition, storage, management, mining, visualization, and analysis

Subset of machine learning techniques consisting of neural network models with a high number of 
successive layers; such models have been especially successful in tackling image, sound, and text tasks

Field of machine learning in which a model trained on a certain set of training data is co-opted for a 
different, but somewhat related, target data set

In image analysis, a specific type of local operation, i.e., a convolution, applied on the neighborhood of 
a pixel, designed to remove unwanted features from the image while preserving relevant information to 
perform a task, e.g., edge detectors for classification purposes

Graphics processing unit (GPU)

Hardware originally designed to accelerate computer graphics operations before being used for other 
kinds of computations; used heavily in deep learning computations

Instance segmentation

In image analysis, the task of finding the objects present in an image and their segmentation mask

Machine learning (ML)

Metadata

Object detection

Plant phenology ontology (PPO)

Prediction

Segmentation mask

Training data or data set

Wide class of methods dedicated to the problem of training a computer to automatically learn to make 
predictions about novel data using annotated samples from a training data set

Data used to describe or augment existing data

In image analysis, the task of finding the objects present in an image and their bounding box

The structured vocabulary for describing plant phenological observations that was developed to 
allow harmonization of data across disparate phenological data sets, including those from herbarium 
specimens (Stucky et al. 2018, Brenskelle et al. 2019)

The output of a learning model, which is used to predict the most likely value or a mask for a new image

Defined path around an object containing exactly all the pixels of an image corresponding to that object, 
and only them

Subset of the target data set to be annotated that is used to train ML algorithms according to the 
annotation schema; the training data set must already be annotated and should ideally contain a 
representative sample of the visual variation in the target data set

Transfer learning

Using knowledge gained from one domain of machine learning to improve another domain

have the potential to overcome this challenge by automating 
phenological data acquisition. ML approaches have empow-
ered advances in many areas of science and technology, with 
applications from self-driving cars (Wulff et al. 2018) to bio-
medical imaging (Ronneberger et al. 2015). Plant phenology, 
one of the best-known indicators of climate change, presents 
a fast-growing frontier for the deployment of these powerful 
methods.

ML  algorithms  build  statistical  models  from  input  data 
(i.e.,  training  data),  and  these  models  can  then  be  applied 
to make  predictions  on novel data (LeCun et  al.  2015).  For 
image annotation tasks, for example, ML algorithms create 
statistical models (“learn”) from a training data set of images 
that have already been annotated. Then, the algorithms use 
these  models  to  predict  annotations  for  images  that  have 
not  been  annotated.  ML  has  been  successfully  applied  to 
many  biological  studies  requiring  classification  of  visual 
information, including the recognition and classification of 
animals  in  camera  trap  images  (Norouzzadeh  et  al.  2018) 
and the automated species identification of herbarium speci-
mens  (e.g.,  Unger  et  al.  2016,  Carranza-Rojas  et  al.  2017). 

Successful  application  of  ML  techniques  to  phenological 
annotation  tasks  has  only  recently  been  demonstrated  for 
herbarium  specimen  images  (Lorieul  et  al.  2019).  In  the 
present article, we describe a generalized ML workflow for 
phenological annotation of plant specimen images, and we 
discuss  the  advantages,  limitations,  and  potential  future 
improvements  of  this  workflow.  Furthermore,  we  explore 
how  technological  advances  in  ML  will  facilitate  the  col-
lection of additional phenological and other trait data from 
images,  enhancing  ecoevolutionary  research  and  biodiver-
sity education.

Figure 1 presents a workflow of five components for pheno-
logical annotation of herbarium specimen images (storage, 
generating  training  data,  machine  learning,  deployment, 
and testing and analysis; figure 1), further described below. 
A detailed discussion of ML methodology can be found in 
Lorieul and colleagues (2019). In the present article, we use 
the term annotation to describe the general process of add-
ing ancillary data to a specimen record. Although we focus

Figure 1. Key components of a generalized, modular machine learning (ML) workflow applied to the annotation of herbarium 
specimen images for phenological traits. Specimen images are retrieved from storage, and a representative subset of the focal 
images are used to generate a set of training data. The training data, which have been manually annotated according to the 
desired phenological scoring protocol (e.g., flowers present or absent), are used as input data for ML. The resulting statistical 
model is then deployed to predict phenological annotations for previously unannotated specimens. The accuracy and 
precision of the ML model(s) can be tested using a subset of manually annotated data to compare predicted annotations to 
those recorded by expert observers. Newly annotated specimens, combined with specimen label data, georeferenced localities, 
and other data sets (e.g., historical climate data), can then be used in an array of phenological research.

on phenological annotation—recording of the phenological 
status of a specimen—many other types of annotation exist, 
such as georeferencing, taxonomic identification, and scor-
ing of nonphenological traits.

Core  specimen  data,  such  as  collection  date,  scientific 
name, collector name, and textual locality information, are 
often captured and mobilized as part of large-scale digitiza-
tion initiatives (e.g., more than 120 million specimen records 
contain  this  information  in  iDigBio;  www.idigbio.org). 
Therefore, we do not describe the use of ML for harvesting 

these data. We focus in the present article on the application 
of ML to automatically identify and record the phenological 
status  of  specimen  images,  ideally  those  images  for  which 
these core specimen data are already available.

Storage.  Input and output data for ML approaches consist of 
digital images of specimens, associated core specimen data 
(e.g., specimen identifier, collection date, etc.), and pheno-
logical annotations. High-resolution images (e.g., up to tens 
of millions of pixels per specimen) can represent a very large

volume of data (4–10 megabytes per image), and their stor-
age therefore requires software and hardware infrastructure 
designed for large amounts of data.

Generating training data.  The images used to “train” ML algo-
rithms must first be manually annotated with phenological 
information according to the desired protocol. For example, 
if a researcher is interested only in whether a specimen has 
flowers, each specimen image would be annotated as flow-
ers  “present”  or  “absent.”  A  model  based  on  these  training 
data  will  classify  specimens  as  either  of  these  two  classes. 
If  the  researcher  wishes  to  detect  individual  reproductive 
structures  on  a  specimen,  for  example,  in  order  to  count 
them  or  estimate  their  relative  proportions,  these  could  be 
delineated  by  bounding  boxes,  which  indicate  the  general 
location  of  structures,  or  segmentation  masks,  which  des-
ignate  all  pixels  belonging  to  a  reproductive  structure.  To 
produce  these  more  complex  annotations,  specific  annota-
tion tools are usually required (e.g., CocoAnnotator, https://
annotator.justinbrooks.ca; LabelMe, http://labelme.csail.mit.
edu/Release3.0;  ImageTagger,  https://github.com/bit-bots/
imagetagger). Regardless of the type of phenological annota-
tion being created, it is important to recognize that ML is a 
form of statistical inference that finds patterns in the train-
ing data, and predictions will therefore reflect any biases in 
those  data.  Therefore,  the  training  data  set  should  include 
a  representative  sample  of  taxon  (or  taxa)  and  phenologi-
cal  attributes  or  categories  that  should  appear  in  the  data 
set  on  which  the  trained  model  will  be  applied.  A  lack  of 
visual diversity in the manual annotations will result in the 
same  lack  of  diversity  in  the  predictions.  Similarly,  noisy, 
imprecise,  or  incomplete  annotations  may  result  in  noisy, 
imprecise, or incomplete predictions. A subset of the train-
ing  data  should  also  be  reserved  for  model  validation  (see 
the “Testing and analysis” section).

The  number  of  specimens  necessary  to  train  a  model 
depends  on  the  complexity  of  the  classification  task,  the 
number and morphological diversity of taxa included in the 
data  set,  and  whether  the  model  will  be  trained  iteratively. 
Initial models with a small set of training data (at least 500 
specimens)  can  be  used  to  annotate  a  much  larger  set  of 
data, and the ML-generated annotations can be revised and 
enriched  through  additional  manual  annotation,  and  then 
used to train the model further (see Affouard et al. 2017). As 
the annotated training data set grows, models will improve 
and  become  more  useful  for  identifying  edge  cases  (e.g., 
specimens  on  which  phenological  attributes  are  partially 
obscured, taxa that are represented by only a few specimens) 
that might be missing in a small training data set, as well as 
phenological phases that are morphologically highly variable 
or represented by very small reproductive structures.

Machine  learning  and  deep  learning.  For  image  data,  the  most 
effective  machine  learning  techniques  are  deep  learning 
neural  networks,  or  more  precisely,  convolutional  neural 
networks  (CNN),  or  extensions  such  as  CNNs  for  object 

Biologist’s Toolbox

detection (e.g., R-CNN) or instance segmentation (e.g., Mask-
R-CNN). Like any neural network, a CNN is a composition 
of  functions  that  receive  an  image  as  input  and  provide 
predictions as output (e.g., a phenological score of the entire 
specimen  or  a  set  of  bounding  boxes  around  reproductive 
structures). The term convolutional refers to the fact that for 
each  input  pixel,  the  functions  return  the  result  of  a  local 
computation (a filter) based on the pixel and its neighboring 
pixels.  The  number  of  neighboring  pixels  (i.e.,  filter  size) 
is set as a parameter of the model. Each filter can be inter-
preted as a detector of a specific, local visual pattern.

CNNs  consist  of  multiple  layers  of  processing.  The  first 
layers  of  a  CNN  detect  low-level  patterns  (color  changes, 
angles,  textures,  etc.),  whereas  the  last  layers  recognize 
complex  visual  patterns  (such  as  reproductive  structures 
on  a  specimen)  by  combining  the  patterns  found  in  previ-
ous  layers.  The  main  objective  of  the  training  phase  of  a 
CNN  model  is  to  estimate  the  parameters  of  these  filters 
on the basis of the training data. This is done by iteratively 
minimizing a loss function measuring the error between the 
predictions and the expected manual annotations.

As  the  number  of  parameters  to  be  estimated  can  be  in 
the millions, this training phase consumes significant com-
putational  resources,  because  the  training  process  requires 
efficient storage to handle frequent access to the training set 
and efficient graphics processing units (GPUs) to reduce the 
training  time.  The  type  of  model  may  differ  depending  on 
the  task,  but  the  duration  of  the  training  phase  is  strongly 
related to the GPU number and characteristics. The greater 
the availability of computational resources, the more train-
ing  a  model  can  undergo,  and  the  better  the  final  model 
architecture and parameter selection can be.

Available  online  tools  can  enable  inexperienced  users 
to  train  ML  models,  but  these  tools  are  limited  to  simple 
image classification tasks and low data volumes. Therefore, 
at  present,  developing  accurate  models  is  often  achieved 
by  involving  a  data  scientist  for  several  days,  weeks,  or 
months depending on the difficulty of the task. The software 
frameworks  most  commonly  used  to  develop  CNNs  are 
Pytorch (https://pytorch.org), TensorFlow (www.tensorflow.
org), CAFFE (https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org), and MXNET 
(https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org).  The  framework  that 
is  best  for  a  given  task  will  depend  on  a  variety  of  factors, 
including the availability of preexisting models or code for 
the targeted task, the hardware used, or simply the data sci-
entist’s skills with respect to a particular framework.

Deployment.  Once an ML model is trained, it can be deployed 
to  predict  phenological  annotations  for  previously  unan-
notated  specimens.  This  process  could  be  implemented  in 
several ways, including via a web service available to other 
applications that returns the model output for any submitted 
image, a standalone program, or an end-user graphical user 
interface  (GUI)  web  application.  Inference  is  usually  a  less 
computationally  intensive  task  than  training  and  therefore 
requires  fewer  resources.  Models  can  be  publicly  shared

through software repositories hosted on sites such as GitHub 
(https://github.com),  GitLab  (https://gitlab.com),  or  dedi-
cated  platforms  such  as  Model  Zoo  (https://modelzoo.co). 
Such  sharing  encourages  cross-model  improvement  based 
on  transfer  learning  (Bengio  2012)  or  domain  adaptation 
techniques (Long et al. 2016).

Testing  and  analysis.    Once  deployed,  a  model  can  be  evalu-
ated  through  qualitative  judgments  or  quantitative  mea-
surements.  Qualitative  judgments  are  typically  performed 
through  a  GUI,  allowing  the  researcher  to  visualize  and 
assess  the  automated  predictions  of  the  model  on  this  test 
data set. For more robust measures of model accuracy, quan-
titative  measurements  of  the  quality  of  the  predictions  can 
be readily calculated and visualized (see Lorieul et al. 2019). 
This  step  cannot  be  performed  on  the  same  data  used  for 
training the model; a model can perfectly fit the training data 
and not fit new data of the same type. Therefore, some of the 
manually annotated data (e.g., 20%–30%) must be reserved 
and  not  used  for  training  purposes  (Carranza-Rojas  et  al. 
2017). As with developing appropriate training data, a deep 
understanding  of  the  data  set  and  the  desired  end  product 
is necessary. The goals are to determine whether the model 
meets the needs of the researcher and to identify the neces-
sary  progress  points  (e.g.,  new  annotations  on  a  particular 
taxonomic group or phenological stage).

Advantages of machine learning for phenology
The main advantage of using ML for phenological annota-
tion is ML’s ability to score very large volumes of data in a 
short amount of time. Once an algorithm has been trained, 
it  can  score  tens  to  thousands  of  specimens  per  minute, 
depending  on  the  task,  with  a  single  standard  GPU.  For 
example, during summer 2019, more than 490,000 field plant 
images were analyzed for species identification on the public 
Pl@ntNet  platform  in  a  single  day  (Affouard  et  al.  2017). 
Model processing can be further accelerated by using many 
GPUs  in  parallel.  Another  key  advantage  is  that  the  accu-
racy of ML annotations can be very high. The deep learning 
method evaluated in Lorieul and colleagues (2019) correctly 
detected fertile specimens with an accuracy of 96.3%. Such 
a success rate is quite high, especially considering that one 
coauthor of the present article obtained an accuracy of only 
87.8% at the same task. Accuracy was slightly decreased for 
finer-scale  phenological  annotations  (84.3%  for  the  detec-
tion of flowers and 80.5% for the detection of fruits) or for 
determining  specific  phenophases  of  specimens,  but  again, 
the model’s accuracy was slightly better than the accuracy of 
a human expert.

With  the  large  volumes  of  phenological  data  produced 
from  ML  methods,  it  will  be  possible  to  create  phenocli-
matic  and  other  phenological  models  at  unprecedented 
scales of time, space, and phylogenetic diversity. Leveraging 
a  large  number  of  specimens  for  phenological  models  has 
already  helped  identify  influential  climate  variables  that 
may  have  been  overlooked  in  previous  studies  (Park  and 

Mazer 2018). Large sample sizes and potentially finer scales 
of  phenological  annotation  could  further  elucidate  dif-
ferences  in  phenological  trends  among  taxa  and  between 
regions. Phenological annotation via ML could also be used 
to address current spatial biases in phenological studies, for 
example,  through  applications  using  herbarium  specimens 
from tropical and subtropical climates, where phenological 
trends are less well documented (Willis et al. 2017a).

Limitations of machine learning applications
The  workflow  described  above  is  not  without  limitations; 
there are technological, social, and logistical challenges that 
must be overcome for efficient application of ML in pheno-
logical research. Herbarium specimens may themselves limit 
their utility for phenological scoring, because they differ in 
quality and quantity (figure 2; for a review, see Willis et al. 
2017a). The morphological structures necessary to measure 
a  given  phenological  trait  may  be  damaged  or  lost,  stored 
in  opaque  fragment  packets,  or  obscured  by  other  plant 
material  on  the  sheet.  Some  plant  taxa  have  phenological 
stages  that  are  impossible  to  determine  without  dissecting 
the  physical  specimen.  For  example,  the  fruits  of  sedges 
are  often  indistinguishable  from  female  flowers,  and  fig 
flowers  are  tightly  enclosed  within  vegetative  receptacles. 
Furthermore,  herbarium  specimens  often  consist  of  only  a 
portion of a plant, and therefore the reproductive status of 
the  entire  plant  may  not  be  readily  discernible  except  via 
the  label  or  field  notes,  when  they  exist.  In  each  of  these 
cases, ML algorithms, no matter how accurate at recogniz-
ing reproductive structures on herbarium specimen images, 
cannot  fully  determine  the  phenological  status  of  a  plant 
from a specimen.

Beyond these general issues, there are additional consid-
erations  for  applying  ML  to  herbarium  specimen  images. 
Specimens contain a significant amount of nonplant mate-
rial  such  as  herbarium  stamps  or  logos,  labels,  mounting 
tape,  color  standard  plates,  rulers,  or  evidence  of  past 
pest-control measures that may bias certain ML classifica-
tion tasks (figure 2). Because ML techniques use all visual 
data  available,  the  algorithms  could  reflect  differences  in 
preparation techniques rather than in the presence or num-
bers of particular plant structures. Finally, when preparing 
training data sets, users of herbarium data must be aware 
of  duplicate  specimens—the  same  species  collected  at  the 
same time in the same place—and of possible misidentified 
specimens.

Future solutions for developing optimal machine 
learning workflows
Perhaps  the  greatest  limitation  of  the  ML  workflow  is  the 
requirement  for  adequate  training  data  sets.  Training  data 
sets need not be large, but a visually diverse set of specimen 
images  of  focal  taxa  must  be  available.  Although  several 
million herbarium specimens have been digitized and mobi-
lized online (currently nearly 30 million images in iDigBio), 
most of the 375 million specimens in herbarium collections

Figure 2. Examples of herbarium specimens displaying visual heterogeneity (e.g., in morphology, labels, and color 
standards) and challenges related to the morphology and position of reproductive structures. The specimen on the left 
shows large, isolated reproductive structures that would likely be annotated successfully by ML algorithms. The specimen 
in the center with small flowers and numerous overlapping fruits would be much more difficult for ML algorithms to parse. 
The specimen on the right would be very difficult for ML algorithms to delineate or count because of the unclear distinction 
between flowers and buds. Examples of segmentation masks (see the glossary in box 1) created to delineate reproductive 
structures are shown by the brightly colored areas in the left and center specimen images.

worldwide are not digitized. Continued digitization of her-
barium specimens is needed, particularly of phylogenetically 
and  morphologically  diverse  collections  that  can  reflect 
visual variation among specimens and therefore enable the 
creation of more versatile training data sets.

As  more  specimen  images  become  available,  they  must 
also  be  accurately  annotated  according  to  the  desired  phe-
nological classification protocol. Citizen science and crowd-
sourcing  can  accelerate  the  image  annotation  process,  as 
has  been  demonstrated  by  platforms  such  as  Zooniverse 
(www.zooniverse.org), From the Page (https://fromthepage.
com), Pl@ntNet (https://plantnet.org/en), and CrowdCurio 
(Willis et al. 2017b). Engaging students in this process as a 
learning experience could be a dual-benefit solution (see the 
“Extending machine learning” section). Mass annotation by 
volunteers  with  heterogeneous  skills  presents  its  own  chal-
lenges,  including  the  need  to  attract  and  retain  volunteer 
interest and ensure data quality, but it offers the additional 
benefits of community engagement and education.

Regardless  of  how  training  data  sets  are  created,  both 
input  and  output  data  of  ML  analyses  must  be  accessible, 
reproducible, and reusable. ML metadata, such as the type of 
model used to create the prediction, the contact information 
of  the  model  creator,  uncertainty  regarding  phenological 
predictions, and reference to the training data set, must be 

carefully documented so that downstream users can repro-
duce and assess the utility of the scorings for their specific 
research  purposes.  Furthermore,  the  potentially  complex 
outputs  of  ML  approaches  (e.g.,  coordinates  of  reproduc-
tive structures on an image) must be stored in a way that is 
interoperable with alternative specimen classification meth-
ods (e.g., manual annotation) and intelligible to nonexperts 
of ML, while at the same time being reproducible by those 
with  ML  expertise.  The  development  of  standard  vocabu-
laries,  metadata  protocols,  and  data  structures  within  the 
scaffold of existing biodiversity data standards (i.e., Darwin 
Core;  see  Yost  et  al.  2018)  would  greatly  advance  this  aim. 
When  designing  ML-based  phenological  studies,  research-
ers  should  consider  how  to  integrate  output  data  and 
metadata with existing databases or data sets, ideally using 
terms and relationships from the Plant Phenology Ontology 
(Stucky et al. 2018, Brenskelle et al. 2019). A relatively small 
investment  early  in  the  research  process  can  ensure  that 
ML-generated, “extended” data (sensu Lendemer et al. 2019) 
can  be  productively  leveraged  by  other  researchers  and 
owners of the original data (i.e., natural history collections), 
thereby  increase  the  value  of  the  specimens.  This  process 
would benefit from further discussion across biological and 
computer science disciplines, for example, within the frame-
work of the Research Data Alliance (www.rd-alliance.org).

Another  significant  advance  for  ML-based  phenologi-
cal  annotation  would  be  a  better  understanding  of  the 
limitations  of  ML  methods  for  phenological  annotation 
tasks.  Current  specimen-based  studies  using  ML  have  yet 
to  diversify  beyond  simple  classification  tasks  (e.g.,  whole 
images  classified  as  “flower  present”  or  “flower  absent”)  to 
more  complex  tasks,  such  as  object  detection  and  localiza-
tion (see Girshick et al. 2014) or the use of models that focus 
on a subset of visual data, rather than the entire image (see 
Mnih  et  al.  2014).  To  move  forward  with  the  design  and 
implementation of ML techniques for phenological studies, 
questions  concerning  methodology  and  appropriateness 
(e.g., table 1) must be addressed with future research.

However,  evaluating  models  with  high  complexity  may 
not  be  easy  to  achieve  given  presently  available,  highly 
localized  cyberinfrastructure.  ML  approaches,  especially 
those  using  thousands  of  high-resolution  images,  require 
computers  with  fast  GPUs,  but  high-power  computing 
clusters  are  generally  heavier  in  central  processing  units 
(CPUs)  than  GPUs.  Therefore,  having  advanced  comput-
ing  resources  does  not  necessarily  guarantee  the  ability  to 
conduct  image-based  ML  experiments.  Although  publicly 
accessible GPU resources (e.g., XSEDE; Towns et al. 2014) 
and sharing of ML methods (e.g., through Model Zoo) are 
growing,  large-scale  and  collaborative  platforms  for  using 
and  sharing  ML  techniques  for  biological  applications  are 
lacking.  Greater  investment  in  interoperable  cyberinfra-
structure  resources  that  are  available  to  a  broader,  collab-
orative community is needed.

Increased  communication,  collaboration,  and  sharing  of 
cyberinfrastructure  resources  across  institutional  and  dis-
ciplinary boundaries (e.g., between computer scientists and 
biodiversity  data  managers)  are  also  critical  to  advancing 
this  field.  Fully  exploring  the  potential  of  ML  approaches 
may  require  collaboration  beyond  academia.  Several  pri-
vate companies already provide financial or IT resources to 
advance ML techniques in the fields of biodiversity, agricul-
ture, and the environment, including Microsoft, with the AI 
for Earth initiative, and Google, which supports workshops 
on the fine-grained visual categorization of various biologi-
cal entities. Collaboration with technology companies such 
as FaceBook, Dell, or Nvidia, which have significant exper-
tise and resources in this field, may be influential in the suc-
cessful development and deployment of ML applications for 
large herbarium collections.

Many  of  the  challenges  in  the  phenological  workflow 
outlined above are generalizable, and ML innovations from 
other disciplines hold promise for applications in herbarium 
science.  Broadly,  museum-based  applications  may  benefit 
from innovations in ML model architectures in which tasks 
are  general  (e.g.,  segmenting  images  into  constituent  ele-
ments),  transfer  learning  from  other  domains  in  which 
plant  images  may  be  used  (e.g.,  agricultural  applications), 
and ML-based applications in associated data-rich domains 
in which images are associated with rich tabular data (e.g., 
medical  images,  which  may  be  linked  to  multidimensional 

patient histories) (Esteva et al. 2017). Advances in medical 
imaging  in  which  specific  anatomical  structures  need  to 
be  identified,  measured,  and  evaluated  for  patient  diagno-
sis  have  already  provided  the  ML  community  with  model 
architectures (Ronneberger et al. 2015) that are now applied 
broadly  to  segmentation  tasks  in  domains  as  seemingly 
distant as automated driving (Wulff et al. 2018). Other disci-
plines that may yield useful innovations include astronomy, 
single-cell  phenotyping,  finance,  e-commerce,  manufactur-
ing,  and  defense.  Potentially  useful  botanical  applications 
shared with these domains include anomaly detection, seg-
mentation,  high-dimensional  image-based  clustering,  and 
digital transcription. Recent advances in  digital agriculture 
(e.g.,  Ghosal  et  al.  2018)  present  a  number  of  promising 
avenues  for  extension  into  phenological  research,  most 
importantly  because  visual  models  in  agriculture  are  often 
trained to interpret images of plants and identify important 
plant structures and attributes (Ferentinos 2018).

Perhaps  the  most  important  aspect  to  improving  ML 
applications  for  herbarium  specimens  is  open  discussion 
and collaboration between biological and computer science 
communities. This includes continued development of the 
community  of  biologists  who  are  interested  in  applying 
these  models  to  ecological  and  evolutionary  questions,  as 
well  as  finding  appropriate  avenues  through  which  biolo-
gists  can  communicate  pressing  goals  in  biodiversity  sci-
ence  to  ML  experts.  Ultimately,  these  communities  must 
also  communicate  effectively  with  end  users  of  automati-
cally  scored  specimen  records,  such  as  ecologists  and  col-
lection managers, to promote understanding of ML-derived 
outputs and their limitations.

Diversifying phenological research using machine 
learning
Most  herbarium-based  phenological  research  to  date  has 
focused  on  understanding  the  timing  of  key  flowering 
events,  especially  first  flowering  or  peak  flowering,  using 
fairly simple phenological annotation protocols (Willis et al. 
2017a).  However,  many  specimens  contain  multiple  repro-
ductive  structures  representing  a  gradient  of  phenological 
stages  (e.g.,  flower  buds  and  open  flowers  present).  ML 
methods could be leveraged to quantify numbers of repro-
ductive  structures  on  specimens,  which  provides  a  more 
detailed understanding of phenological traits such as flower-
ing duration, the rate of progression between phenophases, 
and phenophase-specific responses to climate change (Love 
et al. 2019).

The  phenology  of  less  well-studied  taxonomic  and 
regional  groups  such  as  bryophytes,  ferns,  gymnosperms, 
and  taxa  in  tropical  climates  could  also  be  accelerated  by 
ML approaches. Furthermore, herbarium specimens can be 
used to assess nonreproductive phenological processes such 
as leaf-out (Everill et al. 2014). In some taxa, it may even be 
possible  to  track  phenological  patterns  of  primary  growth 
such as stem elongation. ML-based methods could provide 
a reliable approach to annotating the vegetative phenology of

Extending machine learning analysis of herbarium 
specimens beyond phenology
The  current  era  of  rapid  advances  in  ML  coincides  with  a 
similarly transformative era for biological collections, espe-
cially  in  global  change  research.  Motivated  by  widespread 
museum  digitization  initiatives,  herbarium  specimens  are 
increasingly being used in a variety of new ways in research 
(Meineke et al. 2018a, Hedrick et al. 2020) and in the effec-
tive  engagement  of  the  public  through  citizen  science  and 
education (e.g., Lacey et al. 2017). In the present article, we 
focused on phenology because phenological inference is an 
emerging tool with links to adaptation, population success, 
ecophysiology, carbon and nutrient dynamics, human health 
and  sociocultural  applications,  and  resource  management. 
Many of these efforts could be expanded or transformed by 
the application of ML tools built to automate tasks because 
the  approaches  described  above  can  be  applied  to  a  wide 
array of research questions. In particular, ML shows prom-
ise in the study of nonphenological traits, the study of plant 
interactions with nonplant taxa, and the engagement of the 
broader community to promote biodiversity literacy.

Nonphenological  traits.  Herbarium  specimens  are  rich  with 
phenotypic  data,  and  specimen  images  provide  the  poten-
tial for automated trait measurement. Specimens have long 
provided  morphological  characters  (e.g.,  leaf  shape,  repro-
ductive  structures)  used  to  identify  plant  taxa;  however, 
these  measurements  were  traditionally  limited  to  species-
level  trait  means  or  ranges  for  identification  purposes 
only.  Influenced  by  developments  in  functional  trait-based 
ecology  (e.g.,  Reich  2014)  and  advances  in  global  change 
biology,  specimen  phenotypes  are  being  used  for  studies 
of  evolutionary  and  ecological  change  at  large  taxonomic, 
temporal,  and  geographic  scales.  For  example,  phenotypic 
data from specimens have been used to quantify rapid leaf 
trait  evolution  in  invasive  species  following  introduction 
(Buswell et al. 2011) and to document changes in plant size 
as  a  result  of  human  harvesting  (Law  and  Salick  2005)  or 
climate change (Leger 2013). To scale up these studies, ML 
models could be developed and deployed to efficiently mea-
sure functional traits for thousands of herbarium specimens 
(high-throughput  phenotyping;  Gehan  and  Kellogg  2017). 
These  traits  could  include  leaf  morphometric  traits  (size, 
shape), plant size (height, area), and inflorescence and floral 
traits (size, number).

Species interactions.  Data on species interactions are currently 
sparse, but hypotheses in this area of global change research 
are central to ecology and evolutionary biology. Herbarium 
specimens  and  other  collections  provide  unique  opportu-
nities  to  quantify  interactions  across  time  and  over  large 
geographic  ranges  (Lees  et  al.  2011,  Meineke  et  al.  2018b). 
ML-based  approaches  have  the  potential  to  broaden  and 

Biologist’s Toolbox

deepen  the  scope  of  available  data  and  therefore  facilitate 
new  discoveries  with  applications  in  conservation,  ecol-
ogy, and other fields. For example, ML could automate the 
recognition of leaf mines, damage from herbivores, or plant 
diseases (Ferentinos 2018, Ingram et al. 2017).

Biodiversity literacy.  ML methods and ML-generated data can 
provide  educational  opportunities  beyond  what  is  possible 
with  specimens  alone.  ML  has  yet  to  be  widely  applied  in 
biodiversity education, but on the basis of work using spec-
imen-based  data  in  undergraduate  courses,  such  data  can 
provide  authentic  introductions  to  scientific  skill  building, 
biodiversity and data literacy, and workforce training (Lacey 
et al. 2017 and the references within it). Educators can also 
integrate  specimen  annotation  activities  into  coursework 
using online citizen science platforms such as Zooniverse. In 
addition, students can learn data management skills, investi-
gate research questions of their own design, and gain expe-
rience  with  data  analysis  and  visualization  when  working 
with  the  wealth  of  data  generated  from  ML.  Furthermore, 
it  is  possible  to  involve  students  in  more  technical  aspects 
of the ML workflow, such as model creation and validation. 
The application of ML to digital specimen data provides an 
engaging,  well  structured,  freely  available  introduction  to 
data science.

Conclusions
Machine  learning  offers  an  efficient  approach  to  collecting 
large  amounts  of  phenological  data  from  herbarium  speci-
mens.  When  combined  with,  for  example,  spatiotemporal 
data  extracted  from  specimen  labels  during  digitization, 
these  data  enable  discovery  of  phenological  patterns  on 
unprecedented  scales.  ML  models  can  annotate  thousands 
to millions of images in relatively short time spans, poten-
tially with greater reproducibility and in finer detail than is 
feasible  with  human  labor  alone.  Furthermore,  the  adapt-
ability of ML models can empower specimen-based research 
beyond  phenological  traits,  facilitating  myriad  avenues  of 
biological research.

Despite  these  clear  advantages,  applying  ML  to  speci-
men images has limitations and challenges, many of which 
could  be  overcome  through  research  and  development  in 
several key areas. First, training data sets must be developed 
through  continued  digitization  of  herbarium  specimens 
and annotation of specimen images. Second, research ques-
tions  such  as  those  in  table  1  must  be  addressed  to  ensure 
ML-based  methods  are  being  effectively  employed.  Third, 
greater  attention  must  be  paid  to  downstream  use  of  auto-
matically  generated  data.  Primary  concerns  include  map-
ping ML-produced data to existing standards (e.g., Darwin 
Core, the Plant Phenology Ontology) and linking these data 
to existing specimen data (Lendemer et al. 2019). Finally, to 
fully  realize  the  potential  of  ML  approaches  to  phenology 
and  biodiversity  science,  there  is  great  need  for  collabora-
tive cyberinfrastructure to manage large quantities of visual 
data,  including  the  development  of  an  interdisciplinary
