Floral induction (FI) in shoot apical meristems (SAM) is assumed to be triggered by antagonistic 
endogenous signals. In fruit trees, FI occurs in some SAM only and is determined by activating and 
inhibiting signals originating from leaves and fruit, respectively. We developed a model (SigFlow) to 
quantify on 3D structures the combined impact of such signals and distances at which they act on 
SAM. Signal transport was simulated considering a signal ‘attenuation’ parameter, whereas SAM 
fate was determined by probability functions depending on signal quantities. Model behaviour 
was assessed on simple structures before being calibrated and validated on a unique experimental 
dataset of 3D digitized apple trees with contrasted crop loads and subjected to leaf and fruit removal 
at different scales of tree organization. Model parameter estimations and comparisons of two signal 
combination functions led us to formulate new assumptions on the mechanisms involved: (i) the 
activating signal could be transported at shorter distances than the inhibiting one (roughly 50 cm vs 
1 m) (ii) both signals jointly act to determine FI with SAM being more sensitive to inhibiting signal 
than activating one. Finally, the genericity of the model is promising to further understand the 
physiological and architectural determinisms of FI in plants.

Timing and intensity of floral induction (FI) are key processes in plants that strongly determine their reproduc-
tive ability. Most of the fruit trees have the particularity to induce floral transition in meristems the year before 
 flowering1 and in part of the meristems,  only2. FI usually takes place in spring when fruit growth also occurs, 
which can in turn affect vegetative growth and the proportion of meristems that are floral induced. The most 
known illustrations of this potential conflict between growth and FI are biennial bearing and masting that are 
associated with one year of high flowering intensity following one or many years of low fruit  load3. Moreover, 
within a tree canopy, meristems are subjected to contrasted conditions due to variations in microclimate, shoot 
polymorphism or fruit  location4. Such variations in local conditions can affect flowering as shown by the positive 
correlation between shoot length and  FI5,6, or by the decreasing proportion of FI in fruiting tree  parts7. Several 
hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existing within-tree and between years variability in  FI2,8. Among 
them, the competition for carbon under high crop load conditions could explain FI inhibition. This assumption is 
consistent with the differential expressions of genes involved in carbon metabolism between meristems of apple 
trees subjected to defruited or fruited  conditions9. Nevertheless, experimental findings have proved that the tree 
carbon economy is not directly involved in FI control in  apple10. Another assumption, based on seedless varieties, 
considers that FI is probably affected by inhibiting signals produced by seeds of fruit, mainly  gibberellins11 (GA). 
Other molecules could also be implicated to activate FI such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein produced 
by leaves and considered as the  florigen8,12.

In a previous  study10 the impact of leaf and fruit presence on within-tree FI variability was investigated in 
‘Golden Delicious’ cv. Results confirmed the existence of promoting and inhibiting signals, originating from 
leaves and fruit respectively. This study also showed (i) that FI was determined not only by the local conditions at 
the shoot scale but also by the fruit number and leaf area in the neighborhood and (ii) that the intensity of these 
signals strongly decreases with the distance between meristems and emitting sources. Finally and consistent with

suggested. This previous  study10 provided a strong experimental background from which it could be possible to 
infer and quantify the respective effect of inhibiting and activating signals in the within tree variability in FI, as 
well as their combined effects and the distance at which the emitting organs can act.

Mathematical models applied to plant growth and development are promising tools to analyze the impact 
of hidden processes not directly accessible from experiments through model parameter fitting procedures and 
subsequent interpretation of parameter  values14. In the current case of analysis of the within-tree variability 
in FI, functional structural plant models appear highly  relevant15. They can combine an explicit description of 
plant architecture (topology and organ geometry) together with the simulation of transport of different types of 
molecules (water, carbon, hormones, etc.). These models rely on mathematical formalisms developed to describe 
and simulate plant architectural development such as multi-scale  representation16, strings of customized plant 
modules in L-Systems17 or  graphs18. Within-plant fluxes or molecule transports have been modeled in FSPM 
with a special consideration on carbon  allocation19. It is usually assumed that assimilates are allocated depending 
on sink demand and distances between sources and sinks with an impact of distances modulated by empirical 
 resistances20–22. More mechanistic models are based on an electric analogy for describing carbohydrate move-
ments within the  phloem23 or include a mechanistic modeling of coupled phloem/xylem  transport24. Signal 
fluxes within plants have also been modelled, especially for the simulation of basipetal auxin transport and its 
consequence on bud  outgrowth25,26 on small single stem plants, without complex branching system (Arabidop-
sis thaliana, pea). In apple tree, initial models have been proposed to simulate inhibiting and activating signal 
transports and their consequences on  FI27,28. By changing manually signal quantity thresholds inducing FI, 
these models were promising to represent biennial bearing. However, they were not calibrated on observed data.
In this study, we built a model that simulates transports of both inhibiting and activating signals in 3D branch-
ing structures with the aim to further analyze the determinants of FI in fruit trees. This model was adapted from 
two previous ones, for carbon  allocation29 and for bidirectional  transport28. The model assumes a decrease in 
signal quantity with the distances from the emitting sources. FI in shoot apical meristems (SAM) was simulated 
based on inhibition and activation probability laws depending on both the quantity of inhibiting and activating 
signals. By fitting the model to a unique dataset on 3D digitized apple trees manipulated for their number of 
leaves and  fruit10, we quantified the combined impact of such signals and distances at which they act on SAM 
and explored the underlying mechanisms that could explain within tree variability in FI.

Material and methods
Model  overview.  The  model  (SigFlow)  was  developed  in  python  and  uses  libraries  from  the  OpenAlea 
 platform30. The model runs on 3D tree architectures coded in Multiscale Tree  Graphs16 (MTG) with three scales 
(tree, stem segments and metamers) and augmented with organ 3D  coordinates31. Segments are the parts of the 
stem between two branching points or one branching point and the axis extremity. Metamers are represented 
for the stem segments corresponding to the most recent shoots only and are composed of one leaf, one inter-
node and an inflorescence if present (Supplementary Fig. S1). Fruit and leaves produce signals moving within 
the structure depending on the distance with an ‘attenuation’ parameter that can be tuned in order to simulate 
different signal distributions i.e. homogeneity within the structure or local supply. These signals reach SAM and 
determine their fate with probabilities depending on signal quantities. FI is simulated on the SAM located in 
terminal position of annual shoots. In its current version the model runs on static tree structures, consistent with 
our modeling aim since FI usually occurs after the end of shoot vegetative growth in adult apple  trees32.

inhibiting and activating signal quantities and transport.  Equations for signal transport (inhibiting 
and activating) between annual shoots and SAM were adapted from previous studies dedicated to carbon allo-
cation between sources and  sinks20,29. These formalisms consider carbon allocation as dependent on distances 
between sources and sinks and on sink strength values depending on organ type and age. In our case, SAM are 
considered as target organs for inhibiting and activating signal with similar abilities to accumulate inhibiting or 
activating signal whatever the SAM. Annual shoots are considered as sources of inhibiting and activating sig-
nals originating from fruit and leaves, respectively. The quantity of signal originated from each annual shoot is 
computed as the sum of signals coming from each individual fruit and leaf in a given shoot. Since the equation 
previously  proposed29 considered relative values of sink strength, the signal distribution from each annual shoot 
was rewritten to account for similar SAM abilities to accumulate signals as follows:

where n is the number of SAM in a tree, qij is the quantity of signal exported by annual shoots (inhibiting or

topological pathway between i and j and r an ‘attenuation’ parameter modulating the distance effect. For r values 
close to 0, the signal is equally distributed within the structure whereas it is transported at shorter distance when r 
values increases (Fig. 1a). Assuming that r can be different depending on the type of signal considered (inhibiting 
or activating signal), we defined two parameters, r−, r+ for the inhibiting and activating signal, respectively. We 
considered a normalized value equal to 1 for the inhibiting signal produced by each fruit. In order to account 
for a possible effect of the variations in leaf area between shoots on FI, we set the quantity of activating signal 
as equal to shoot leaf area. For consistency with the parameters associated with inhibiting signals, variables and

by the mean shoot leaf area observed in trees.

After computations of fluxes, the quantity of signal (Supplementary Fig. S2) reaching each SAM j (QF,j) is 
then computed as the total quantity of signal originated from all the sources including the shoot bearing the

Distances between SAMs and shoots are computed based on the organ topological position and 3D coordi-

topological path as the sum of the Euclidean distances between (i) the base and the barycenter of each annual 
shoot, (ii) plus the distances between the successive bases of the plant components and the SAMs (iii) plus the 
distance between the base of the annual shoot bearing the SAM and its  extremity29.

Model behavior assessment on simple structures.  The model was applied to simple tree structures 
to analyze model consistency and sensitivity to parameter values. The first structure consisted of a branch com-
posed of six shoots equidistant from each other, bearing or not leaves or fruit. Here, we aimed at testing the effect 
of the signal ‘attenuation’ parameter (r−, r+) on the quantity of signal reaching SAMs located at different distances 
from signal sources.

The second structure consisted of two complete branches with different spatial distributions of fruit and 
leaves. In the first case, fruit and leaf distributions were similar in the two branches, with half of the shoots bear-
ing either fruit or leaves. In the second case, all the fruit or leaves were located on one branch only and the other 
one was completely either defruited or defoliated. Here we aimed at testing a wide range of signal ‘attenuation’ 
(r−, r+) and ‘transition’ parameter (t−, t+) values in order to evaluate the intertwined effects created by the model, 
between tree architecture, signal transport and SAM sensitivity to the quantity of signals.

Lastly, we analyzed model formalisms (“limiting factor”, “multiplicative formalism”; Eqs. 4 and 5) used to 
integrate the combined effects of inhibiting and activating signals on SAM FI. We used a structure composed of 
four contrasted branches, i.e. a leafy and fruiting branch, a foliated branch without fruit, a fruiting branch without 
leaf and a defoliated and non-fruiting branch. The two formalisms were used with a wide range of ‘transition’ 
values (t−, t+) to modify SAM sensitivity to both signals.

Description of the experimental dataset.  Data used for building the tree 3D representations and for 
calibration and validation purpose were taken from experiments carried out in 2017 on 10-year-old apple trees 
(cv. ‘Golden Delicious’) orchard, located at the SudExpé experimental station in Marsillargues, in the south of 
France (43° 66′ N 4° 18′ E). In this experiment described in Belhassine et al.10, leaves and/or fruit were removed 
in different parts of the tree (Supplementary Fig. S2). On trees set in ON (high fruit load) or OFF (crop load 
close to 0) conditions, fruit or leaves were removed on half of the shoots and half of the branches of trees trained 
as “solaxe” (one main vertical trunk) and on one side of trees with a Y-Shape (two main trunks). An additional 
set of trees not subjected to fruit or leaf removal but displaying a natural variability in crop load were observed 
during three years (2015–2016–2017).

SAM FI proportion in trees was estimated at full bloom in the spring following treatment onset, as the ratio 
of the total number of reproductive buds to the total number of growing buds in the different parts of the trees

displaying TCSA values (20.4 and 24.7 cm2, for solaxe and Y-Shape trees, respectively) close to the mean values 
observed in the orchard. 3D coordinates were acquired using an electromagnetic 3D digitizer (3Space Fastrak; 
Polhemus Inc., Colchester, VT, USA) at the trunk base, branching points and top and bases coordinates of each 
annual shoot (Supplementary Fig. S1). The 3D structures, including tree entities organized in three topological 
scales and their coordinates, were saved in MTG format. These structures were used to reconstruct leaf loca-
tion and area along annual shoots and to reproduce in silico experimental treatments of leaf and fruit removal. 
Leaf area distribution along annual shoots was reconstructed based on allometric relationships as previously 
 proposed34 (Supplementary Methods S1). To build allometric relationships, data were collected on both 60 short 
(< 5 cm) and long shoots (> 5 cm) and individual leaf areas were estimated with a leaf area meter (LI 3100 Area

and its final FI probability combining both signals (Pj). Parameters associated with either activating or inhibiting 
signal effects on FI were estimated separately on leaf and fruit removal treatments, respectively. Activating signal 
parameters  (r+,  t+,  v+)  were  estimated  on  non-fruiting  structures  subjected  to  leaf  removal  at  different  scales 
(shoot, branch, and half-tree) or not (control OFF trees). Inhibiting signal parameters (r−, t−, v−) were estimated 
on leafy and fruiting tree structures subjected to fruit removal at different scales (shoot, branch and half-tree) 
or not (control ON trees) and on leafy non-fruiting trees (control OFF trees). Simulated FI proportions (i.e. 
proportion of meristems that were floral induced) were compared to the observed FI ones in the different parts 
of the trees (leafy or non-leafy, fruiting or non-fruiting). Simulated proportions were computed as the average 
FI probability of each bud in the different parts of the trees. The parameter values of the simulation displaying 
the lowest error between simulated and observed FI for all conditions (tree and local treatments) were selected 
as the best solution in the calibration procedure. Two steps in the calibration procedure were done. A first step 
consisted in exploring a wide range of values by varying r+ and r− from 0 to 15 (step = 0.1), t+, t− from 0 to 1 
(step = 0.1) and v+ and v− between 0.01, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 for activating and inhibiting signals respectively (6,644 
simulations in total). In a second step, the range of values close to the best solutions was narrowed down to refine 
estimations (1,155 simulations).

Model validations were performed in two steps. First, the two sets of parameter values for activating and 
inhibiting signals obtained from calibration were used to simulate FI probability in fruiting trees subjected to leaf 
removal. The two functions which represent the combined effect of both signals on SAM FI, i.e. with a “limiting 
factor” or a multiplicative formalism, were compared through simulated SAM FI proportions. Second, valida-
tions were performed on the digitized “solaxe” tree on which contrasted crop loads were obtained by in-silico 
fruit removal. FI proportions simulated for these different in silico crop loads were compared to the relationship 
between FI and crop load obtained from the additional trees displaying contrasting crop load in the experiment.
Model calibration and validation quality was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), bias (absolute 

sum of differences divided by replicate number) and  R2 between observed and simulated values.

Results
Model behavior and sensitivity to model parameters.  The ‘attenuation’ parameter of the inhibiting 
signal (r−) was varied on a simple structure composed of six shoots located at an equal distance from each other 
(15 cm) and with three sources (fruit) (Fig. 2a). When no signal ‘attenuation’ (r− = 0) was considered, inhibit-
ing signal was equally transported to the six SAMs (Fig. 2b): each one had an inhibiting signal value equal to 
0.5 which represented the number of fruits divided by the SAM number. When r− values were increased, the 
quantity of inhibiting signal reaching each meristem (Q−
F) increased and decreased in SAM of fruiting and non-
fruiting shoots, respectively. For the highest values of r− (roughly over 15) Q−
F was equal to 0 in the SAM of non-
fruiting shoot and 1 in the ones of fruiting shoots. When considering medium values of r−, differences between 
fruiting and non-fruiting shoot resulted from the distance of each shoot to the other ones. Among non-fruiting 
shoots, the ranking of Q−
F in SAM depended on its distance to all fruit, with SAM of shoot 3 (sum of distances 
to the fruit = 45 cm) displaying the highest quantity, SAM 6 (90 cm) the lowest and SAM 5 (75 cm) a medium 
value. Similarly, SAM 1 and 2 of fruiting shoots displayed higher Q−
F than SAM 4 because they were located 
close to each other and could exchange inhibiting signal. In another simulation set, the sources of activating 
(leaves) signals were varied on the same simple structure considering leafy and non-leafy shoots to analyze the 
effect of attenuation parameter associated with activating signal (r+) on activating signal quantity in SAM (Q+
F, 
Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar results for the signal quantities variations in SAM were obtained since model 
assumptions are symmetric for both inhibiting and activating signals.

The impact of the signal ‘attenuation’ (r−) and ‘transition’ parameters (t−) on SAM floral induction probability 
depending on inhibiting signal (P−) was assessed on simple structures composed of two branches with contrasted 
location of fruit (random fruit removal on both branches, Fig. 3d; one fruiting and one non-fruiting branch, 
Fig. 3a). On the two structures and except for  r− = 0 (homogeneous distribution of signal between each SAM), 
P− was higher in SAM located on non-fruiting branches or shoots than in SAM located in fruiting branches or 
shoots (Fig. 3b,c). The contrast in P− between fruiting branches/shoots and non-fruiting ones increased when 
r− values increased due to a transport of the inhibiting signal at shorter distances (Fig. 3b,c) Moreover, the 
contrast in P− between fruiting and non-fruiting parts was lower when fruit were removed randomly on both 
branches (Fig. 3e,f) than when removal was performed at the branch scale (Fig. 3b,c). This results from the lower 
distances between fruiting and non-fruiting shoots when fruit removal was performed on half of the shoots than 
between fruiting and non-fruiting branches when fruit removal was performed at the branch scale. The effect 
of t− parameter (indicating the signal quantity threshold for which P− was equal to 50%), was consistent with 
its expected impact as P− increases when t- increases. As expected from model equations, P− was equal to 1 in 
all conditions when t− was equal to 1. Model behavior was similar when considering the impact of leaf removal 
at different scales (shoot or branch, Supplementary Fig. S4) on floral induction probability associated with the 
activating signal (P+) on the same two-branches structures subjected to leaf removal since model hypotheses for 
inhibiting and activating signal are similar.

F) in six meristems for different values of the signal ‘attenuation’ 
parameter (r−) (b). Simulations were performed on a simple structure composed of six shoots and three fruit, 
each shoot being located at 15 cm from each other (a). 1, 2 and 4 are fruiting shoots and 3, 5 and 6 are non-
fruiting shoots.

Simulations were then performed to analyze model behavior when effects both of leaves and fruit are taken 
into account. In these simulations, resulting FI probabilities (P) were calculated by either the function assuming 
a limiting-factor (Supplementary Fig. S5) or the multiplicative (Fig. 4) formalism on simple structures com-
posed of four branches bearing leaves and fruit or not. In these simulations, signal (inhibiting and activating) 
transport could occur between branches to simulate some inhibiting and activating signal quantities in non-
fruiting and non-leafy branches, respectively. When medium values for ‘transition’ parameters (t− = t+ = 0.5) 
were considered, P was, as expected, the highest in non-fruiting and leafy branches, i.e. in presence of activating 
signal and in absence of inhibiting one, whatever the chosen function (multiplicative, Fig. 4 or limiting factor 
formalism, Supplementary Fig. S5). For the three other branch configurations and whatever the formalism, P 
were low due to either high inhibiting signal quantity in fruiting branches (Fig. 4b, 1,3; Supplementary Fig. S5b, 
1,3) or low activating signal quantity in non-leafy branches (Fig. 4b, 3,4; Supplementary Fig. S5b, 1,3). When 
varying the transition parameter values, lower P were simulated by the multiplicative formalism than by the 
limiting factor one. This was mainly observed for fruiting and foliated branches (Fig. 4b, 1 and Supplementary 
Fig. S5b, 1) and non-fruiting and defoliated branches (Fig. 4b, 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5b, 4) when  t− < 0.7 
and  t+ > 0.3, respectively. In those cases, an additional effect on P of the less-limiting factor (activating signal in 
foliated branches, or inhibiting signal in non-fruiting branches) was simulated by the multiplicative formalism. 
This effect was due to fruit presence in neighboring branches in the non-fruiting branches or leaf absence in the 
neighborhood for the leafy ones.

Model calibrations and associated parameters values.  Model calibrations performed separately on 
trees with leaf or fruit removal were highly relevant when confronting observed and simulated FI proportions 
in the different parts of the trees subjected to local fruit and leaf removal (Fig. 5).  R2 and RMSE were equal to 
0.90 and 0.116 and 0.93 and 0.059, for the calibration performed on trees with leaf or fruit removal, respectively.
This calibration procedure resulted in a set of estimated parameters related to either activating or inhibiting 
signal. The estimated ‘transition’ parameter value (t, Table 1) was lower for the activating (0.09) than for the 
inhibiting signal (0.47), revealing that low quantities of activating signal were enough to trigger FI. The estimated 
signal ‘attenuation’ (r) value was higher for the activating signal (5.0) than for the inhibiting one (2.7). These 
values correspond to roughly less than 10% of the emitted signal reaching a SAM when located at more than 
0.5 m or 1.2 m from sources of activating and inhibiting signals (leaves and fruit), respectively (Supplementary 
Fig. S6). Estimated ‘shape’ parameter values were similar for both activating and inhibiting signals (0.25) and 
account for a noticeable uncertainty in SAM fate for a given quantity of signal. Indeed, although the ‘transition’ 
value for the inhibiting signal (0.47) represents the quantity of signal needed to reach a FI probability of 0.5, this

probability was equal to 0.27 when the quantity of inhibiting signal was high (0.75) and still remained non null 
(0.11) for an quantity of signal equal to 1 (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Distributions of simulated FI probability depending on the quantities of inhibiting and activating signals in 
the different SAMs of trees subjected to either leaf or fruit removal provided additional information about the 
underlying signal and distance effects FI probability in the different tree parts (Fig. 6). Inhibiting and activating 
signal quantity were slightly lower in leafy compared to non-leafy parts and in non-fruiting parts compared to 
fruiting ones when removals were performed at the shoot scale (Fig. 6a,b). These small differences were consistent 
with the observed low differences in FI proportion between leaf/non-leafy or fruiting/non-fruiting shoots and 
resulted from the short distances between neighboring shoots within tree structures. Among shoots of a given 
type (leafy, non-leafy, fruiting, non-fruiting), variations in the quantity of inhibiting and activating signals were 
quite low when treatments were performed at the shoot scale. This likely resulted from (i) the low variation in 
the observed individual shoot leaf areas (e.g. more than 75% of the shoots had leaf area between 80 and 120 cm2

(all shoots were considered as bearing one fruit in ON trees).

Differences in signal quantity (QF) between the different tree parts were stronger when organ removals were 
considered at coarser scales (branch or half-tree) with a greater impact of leaf/fruit removals on half-trees, con-
sistent with the increasing distances to the remaining fruit or leaves (Fig. 6c–f). These differences were of greater 
extent for leaf removal than for fruit removal due to the higher estimated signal ‘attenuation’ parameter value 
for the activating signal (r+) than for inhibiting one (r−) (Table 1). Nevertheless, and consistently with observed 
data, the simulated impact of leaf removal on FI probability was lower than that of fruit due to lower estimated 
‘transition’ parameter (t) values for the activating signal. Finally, quite large variability in signal quantities was 
obtained in the different SAMs of non-leafy (Q+
F) when treatments were performed 
at the branch or half tree scale. This variability probably resulted from the spatial distribution of SAM within the 
tree, with SAM at branch bases closer to the sources of signals coming from other branches than ones located

the range of variation in the observed FI proportions was low, with FI proportion close to 0 in all the treatments

Discussion
A model‑based approach for quantifying the respective roles of leaves and fruit on FI.  This 
study proposes a new model (SigFlow) that simulates for the first time FI variability in a fruit tree as the result 
of the combined effects of its architecture, inhibiting and activating signals and SAM sensitivity to these signals.

inhibiting and activating sources were artificially  modified10. It was also able to rebuild the relationship between 
tree crop load and the proportion of flowering SAMs in the next  year35. The model assumes that signal attenu-
ation is related to distances from emitting sources and that FI could be determined using probability functions 
depending on the combination of both signal quantities. It uses a generic formalism adapted for representing 
all types of plant architectures  (MTG16). The proposed model could thus be applied to other fruit tree species in 
which FI varies within the tree and between years (e.g. peach, olive, plum and walnut trees). This study focused 
on FI proportion in SAM located in terminal position on annual shoots and did not account for meristem fate 
in axillary position along medium and long shoots. This simplification is relevant for adult apple trees display-
ing short shoots  mainly36. In the case of younger trees or other fruit trees bearing buds in axillary positions 
(e.g. prunus sp.), our model would also be relevant for computing axillary flowering probability but it should be 
complemented with other sub-models to account for the position of axillary meristems in the flowering zones 
along the parent  shoot37. Generating potential floral zone in the tree structure could be achieved using statistical 
models, as done  previously38, or more mechanistically by simulating shoot growth dynamics within the growing 
 season39. Indeed, FI occurrence was observed to be associated with a decrease in plastochron and shoot growth 
 cessation40,41.

Previous models for simulating signal transport in plants were developed to represent basipetal auxin polar 
transport at short distances within monopodial  stem25,26. Our approach relied on a more general formalism previ-
ously proposed for source-sink models to represent fruit growth  variability21,22,29. In our model, no preferential 
direction in signal fluxes was assumed as previous studies showed that fruit and leaf influence occurs in both 
acropetal and basipetal  directions13. In this tree structure, the quantity of inhibiting signal produced by each 
fruit was assumed to be similar, since it is associated with a constant seed number per fruit (source of GA) for a 
given genotype. The quantity of activating signal was assumed to be associated with shoot leaf area values based 
on previous results showing the close relationship between shoot vigor or length and  FI6.

Parameter estimation leads to new assumptions on the physiological process involved in the 
within‑tree variability in floral induction.  A heuristic approach was carried out by adjusting parameter 
values (‘attenuation’, ‘transition’ and ‘shape’ parameters) to a set of experimental data. The estimated parameter 
values allowed us to propose new hypotheses explaining the within tree variability in FI in apple trees.

The signal ‘attenuation’ parameters represent the distance effect and the decrease in the influence of fruit and 
leaves. It could be associated with the rate of hormone or protein accumulation or degradation during their trans-
port from the emitting sources to  SAM42. The estimated values of ‘attenuation’ parameters were relatively higher 
for the activating signal than for the inhibiting one. This result is consistent with the relative short distance of the 
action of the florigen, i.e. FT protein, in fruit  trees43,44. Molecules other than FT could have an activating effect 
on FI. Among them sugar signaling molecules such as trehalose-6-phosphate were observed to affect flowering 
time in Arabidopsis thaliana by inducing FT  production45. The present study also provides quantitative support 
to the assumption of the relatively long-distance transport of an inhibiting signal originating from fruit that 
could correspond to a GA mobile form, especially GA12 that was observed to be transported in small  plants46,47. 
However, molecules other than GA could also be involved such as auxin that can act as a second messenger and 
can be transported over long  distances8.

The ‘transition’ parameter represents the sensitivity of SAMs to the quantity of signals they receive. The 
estimated values suggest that a low quantity of activating signal corresponding to 33 cm2 of shoot leaf area only

of shoot leaf areas observed in apple  tree48. This means that in most agronomic cases and for trees not subjected 
to any drastic defoliation, the quantity of signal produced by leaves does not limit FI. This result suggests to 
reinterpreting the observed positive correlation between shoot leaf area and  FI5,6. Increasing leaf area does not 
likely activate by itself FI. The relationship between shoot leaf area and FI could thus result from a longer distance 
between fruit and SAM that may in turn reduce inhibiting signal quantity reaching SAM. In apple trees, large 
genotypic variability in shoot length  exists49 that has been associated with a higher tendency to return bloom 
each year in cultivars bearing fruit on long shoots than those bearing only spurs (short shoots). Such relationships 
seem to disappear when exploring the variability within a segregating  population50. In that context, it is likely that 
each genotype may have different physiological regulations, for instance different quantity of inhibiting signal 
produced in relation for instance with the observed genotypic variability in seed number per  fruit51. The mod-
eling approach proposed, integrating both architectural and functional traits (quantity of signal, signal transport, 
meristem sensitivity), could be a promising way to explore the determinants of the genotypic variability in FI.

Model outputs support a combined effect of activating and inhibiting signals on FI since the multiplicative 
formalism, even though not stringent enough, was better at simulating FI in fruiting and non-leafy parts of the 
trees than the formalism based on a “limiting factor”. This can be interpreted as the likely implication of both 
signals in a common pathway responsible for FI. This assumption is consistent with previous studies showing an 
impact of GA on the floral pathway integrator SOC whose activity is also regulated by  FT52,53.

Finally, the high values of the shape parameter representing the level of uncertainty in the SAM FI for a 
given quantity of signals reveal some limitations of our modeling approach to represent FI within an apple tree 
structure. It is likely that the model hypotheses, assuming a role of leaves and fruit only, are not sufficient to 
represent all the complex processes involved in within tree variability in FI. Indeed several pathways are known 
to be involved, including climatic conditions, in particular  temperature54, which can be modified by the micro-
climate conditions within the canopy. Moreover, in our model we did not consider any preferential direction in 
signal fluxes (acropetal or basipetal) which could locally affect FI proportion. Although it is known that  GA46 
and  FT55 can move in the vascular xylem–phloem system, no results exist on a possible preferential transport 
for the signaling molecules (with the transpiration and water flux or with the phloem mass flow).

conclusion
In this study, we developed a new generic model (SigFlow) for simulating the transport of inhibiting and acti-
vating signals within tree structures that was calibrated using a unique set of experimental data in apple trees. 
Although the nature of the signal remains to be elucidated, the estimation of model parameter values and the 
comparisons of two signal combining functions allowed us to propose new assumptions regarding the respec-
tive influences of inhibiting and activating signals and the distance effects in the determination of FI. Model 
outputs support the hypothesis that inhibiting and activating signals interact to determine FI, with the SAM 
being more sensitive to inhibiting signal than activating one, and that fruit signals act at longer distances than 
leaves. Moreover, leaf area in actual agronomic conditions is likely non-limiting for FI. This model thus opens 
new perspectives to understand further the physiological and architectural determinants of FI in trees.
