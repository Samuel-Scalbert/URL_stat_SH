Abstract. The current state of the semantic web is focused on data. This is a worthwhile progress in web content processing
and interoperability. However, this does only marginally contribute to knowledge improvement and evolution. Understanding
the world, and interpreting data, requires knowledge. Not knowledge cast in stone for ever, but knowledge that can seamlessly
evolve; not knowledge from one single authority, but diverse knowledge sources which stimulate confrontation and robustness;
not consistent knowledge at web scale, but local theories that can be combined. We discuss two different ways in which semantic
web technologies can greatly contribute to the advancement of knowledge: semantic eScience and cultural knowledge evolution.

1. Life before the semantic web

Many animals are able to learn from their environment. This can be achieved through perceiving the
environment and experimenting with it: acting and learning from the results of actions. Some of these
animals learn from others. Most of them do it by mere imitations, such as birds learning songs [1].
However, it is known that some monkeys are able to signal danger and even that some other species can
learn the signal from others [2].

The resulting behaviour shared among a population is called culture. Culture encompasses know-how,

knowledge, languages, traditions, among other things, and does not have to be explicitly expressed.

Human beings are special among these species because they can express the knowledge1 that they

learn and communicate it to other human beings.

Bees can communicate how to reach food sources in an articulated language, but this stunning ca-
pability seems to be ﬁxed. Direct knowledge communication is a very powerful mechanism because it
leads to transmit knowledge without having to relearn it from experience. This capability grew slowly
and led to teaching, monasteries, universities, and conferences.

Besides articulated expression, written expression and communication have allowed to get rid of time
and space in knowledge transmission. Through tablets, rolls, books, libraries, or scholar journals it is
possible to build on someone else knowledge without even meeting.

1In this paper, knowledge is not opposed to belief, but to data, as customary in the ﬁeld of knowledge representation. Thus,
we are not focusing on the epistemological status of statements, but on their form. Knowledge is concerned with general
statements; data with particular statements.

This led to a variety of ways to acquire knowledge: by observing and experimenting, by imitating, by
communicating (talking, writing, reading). These key features have provided a selective advantage to
the human species. This has been more eloquently storytold [3].

The worldwide web, facilitating cultural exchange, is a culminating point in this story, so far. One
initial achievement of the web has been to make knowledge more easily and readily accessible across
the planet. Knowledge was expressed in a not-very different way than before: through natural language
texts and pictures, later through movies, interpretable by human beings. Those who have experienced
the transition of the world before and after the web can only be grateful. The ease of use of the web
pushed knowledgeable people all over the world to provide worldwide access to their knowledge. In this
respect, wikipedia and stackoverﬂow in which millions of individuals care about articulating what they
know for others, are just two but wonderful and precious successes.

Hence, a semantic web [4, 5], allowing machines to grasp this knowledge, is a tremendous idea.

2. The data advent: a little semantics went a long way... but may remain stuck here

The semantic web could be characterised by one of its early slogans: a web for machines. Not only for
humans, but also for machines. The web was already processed by machine, but its content was aimed at
being interpreted by human beings. More precisely it meant that the content of the web would be more
machine processable.

However, there may be various understanding of ‘content’. It could be metadata: a set of attributes
that help web search and classiﬁcation. It could be precise data that is interpreted by speciﬁc programs,
e.g. calendars or software dependencies. It could be relatively general knowledge representations of the
content, such as causal relations or universal statements. Technologies developed by the W3C Semantic
web activity covered these three aspects.

The semantic web did not immediately took off. This is not particularly surprising, but in our world in
which everything has to change fast, this is considered a shortcoming. In particular, though enthusiastic
scholars had been eager to develop sophisticated representations or ontologies, these were instantiated
with little data. Hence of little practical use.

It was necessary to provide data to this semantic web because no one was interested by a bunch of
theorem provers. Fortunately, by that time, the web was not short of data. Linked data [6], building on
semantic web technologies, was welcome to beneﬁt from these data and semantic web technologies. The
linked data trend was spot on as it met other trends such as openness, big data, and later, data ﬂow from
the internet of things. Governments supported the process to connect data sources of administrations.
Companies competed to acquire giant meshes of data on which they could run cleverly engineered
pieces of software to learn what was there.

Moreover, data is the fuel for the knowledge mill. The availability of data, and computing power,
unleashed the amazing capabilities of data analytics and machine learning from these data. This made
some sense on top of raw data, that which can lead to impressive applications. Hence, it effectively
contributes to make the web more intelligible to machines [7].

Nowadays, web users are not expected to provide knowledge, nor to access it. It seems that they are
mere data provider, mostly through their actions, e.g. click, buy, like. These data are machine process-
able, but not open. They are kept secret, in silos, to the exclusive exploitation of a single organisation.
They are processed by corporations which eventually learn knowledge from that data. But this knowl-
edge, in turn, is not shared nor even prone to be communicated because not necessarily expressed in an
articulated language. Instead, it is directly actioned. Hence, knowledge does not improve.

3. For knowledge!

After twenty years, the semantic web ﬁeld is mostly focused on data, even when it is made of so-called

knowledge graphs.

Of course, schemata and vocabularies are used. But, they are most of the time used for helping ma-
chines to parse data. Most of them simply express the structure and eventual relations between entities,
but not what we know about them. Hence, the interpretation of data relies on the system after parsing.
Knowledge is not made explicit nor shared; it is not available for scrutiny, reuse or evolution.

A semantic web without knowledge is for machines like a map without a legend for humans. The lack
of a legend does not prevent to distinguish a road from a river, a bridge from a boat shuttle. But it does
not help understanding how these can be used to travel. It does not enable the explorer to plan her trip,
by reasoning on elevation or humidity.

Hence, this seems like a regression which brings us down the knowledge evolution ladder: humanity

may eventually be fed with data, but any knowledge will have to be learnt again and again.

This is why the grand goal of formally expressing knowledge on the web must be rehabilitated. One
ambition of the semantic web was to make knowledge available to machines, so that at least they can help
us work with this knowledge, not only to ﬁnd it out but to process it, to improve it and to communicate
it to the world [7], as the next knowledge medium [8]. This could have led to a further knowledge
ecosystem in which knowledge is elaborated while it is used for providing services. Like the web can
be seen as a data washing machine [9], all the knowledge of the web, may be used to clean up and
to improve knowledge. Reconsidering knowledge sharing and evolution at web scale would empower
humans and machines alike with knowledge that can be both used to provide services and jointly reﬁned
and elaborated.

The goal is not to build the all-encompassing ontology with which everyone will agree. Knowledge
does not have to be centralised: diversity is source of disputation and robustness. Knowledge is not cast
in stone for ever, but it has to seamlessly evolve. Knowledge need not be consistent at web scale, it can
come in local theories that can be combined.

The semantic web initiative has already provided a good basis for expressing and sharing knowledge.
First, universal and well-deﬁned languages such as RDF, RDFS, OWL, or SPARQL have been designed
and reliable implementations exist. Then many specialised ontologies using these technologies have been
developed from the most abstract, e.g. work, provenance, to the more concrete, e.g. proteins, scientiﬁc
articles.

In the remainder, two different aspects are considered: how explicitly sharing formalised knowledge
contributes to improve scientiﬁc practices, hence our shared knowledge; how knowledge, shared or not,
may be seamlessly evolved and how this can be studied in an effective way. Of course, these direc-
tions are not without connection and not the only possible ones. However, they are in a totally different
position with respect to the current state of the semantic web.

4. eScience: an example of web of knowledge

Let us take a typical example of collaborative knowledge elaboration, sharing and evolution: scientiﬁc

research. eScience is a paramount example of knowledge expression and evolution.

Science has not been left aside of the professional computerisation: it has been very active from this
standpoint. Statistical packages, plotting and editing notebooks are now commonplace and in silico

66

Jérôme Euzenat / A map without a legend: The semantic web and knowledge evolution

simulations are accepted. This facilitates the production, analysis and dissemination of knowledge by
and for humans helped by machines. Meanwhile, little is made for helping machines to have a grasp at
the content.

Semantic eScience is a further step in that direction [10]. It exploits semantic web technologies to
provide an interoperable and machine-interpretable infrastructure for scientiﬁc enquiry. Within the past
10 years, it has been a continuing source of attention.

Necessary technologies are already in place for metadata and identiﬁcation: IRIs provide a natural
way to identify entities such as researchers (ORCID) or documents (DOI). Support has been provided to
express bibliographic data in RDF [11]. This allows expressing metadata about scientiﬁc literature.

On the content side, i.e. the objects of scientiﬁc statements, there are already many resources to ex-
press these with semantic web technologies. In life and health sciences, Gene ontology, OBO Foundry,
bioportal, and Bio2RDF were already there 10 years ago and continuously improved [12]. On the math-
ematical side, efforts have been made to provide ways to offer a semantic encoding [13].

It is also possible to deal with the methodological aspect of research. Some work have proposed the
expression of hypotheses [14]. On the experimental side: the researchobject project has provided a way
to describe protocols [15]. Attempts are made to describe evaluation methods [16]. Finally, efforts have
been made to address open science requirements to publish data sets. Google dataset search [17] offers
search among data sets described with schema.org dataset and DCAT. Relations between such elements
—which process produced which data, what hypothesis is it supposed to support, in which paper has it
been published— can be kept track of through provenance assertions [18].

All this allows for expressing scientiﬁc knowledge on the web, not only the results of scientiﬁc enquiry
but the whole process that led to establish such results. Hence, ingredients for semantic scientiﬁc research
are available. What is missing is that scientiﬁc practices embrace semantic web technologies. This can
come from more integration in work habits and new applications providing beneﬁts. Here are a few
example of these.

Scientiﬁc knowledge expressed with semantic web technologies would clearly facilitate searching
results [19]. However, more can be obtained from it with the help of machines. Knowledge expressed
formally on the web could lead to formal scientiﬁc collaboratories [20]. For instance, data analysis work-
ﬂows can be exploited for continuous reevaluation of hypotheses by updating data analyses when new
data is available [21]. It may be checked, beforehand, that an experiment is prone to refute a claim. Pa-
pers whose results contradict one another could be identiﬁed. On the mathematical side, proof checking,
now performed at the scale of one theory may be attempted at larger scales. Experiments testing a partic-
ular hypothesis, or a more speciﬁc one, can be found to avoid duplication. A protocol may be analysed
to pinpoint what should be changed to affect the results of experiments. Literature can be exploited to
predict averse effects [22]. More simply, machine learning could help cleaning and mining result as well
as suggesting interesting tracks. These applications require knowledge and cannot rely on data alone.

In addition to contributing to open research, semantic expression of research processes may help
addressing reproducibility issues. Providing accurate descriptions of computer-based experiments can
allow a computer to reproduce them. Tools may be developed to help (debugging and) peer-reviewing
experiment preregistrations. They may also help to identify missing information in descriptions and so
even facilitate off-line reproducibility.

This is where full knowledge can play its role, by enabling machines to help us improving our knowl-
edge by confronting it to existing data, by ﬁnding contradiction with other pieces of knowledge, by
learning from data and knowledge. Machines could then join the course of knowledge evolution adding
value to knowledge and massively confronting it.

5. Evolving knowledge

Knowledge, whether expressed on the web or not, whether generated through eScience or not, must
evolve. Knowledge that does not evolve, and systems based on it, are at risk of obsolescence. If the
semantic web is to be more than a parenthesis in supporting the knowledge of humanity, efforts should
be made for ensuring its smooth and continuous evolution.

Semantic eScience can contribute to this, but is not sufﬁcient. Human knowledge evolves indepen-
dently from scientiﬁc research, which is a relatively recent way to deal with knowledge. Contrary to
science, people do not necessarily elaborate knowledge for itself, but evolve it through its use. However,
both processes contribute to ‘improve’ knowledge and evolutionary interpretations of science are not
new [23].

Natural selection can be thought of as a simple control mechanism based on variation, selection and
transmission [24]. This can be implemented in computers as had already been done for genetic program-
ming [25]. Concerning human knowledge, anthropology identiﬁed and studied cultural evolution [26].
Thus one way of addressing the problem of knowledge evolution is through understanding how cultural
evolution techniques may be adapted to the semantic web.

Experimental cultural evolution as been successfully applied to natural language [27]. It is perfectly
reasonable to apply experimental cultural evolution to knowledge [28]. Knowledge generates individual
behaviour, which is subject to selective pressure from the environement and thus spreads differentially.
Knowledge evolution can indeed be implemented as a mechanism that makes knowledge evolve seam-
lessly while it is used.

Experiments have been performed with knowledge-carrying agents adapting minimally their knowl-
edge when it reveals inadequate. The behaviour of such agents becomes more coherent as more inter-
actions are performed. Like in cultural evolution, knowledge transmission does not necessarily happen
through inheritance. On the contrary, agents may transmit knowledge by cooperating or by directly
exchanging it. Such minimal distributed social mechanisms for evolving and shaping knowledge are
desirable features for social machines [29].

Experimental cultural evolution has been adapted to evolve abstract cultures [30], natural language
features [27], and, closer to the semantic web, ontology alignments. In particular, it can be used to repair
alignments better than blind logical repair [31], to create alignments based on entity descriptions [32], to
learn alignments from dialogues framed in interaction protocols [33, 34], or to correct alignments until
no error remains and to start with no alignment [35, 36]. Each study provides new insights and opens
directions on the effects of local reactive adaptation on the resulting knowledge.

There are two important challenges to provide evolvability to the semantic web knowledge: under-
standing cultural knowledge evolution and embedding it within the semantic web. Contrary to the situ-
ation described for eScience: the task is not to merely use and spread semantic web technologies, but to
properly extend them.

Cultural knowledge evolution principles may be studied by following the path of experimental cultural
evolution presented above or developing more theoretical approaches. Many challenging questions are
yet unanswered. For instance, the formation and evolution of common knowledge, i.e. proper culture,
must be studied. Another relevant issue is the co-evolution of knowledge learnt from the environment
and knowledge acquired through communication.

Concerning web integration, we are back in the read-write web debate: as long as agents are reduced
to knowledge consumers, only top-down evolution is possible; as soon as they become proper learners,

68

i.e. able to evolve and communicate the knowledge they learn, a more lively evolution is possible. This
requires these agents, human or software applications, to expose and adapt the knowledge they use.

6. Conclusions

The semantic web endeavour has so far provided impressive outcomes in terms of linked data, which
can be interpreted by machines, as well as representation languages and ontologies. This is only the
beginning of the journey towards a semantic web contributing to the knowledge of humanity. A solid
basis is available that should be pushed further.

Human beings shape their culture and knowledge progressively through evolution. The current em-
phasis of the semantic web towards data undermines this enterprise. Knowledge learnt from data is not
made explicit nor communicated. Hence, it cannot properly evolve, but has to be relearnt.

For the semantic web to take its full part in knowledge advancement, it has to be complemented
by explicit knowledge expression and sharing. This would unleash the capability to properly evolve
knowledge as illustrated by work on two directions: (a) scientiﬁc knowledge elaboration processes may
be improved by expressing them semantically, and (b) knowledge on the web may be evolved smoothly
through evolutionary techniques.
