Abstract 
Precision feeding (PF) aims to provide the right amount of nutrients at the right time for each animal. Lactating sows generally receive the same 
diet, which either results in insufficient supply and body reserve mobilization, or excessive supply and high nutrient excretion. With the help of 
online measuring devices, computational methods, and smart feeders, we introduced the first PF decision support system (DSS) for lactating 
sows. Precision (PRE) and conventional (STD) feeding strategies were compared in commercial conditions. Every day each PRE sow received a 
tailored ration that had been computed by the DSS. This ration was obtained by blending a diet with a high AA and mineral content (13.00 g/kg 
SID Lys, 4.50 g/kg digestible P) and a diet low in AAs and minerals (6.50 g/kg SID Lys, 2.90 g/kg digestible P). All STD sows received a conven-
tional diet (10.08 g/kg SID Lys, 3.78 g/kg digestible P). Before the trial, the DSS was fitted to farm performance for the prediction of piglet average 
daily gain (PADG) and sow daily feed intake (DFI), with data from 1,691 and 3,712 lactations, respectively. Sow and litter performance were 
analyzed for the effect of feeding strategy with ANOVA, with results considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. The experiment involved 
239 PRE and 240 STD sows. DFI was similarly high in both treatments (PRE: 6.59, STD: 6.45 kg/d; P = 0.11). Litter growth was high (PRE: 2.96, 
STD: 3.06 kg/d), although it decreased slightly by about 3% in PRE compared to STD treatments (P < 0.05). Sow body weight loss was low, 
although it was slightly higher in PRE sows (7.7 vs. 2.1 kg, P < 0.001), which might be due to insufficient AA supply in some sows. Weaning to 
estrus interval (5.6 d) did not differ. In PRE sows SID Lys intake (PRE: 7.7, STD: 10.0 g/kg; P < 0.001) and digestible P intake (PRE: 3.2, STD: 3.8 g/
kg; P < 0.001) declined by 23% and 14%, respectively, and feed cost decreased by 12%. For PRE sows, excretion of N and P decreased by 28% 
and 42%, respectively. According to these results, PF appears to be a very promising strategy for lactating sows.

Lay Summary 
In lactating sows, nutrient requirements among individual animals vary greatly. With a single diet, lactating sows are likely to be either underfed, 
which results in body reserve mobilization, or overfed, which results in nutrient excretion. Precision feeding (PF) is a new feeding strategy that 
aims to provide the right amount of nutrients at the right time for each animal. In this study, we focus on the implementation and the evaluation 
of a decision support system (DSS) that delivers daily tailored diets to lactating sows. Two experimental treatments were compared: a precision 
feeding strategy based on the DSS (PRE treatment; 239 sows), and a conventional feeding strategy (STD treatment; 240 sows). Digestible 
lysine intake and digestible phosphorus intake were reduced by 23% and 14% in PRE sows, respectively, and feed cost by 12%, compared to 
STD sows. Excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus also decreased for PRE sows by 28% and 42%, respectively. Sow body weight loss was low, 
although slightly higher in PRE sows, which might be due to insufficient amino acid supply in some sows. PF appears to be a very promising 
strategy for matching nutrient supply to the specific nutrient requirements of lactating sows.

Introduction
The feeding of lactating sows is of economic importance since 
it  affects  sow  productivity,  milk  production,  and  piglet  per-
formance. In commercial farms, about 15% to 17% of total 
feeding costs are dedicated to the feeding of sows (Solà-Oriol 
and  Gasa,  2017). As  far  as  environmental  impacts  are  con-
cerned,  about  80%  of  P  and  70%  of  N  intake  in  lactating 

sows  may  be  excreted  in  feces  and  urine  (Jongbloed  et  al., 
1999;  Jondreville  and  Dourmad,  2005),  thus  having  strong 
implications for the use of non-renewable resources and the 
possible release of pollutants into the environment. Feeding is 
also strongly related to animal welfare, with studies demon-
strating  that  body  reserve  mobilization  during  lactation 
should be limited (Quesnel, 2005) by providing appropriate

feeding during lactation, in order to improve sow reproduc-
tive performance and longevity. Other studies have indicated 
that  enriched  fiber  diets  during  late  gestation  were  able  to 
stimulate  feed  intake  after  farrowing  and  to  improve  sow 
behavior  (Guillemet  et  al.,  2006).  For  lactating  sows,  nutri-
ent supply must thus match nutrient requirements as closely 
as  possible  in  order  to  enhance  the  overall  sustainability  of 
swine farming systems, while achieving production objectives 
and being in line with society’s animal welfare concerns.

Conventional feeding systems during lactation are based on 
a close to ad libitum delivery of a single diet. The diet com-
position is optimized to span the nutrient requirements of all 
sows over the entire lactation period, while limiting costs at 
the herd level. Nutrient requirements are generally estimated 
in  a  retrospective  manner  from  the  average  performance 
of  the  herd  (Dourmad  et  al.,  2008;  NRC,  2012).  However, 
sizeable variations in nutrient requirements were reported in 
time and among sows (Gauthier et al., 2019), indicating that 
conventional feeding strategies may lead to individual nutri-
ent  excess  or  deficiency. At  the  same  time,  new  capabilities 
are being offered to farmers to make more efficient decisions 
with the help of new sensors and technologies (Wathes et al., 
2008). It is now possible to individually identify animals and 
perform  more  measurements  on-farm  in  order  to  evaluate 
each sow’s production potential. This is currently driving the 
research toward precision feeding systems, which aim to pro-
vide the right amount of nutrients at the right time for each 
animal (Pomar and Remus, 2019).

Recently,  data-driven  and  real-time  mathematical  models 
of  daily  nutrient  use  during  lactation  have  been  developed 
based  on  nutritional  knowledge  acquired  in  past  decades 
(Gauthier  et  al.,  2019). The  effects  of  milk  production  and 
feed intake were identified as being the main drivers of nutri-
ent requirement variability during lactation and among sows. 
As  an  adequate  proxy  for  milk  production,  Gauthier  et  al. 
(2022) proposed a way to efficiently train a predictive algo-

rithm for on-farm estimation of litter weight at weaning. Sim-
ilarly,  from  the  large  amounts  of  data  that  can  be  collected 
by smart electronic feeders, Gauthier et al. (2021) developed 
a new predictive algorithm for sow daily feed intake during 
lactation.

Based  on  these  studies,  a  new  Decision  Support  System 
(DSS) that follows the principles of precision feeding is pro-
posed,  in  order  to  predict  individual  daily  nutrient  require-
ments during lactation on the basis of expected litter growth 
and  sow  appetite. The  support  system  then  delivers  a  daily 
tailored  ration  based  on  these  requirements,  by  mixing  two 
diets  with  different  concentrations  of  digestible  proteins, 
amino  acids,  and  minerals. The  objectives  of  this  study  are 
to describe the main features of this DSS, and to evaluate a 
precision  feeding  strategy  based  on  the  DSS  in  comparison 
with a conventional feeding strategy, in terms of sow and lit-
ter performance, nutrient intake and excretion, and feed cost.

Materials and Methods
The animal data used in this paper were obtained from a com-
mercial farm using commercial feeding devices. All sows and 
piglets were cared for according to the recommended code of 
practice of the National Farm Animal Care Council (2014).

General approach
The general approach of this study is illustrated in Figure 
1. Two experimental treatments were compared: a precision 
feeding strategy (PRE) and a conventional feeding strategy 
(STD).  Sows  were  allocated  to  treatments  according  to 
their  parity  and  body  weight  before  farrowing.  Each  PRE 
sow received a daily tailored ration obtained from a blend 
of  two  diets:  a  diet  with  a  high  AA  and  mineral  content 
(High: 13.00 g/kg SID Lys, and 4.50 g/kg digestible P) and 
a  diet  low  in AAs  and  minerals  (Low:  6.50  g/kg  SID  Lys, 
and 2.90 g/kg digestible P). A detailed composition of the

two diets is given in Table 1 on an as-fed basis. The propor-
tion between High and Low diets was estimated online on 
a daily timescale for each PRE sow. Based on the principles 
of precision feeding, using real time measurements on sow 
and litter and tuned for the nutritional requirements of lac-
tating sows, the DSS predicted the optimal daily ration to 
be  given  to  each  sow. This  was  done  by  1)  predicting  her 
piglet  average  daily  gain  (PADG)  according  to  her  parity 
and current litter size, with these data being used to predict 
energy and protein output in milk, 2) calculating her daily 
nutrient requirements, and 3) predicting her appetite based 
on  her  previous  daily  feed  intakes  (DFIs).  This  informa-
tion was then transferred to an individual electronic feeder 
(Gestal  Quattro,  JYGA  Technologies,  Québec,  Canada), 
which handled feed mixing and distribution. STD sows, on 
the other hand, received the same conventional diet (STD) 
during the entire lactation period. This diet was obtained by 
mixing the High and Low diets in a fixed proportion (55% 
and  45%,  respectively,  to  achieve  10.08  g/kg  SID  Lys  and 
3.78 g/kg digestible P, the content of the conventional lac-
tation diet used on the farm). Real-time data were collected 
by the farmers (sow body weight and backfat thickness, lit-
ter size, and piglet body weight) and by the smart feeders, 
and  then  stored  in  a  relational  database  management  sys-

3

tem (RDBMS) for online operations (PRE only), and evalu-
ation (PRE and STD).

At the end of the experiment, the historical data collected 
from the experiment were analyzed. Based on measurements 
at  farrowing,  weaning,  and  estrus,  sow  and  litter  response 
were first evaluated according to their feeding strategy. Daily 
observations  were  then  processed  with  a  nutritional  model 
for the ex post assessment of nutrient requirements and the 
calculation  of  P  and  N  balance  over  the  lactation  period. 
Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of the DSS, the 
predictions of the DSS’s various components were evaluated 
against the observed values (PADG, DFI). The ex ante and ex 
post calculations of nutrient requirements (SID Lys and STTD 
P) were also compared.

The following sections describe the DSS and how it was tai-
lored with farm data, animal management during the experi-
ment, and calculations and statistical methods for evaluation.

Description of the decision support system
Components.
The DSS handled individual data collection and management 
at sow and litter levels. The DSS was composed of a RDBMS 
(MySQL  8.0)  containing  the  different  data  related  to  the 
description of the experiment, the performance of sows and 
their litters, DFI recordings collected by the electronic feeders, 
and data produced by the DSS. Each sow was identified with 
a unique number. Entries related to lactating sows, litters, and 
DFI  were  accessible  through  a  web  interface  (Django  3.0), 
to enable farmers to access it in real time for data collection 
and  verification.  Entries  related  to  DFI  were  automatically 
retrieved from the electronic feeder.

The DSS included machine learning algorithms to process 
the  collected  data  and  make  predictions.  The  first  machine 
learning algorithm predicted PADG from sow parity and litter 
size, according to past farm performance. Piglet growth was 
considered  as  a  proxy  for  milk  production  to  modulate  the 
real-time estimation of daily nutrient requirements (Gauthier 
et  al.,  2022).  Because  sows  were  fed  ad  libitum  during  lac-
tation,  a  second  machine  learning  algorithm  was  trained  to 
predict DFI based on previous feeding behaviors of sows on 
the farm, in combination with the DFI values collected online 
on each sow (Gauthier et al., 2021).

The  DSS  also  relies  on  precise  knowledge  of  nutrient  use 
by  each  sow,  via  a  data-driven  and  real-time  mathematical 
model (Gauthier et al., 2019). This model, based mainly on 
the InraPorc model (Dourmad et al., 2008), uses a factorial 
approach to estimate daily maintenance costs and milk pro-
duction  costs  for  each  sow,  while  taking  into  account  the 
expected  PADG,  and  litter  size.  It  also  predicts  sow  body 
reserve mobilization, and energy and amino acids that sows 
release during postpartum uterine involution, which also sup-
ply some nutrients.

Predicted DFI and estimated nutrient requirements made it 
possible to formulate a daily ration containing the expected 
daily SID Lys supply, and this “decision” was transmitted to 
the electronic feeders for application.

Training the two predictive algorithms. 
In order to train the litter growth predictive algorithm, a data-
base was built with data from 1,691 lactations collected at the 
farm between July 2019 and March 2020, according to the 
procedure described by Gauthier et al. (2022). The database

contained data relative to sow parity, litter size at birth (LSB), 
litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at birth (LWB), lit-
ter weight at weaning (LWW), and lactation length. A linear 
regression model was trained with fixed effects of LSW and 
sow parity (P1: 1, P2: 2, P3+: 3 and beyond) on Litter Aver-
age Daily Gain (LADG), computed as the litter weight gain

To  train  the  feed  intake  predictive  algorithm,  daily  feed 
intake data were collected at the farm between January 2018 
and July 2020 on a total of 3,712 sows. The sows’ feed intake 
trajectory curves at the farm were extracted from the training 
database  using  the  k-Shape  learning  algorithm  (Paparrizos 
and Gravano, 2016), associated with k = 2, selected as being 
the  best  cluster  value  according  to  Silhouette  and  Calinski 
Harabasz scores (Gauthier et al., 2021). The mean feed intake 
in the training database was 5.78 kg. Online daily prediction 
of feed intake first required each PRE sow to be assigned to 
the closest feed intake trajectory curve, which had been pre-
viously identified by means of the shape-based distance (Pap-
arrizos and Gravano, 2016). One-day-ahead feed intake was 
then predicted from the feed intake values of the sow in the 
two previous days, according to the method used by Gauth-
ier et al. (2021). On day 1, when there was no previous feed 
intake information available, the prediction was replaced by 
2.43  kg,  the  mean  feed  intake  in  the  training  database.  On 
day 2, the online prediction was computed according to the 
closest feed intake behavior and the real feed intake on day 1.

Online process. 
The software was developed using Python 3 (Python Software 
Foundation, Beaverton, OR), and used cron (Unix) software 
for  daily  scripts  automation.  Computations  that  changed 
the  feed  composition  were  planned  to  take  place  between 
midnight  and  the  first  meal  of  each  day,  which  occurred  at 
06:00.  During  the  computation  process,  the  individual  feed 
intake from the previous day was first collected to assess the 
true nutrient intake and predict the next feed intake for the 
coming  day.  Changes  in  the  number  of  suckled  piglets,  due 
to possible piglet mortality or fostering, were used to trigger 
a new prediction of the milk nutrient output. Based on these 
predictions,  nutrient  requirements  were  then  predicted,  and 
the optimal blend between High and Low diets was computed 
in order to meet the predicted requirement in SID Lys. Finally, 
this daily ratio between the two feeds was sent to the auto-
mated feeder to be applied to each sow on that particular day.

Animal management
The trial took place between July and November 2020 in 12 
successive farrowing batches. Within each batch, sows from 
the two feeding strategies were bred over the same week and 
transferred at the same time to the same farrowing house, and 

were  fed  close  to  ad  libitum  by  allowing  them  to  eat  extra 
amount of 15% compared to daily historical data. Sows were 
assigned  to  one  of  the  feeding  strategies  according  to  their 
parity, their body weight, and backfat depth before farrowing. 
Pairs of similar sows were identified and randomly assigned 
to the PRE and the STD groups, so that average parity, body 
weight, and backfat depth before farrowing were matched as 
closely as possible in the two feeding strategies. The experi-
mental treatments were applied from the onset of lactation. 
In total, 479 sows were included in the experiment (239 and 
240 sows in the PRE and STD treatments, respectively). The 
sows were crossbred Landrace x Large-White (Line 276, Fast 
Genetics, Saskatoon, Canada).

The  PRE  sows  received  a  variable  proportion  of  High 
and  Low  diets,  as  determined  by  the  DSS,  while  STD  sows 
were given the STD diet obtained by mixing High and Low 
diets  (55%  and  45%,  respectively),  which  corresponded  to 
the standard commercial lactation diet. High, Low, and STD 
diets were iso-caloric on a net-energy basis (10.57 MJ/kg) but 
were different in terms of AA and mineral concentration. A 
detailed composition of the diets and their nutrient values is 
given in Table 1 on an as-fed basis.

Animal  response  measured  during  lactation  in  sows  and 
piglets was entered into the database through the web inter-
face. On the day of farrowing, sow parity, body weight, and 
backfat thickness were recorded, and litter size and individ-
ual piglet weight were measured. During lactation, litter size 
was recorded each day to account for possible cross-fostering 
and piglet death. Occasional sow feed refusal was weighted 
each day and removed. Daily feed intake was automatically 
recorded by the feeder. Individual piglet weight was measured 
one  day  prior  to  weaning.  Sow  body  weight  and  backfat 
thickness were measured on weaning day.

Evaluation and statistical methods
Evaluation  and  statistical  analyses  were  conducted  using 
Python 3, with statsmodels (0.12.1), and SciPy (1.3.3) pack-
ages (Figure 1). An ANOVA was first carried out to evaluate 
the  effect  of  the  feeding  strategy  on  sow  and  litter  perfor-
mance,  with  results  considered  statistically  significant  when 
P < 0.05. Tested variables were related to sow (body weight 
and  backfat  thickness  before  farrowing,  after  farrowing, 
and after weaning, and weaning-to-estrus interval) and litter 
performance (sizes and weight at birth and at weaning, and 
average  daily  gain  of  piglets  and  litter  over  lactation).  Sow 
body weight after farrowing was computed from body weight 
before farrowing and piglet weight at birth, in line with Dour-
mad et al. (1997).

Ex  post  requirements  were  evaluated  after  lactation  with 
a  nutritional  model  (Gauthier  et  al.,  2019)  from  individual 
data on sows and litters collected during the experiment. An 
ANOVA was then carried out to evaluate the effect of treat-
ments on ex post requirements and intakes. All statistical anal-
yses were calculated based on a statistical significance cut-off 
of P < 0.05. Tested variables were ex post ME, SID Lys, and 
STTD P requirements and intakes, DFI, and the percentage of 
High  feed  delivered.  Daily  nutrient  supplies  were  compared 
to ex post nutrient requirements, on daily and weekly times-
cales. A global comparison was performed between precision 
and  conventional  feeding  strategies  to  assess  differences  in 
N  and  P  balances.  Each  balance  was  calculated  considering 
the total ingestion of nutrients minus the amount of nutrients 
exported in milk. N mobilization was also taken into account,

considering  it  as  a  source  of  nutrients  as  N  ingested,  and 
assuming that 15% of body weight loss consisted of proteins. 
The  feed  cost  during  the  trial  was  also  compared  between 
feeding  strategies  based  on  the  amounts  consumed  and  the 
price of each diet.

The DSS’s predictions were compared with several metrics 
against  observations  (PADG,  DFI)  and  ex  post  calculated 
requirements (SID Lys and STTD P). The metrics used were 
the coefficient of determination (r2), the mean error, the mean 
absolute  error  (MAE)  and  the  mean  absolute  percentage 
error (MAPE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the 
root mean square percentage error (RMSEP). A comparison 
between  training  data  and  observed  performance  of  LADG 
and DFI was also carried out.

gies,  and  the  average  parity  was  also  similar  in  PRE  (3.59) 
and STD (3.64, P = 0.80) sows. Body weight did not differ 
between  treatments  before  farrowing  (PRE:  292.7  kg,  STD: 
291.2  kg,  P  =  0.66),  after  farrowing  (PRE:  261.9  kg,  STD: 
260.8 kg, P = 0.73), nor after weaning (PRE: 254.2 kg, STD: 
258.6 kg, P = 0.19). Sow body weight loss during lactation 
was  significantly  greater  in  PRE  (7.7  kg)  than  in  STD  sows 
(2.1 kg, P < 0.001). Backfat thickness did not differ between 
treatments before farrowing (PRE: 15.6 mm, STD: 15.7 mm, 
P = 0.68), nor after weaning (PRE: 12.2 mm, STD: 12.3 mm, 
P = 0.68), and backfat loss during lactation was the same in 
both groups (3.4 mm, P = 0.92).

Litter and piglet performance at birth were comparable in 
both  feeding  strategies.  Litter  size  after  cross-fostering  was 
equal to 13.7 piglets in both groups (P = 0.80). Similar aver-
age  litter  weight  at  birth  (PRE:  21.1  kg,  STD:  20.8  kg,  P  = 
0.32), similar heterogeneity, i.e., standard deviation of piglet’s 
weights  at  birth  within  a  litter  (PRE:  0.302,  STD:  0.301,  P 
= 0.90), and similar individual piglet weights (PRE: 1.55 kg, 
STD: 1.52 kg, P = 0.23) were also observed in the two feeding 
strategies.

At  weaning,  litter  size  was  similar  between  treatments 
(12.0 piglets, P = 0.66). Litter weight at weaning was also 
comparable (PRE: 75.5 kg, STD: 77.1 kg, P = 0.14) between 
feeding strategies. No differences were found between treat-
ments  for  litter  heterogeneity  of  piglet  weight  at  weaning 
(PRE:  1.15  kg,  STD:  1.17  kg,  P  =  0.50).  However,  piglet 
weight at weaning was about 3% lighter in the PRE treat-
ment  (6.29  kg)  than  in  the  STD  treatment  (6.47  kg,  P  < 
0.05).

The average litter daily weight gain was significantly differ-
ent depending on the feeding strategy. It was lower by about 
3% in the PRE treatment (2.96 kg/d) than in the STD treat-
ment (3.06 kg/d, P < 0.05). The average piglet daily weight 
gain was also significantly smaller in PRE sows than in STD 
sows, with 247 and 257 g/d, respectively (P < 0.05).

Weaning  to  estrus  interval  was  computed  on  184  PRE 
(5.8 ± 5.5 d on average) and 177 STD (5.3 ± 4.9 d on aver-
age) sows, and did not differ between treatments (P = 0.39).

Ex post nutrient requirements and intake
Average requirements across lactation. 
The average ex post nutrient requirements and intake during 
lactation are presented in Table 3. Feed intake did not differ 
between feeding strategies (PRE: 6.59 kg/d, STD: 6.45 kg/d, 
P  =  0.11).  The  ex  post  ME  requirement  was  significantly 
lower  in  PRE  sows  (110.1  MJ/d)  than  in  STD  sows  (113.1 
MJ/d, P < 0.05), whereas ME intake did not differ between 
feeding  strategies  (PRE:  87.5  MJ/d,  STD:  86.2  MJ/d,  P  = 
0.26). Metabolizable energy intake represented a significantly 
greater proportion of the ME requirements in PRE (79.6 %) 
than in STD (76.3 %) sows (P < 0.05).

The  ex  post  SID  Lys  requirement  was  significantly  lower 
in PRE sows (8.1 g/kg) compared to STD sows (8.5 g/kg, P 
< 0.05). The SID Lys intake was lower and more variable in 
PRE (7.7 g/kg ± 0.98) than in STD sows (10.0 g/kg ± 0.12, P 
< 0.001). The dietary SID Lys content of the STD diet met the 
requirement of 84.7% of the STD sows. The ex post STTD P 
requirement was slightly lower (P < 0.05) in PRE sows (3.0 g/
kg)  compared  to  STD  sows  (3.1  g/kg). The  STTD  P  intake 
was lower (P < 0.001) and more variable in PRE sows, and 
was lower (3.2 g/kg ± 0.24) compared to STD sows (3.8 g/

kg ± 0.03). The dietary STTD P content of the STD diet met 
the requirement of 88.4% of the STD sows. The proportion 
of High feed in the ration was significantly different between 
PRE (19%) and STD (54%, P < 0.001) sows.

Nutrient supply dynamic over lactation.
Different amounts of High feed were delivered depending on 
the  feeding  strategy,  with  variations  across  time  (Figure  2). 
STD sows received 54.0% (± 4.3) of High feed in their diet, 
while PRE sows received on average 19.0% (± 21.1) of High 
feed in their diet. In detail, this proportion was 20.5% (± 21.4) 
during first week of lactation, 21.2% (± 21.7) during second 
week, and 14.0% (± 18.9) during third week of lactation. The 
mean proportions of High feed were highest on day 1 (26.1% 
± 7.3) and 7 (24.7% ± 22.1). This proportion subsequently 
showed a slow decrease, down to 12.0% (± 19.7) on day 19.
Differences  between  SID  Lys  supplies  and  ex  post  requirements 
were compared on a daily timescale (Figure 3), and a weekly timescale

(Figure 4). On average, STD sows received more SID Lys than their 
requirement. Over the first 5 d, the daily excess decreased from 11.2 (± 
12.5) g/d down to 3.0 (± 10.3) g/d. Then it increased almost linearly by 
1.3 g/d (P < 0.001) up to day 20 (23.6 ± 17.7 g/d). On average, PRE 
sows received slightly less SID Lys than their requirement, except on 
day 1. From day 2 to day 5, the daily deficiency in SID Lys increased 
from 2.3 (± 7.7) up to 5.3 (± 7.9) g/d. Then it decreased slowly and 
almost linearly by 0.2 g/d (P < 0.001) down to 3.2 g (± 18.3) on day 
20. On a weekly timescale (Figure 4), the proportions of sows receiving 
adequate (± 5% of the requirement), deficient (5% to 15% or >15%), 
or excess amounts (5% to 15% or <15%) of SID Lys according to 
average ex post requirements differed according to an χ2 test between 
PRE and STD feeding strategies in week 1 (P < 0.001), 2 (P < 0.001), 
and 3+ (P < 0.001). The proportions of STD sows with a SID Lys 
supply exceeding their requirement by more than 15% were 55.4%, 
55.4%, and 75.4%, in weeks 1, 2, and 3+, respectively. The propor-
tions of STD sows receiving adequate amounts of SID Lys (i.e., ± 5% 
of the requirement) were 13.3%, 13.8%, and 11.3%, in weeks 1, 2, 
and 3+, respectively. More PRE than STD sows exhibited a SID lysine 
deficit, with 33.1%, 30.1% and 28.5% of the sows receiving less than 
85% of their requirement in weeks 1, 2, and 3+, respectively. The pro-
portion of PRE sows receiving adequate amounts of SID Lys (i.e., ± 5% 
of the requirement) was 20.1%, 22.6%, and 24.7%, in weeks 1, 2, and 
3+, respectively.

Differences between STTD P supplies and ex post require-
ments  were  also  compared  on  a  daily  timescale  (Figure  3). 
STD  sows  received  higher  supplies  of  STTD  P  than  their 
requirements. During the first 5 d, the daily excess decreased 
from 2.7 (± 4.8) g/d down to 1.0 (± 3.8) g/d. Then, it increased 
almost linearly by 0.6 g/d (P < 0.001) up to 10.5 (± 6.6) g/d 
on day 20. PRE sows also received higher supplies of STTD P 
than their requirement, except on day 2. This excess increased 
slowly and almost linearly by 0.3 g/d (P < 0.001) from day 6 
(0.4 ± 3.4) to day 20 (3.3 ± 7.8).

Nitrogen and phosphorus balance
The N and P balance over lactation is presented in Table 4. 
Nitrogen  intake  was  lower,  by  about  20.1%,  in  PRE  sows 
compared to STD sows, the difference being almost the same 
for  SID  Lys  intake  (−23.2%).  Nitrogen  in  milk  was  slightly 
lower, by about 3%, in PRE than STD sows, whereas N mobi-
lized  from  body  reserves  was  higher  (9.0  vs.  2.5  g/d).  This 
resulted  in  a  28.0%  reduction  in  N  excretion  in  PRE  com-
pared to STD sows.

observed values (PADG, DFI), and by comparing the ex ante 
against  ex  post  calculations  of  nutrient  requirements  (SID 
Lys and STTD P; Table 5). Predictions of DFI were strongly 
correlated  with  observations  (r²  =  0.76). The  observed  DFI 
was, however, slightly higher than expected, with a difference 
of 0.11 kg/d (+1.7%). DFI showed an almost linear increase 
over  the  lactation  period  (Figure  5).  At  day  1,  the  mean

P  intake  was  lower,  by  about  19.3%,  in  PRE  sows  com-
pared to STD sows, the difference being almost the same for 
STTD  P  intake  (−14.3%).  P  in  milk  was  slightly  lower,  by 
about  3%,  in  PRE  than  STD  sows. This  resulted  in  42.2% 
reduction in P excretion in PRE compared to STD sows.

Feed cost formulated on the basis of feed ingredient prices in July 
2020 was cheaper by 11.7% in the PRE (CA$265.04/t) than in the 
STD  feeding  strategy  (CA$300.22/t).  However,  because  of  slightly 
higher feed consumption in PRE sows, the extent of the difference was 
slightly lower when expressed per sow per lactation (−10%, CA$35.28 
vs CA$39.31 per sow for PRE and STD treatments, respectively).

Evaluation of DSS components
The performance of the different components of the DSS were 
evaluated in PRE sows by comparing DSS predictions against

prediction  of  DFI  was  lower  than  the  mean  observed  DFI, 
with  2.43  (±  0.00)  and  3.56  (±  1.15)  kg,  respectively.  The 
MAE of DFI prediction is 0.77 kg/d, which represents 11.6% 
of the observed DFI of sows. For piglet growth, predictions 
of  PADG  were  weakly  correlated  with  observations  (r²  = 
0.12). Observed PADG was greater than predicted values by 
10  g/d  (i.e.,  by  4.2%).  The  corresponding  MAE  of  predic-
tion is 31 g/d, which represents 12.4% of the observed mean 
PADG. The predicted daily SID Lys requirement was strongly 
correlated with the ex post requirement (r² = 0.77), but it was 
on average 4.5 g/d lower (i.e., 8.6% lower) than the ex post 
requirement,  with  a  relative  MAE  of  12.8%. The  predicted 
SID Lys requirement per kg feed was significantly correlated 
with observations (r² = 0.24), with a difference of −0.5 g/kg 
(i.e., 6.3% lower) and a MAE of 1.3 g/kg (i.e., 15.9%).

Discussion
General structure of the DSS
The DSS presented here mainly relies on a nutritional model 
and  on  machine  learning  algorithms  to  process  the  flow  of 
data produced on-farm during lactation. This makes it possi-
ble to take multiple sources of variability in nutrient require-
ments into account, and to provide nutrient recommendations 
at  the  individual  level  in  real  time.  This  system  thus  intro-
duces an important paradigm shift compared to conventional 
nutrient recommendations, which are generally determined at 
the  herd  level  and,  in  most  cases,  on  average  for  the  entire 
lactation  period. To  our  knowledge,  this  DSS  is  the  first  of 
its kind for the precision feeding of lactating sows; however, 
similar approaches have already been explored for fattening 
pigs (Hauschild et al., 2012) and gestating sows (Dourmad et 
al., 2017).

Evaluation of feeding strategies
On average, sow feed intake amounted to 6.5 kg/d. Compa-
rable performance was reported in the literature, for example 
6.5  and  5.8  kg/d  in  Gauthier  et  al.  (2019),  and  6.3  kg/d  in 
Hojgaard et al. (2019). Pedersen et al. (2016) found a higher 
feed  intake  of  6.9  kg/d,  but  this  was  for  a  longer  lactation 
period, which could explain this difference.

Loss  of  back  fat,  generally  associated  with  energy  defi-
ciency  (Noblet,  1990),  was  relatively  low  (3.4  mm),  show-
ing  no  difference  between  feeding  strategies.  This  is  in  line 
with  the  similar  energy  intake  observed  for  both  strategies. 

This value is also comparable to findings from Strathe et al. 
(2017), who reported a loss of 2.9 mm. Body weight loss was 
higher  in  the  precision  feeding  strategy  (7.7  kg)  than  in  the 
standard strategy (2.1 kg). Body weight loss during lactation 
is frequently associated with a higher risk of reproductive fail-
ure after weaning (Quesnel, 2005). However, the higher body 
weight loss in the precision feeding strategy did not increase 
the weaning-to-estrus interval of sows, probably because this 
loss  remained  rather  small.  Indeed,  from  a  previous  review, 
Pedersen et al. (2016) reported that highly prolific sows fed ad 
libitum may lose between 10 and 30 kg of body weight during 
lactation, and Gourley et al. (2020) recorded a body weight 
loss of 8.5 kg. The significant difference in body weight loss 
observed in the present study might be related to lower AA 
supply to sows in the precision feeding strategy (Strathe et al., 
2020), due to the DSS’s weak performance in predicting the 
variability of litter growth and milk production.

Litter average daily gain (LADG) was high with an average of 
3.0 kg/d. According to recent studies, LADG was found to fall 
between 2.6 kg/d and 3.0 kg/d (Gauthier et al., 2019; Gourley 
et al., 2020). However, a significant and slight reduction of 3% 
in LADG was observed in sows fed under the precision feeding 
strategy compared to the control. Because of a similar feed intake 
in both feeding strategies, this difference is likely due to insuffi-
cient AA supply. Sows fed under the precision feeding strategy, 
for which milk production was underestimated, may have mobi-
lized a greater amount of body proteins to fulfill the high require-
ments of demanding litters (Trottier et al., 2015). This was not 
the case for STD sows, which received AAs in excess compared 
to their requirements. This agrees with the greater body weight 
losses observed in the precision feeding strategy.

The  analysis  of  ex  post  requirements  also  indicates  1)  that 
SID  Lys  requirements  may  have  been  higher  than  predicted, 
and  2)  that  the  daily  balance  in  SID  Lys  between  intake  and 
requirement was generally slightly negative. This is even more 
important if we consider that the potential SID Lys requirement 
is the one observed with the standard feeding strategy, in which 
nutrient supply is likely to exceed sows’ nutrient requirements. 
Given  the  components  of  the  DSS,  both  an  overestimation  of 
feed intake and an underestimation of litter growth could result 
in  an  underestimation  of  the  AA  requirements.  Because  feed 
intake tended to be slightly underestimated, the underestimation 
of  litter  growth  is  likely  to  be  the  main  reason. This  is  partly 
related  to  the  fact  that  the  litter  performance  in  the  database 
used to train the predictive algorithm is slightly lower than the 
performance achieved during the experiment. As discussed in the 

Figure 5. Influence of the stage of lactation on observed feed intake (precision and standard feeding strategies), and predicted feed intake (precision 
feeding strategy).

following subsection, careful attention must be paid to training 
the algorithm to predict litter growth, which is highly sensitive 
to the training database.

From a dynamic point of view, the DSS made it possible to 
better take the variability in nutrient requirements into account 
over the lactation period. Except for the first day when there 
was  no  prediction  available,  the  percentage  of  High  feed 
strongly increased during the first week of lactation and subse-
quently decreased slightly. This is related to an increase in nutri-
ent requirements due to milk production that is faster than the 
increase in the sows’ feed intake capacity (Hansen et al., 2012). 
After  the  peak  in  nutrient  exportation  in  milk,  the  reduction 
of the proportion of High feed in the diet for PRE sows results 
from the increase in feed intake, while milk production tended 
to plateau or even decrease. Sows within the STD feeding strat-
egy received the same feed throughout their lactation, thus their 
daily balance in SID Lys was only influenced by the evolution 
of their nutrient requirements. On the other hand, for sows in 
the  precision  feeding  strategy,  nutrient  requirements  and  diet 
composition  evolved  simultaneously,  leading  to  a  more  con-
stant and almost nil balance between requirement and supply. 
As for STTD P, this balance was positive and showed a similar 
trend in both feeding strategies. This might be due to the diet 
tailoring  process,  which  was  done  only  according  to  SID  Lys 
requirements.

In the STD feeding strategy, nutrient supplies made it pos-
sible to meet the requirements of most sows at the herd level 
(SID Lys: 84.7% of the sows, STTD P: 88.4% of the sows), 

but led to a higher excretion of N and P in feces and urine. 
The precision feeding strategy made it possible to reduce N 
and P excretion by 28.0% and 27.2%, respectively. These val-
ues may be compared to the 38% reduction in N and P excre-
tion found in growing pigs (Pomar et al., 2011). For a similar 
approach  in  gestating  sows,  Gaillard  et  al.  (2020)  found  a 
reduction in N and P excretion of 16.7% and 15.4%, respec-
tively. The present study also reports an 11.7% reduction in 
feeding  cost,  which  could  confirm  the  economic  benefits  of 
precision feeding strategies reported for growing pigs (10.5%, 
Pomar et al., 2011) and gestating sows (3.6%, Gaillard et al., 
2020). Precision feeding thus seems to be a promising strategy 
for reducing feeding cost and nutrient excretion in lactating 
sows. However, it is expected that these reductions depend on 
the standard diet used in conventional feeding strategy. The 
richer and the more expensive the standard diet is, the bigger 
the reduction in nutrient excretion and feeding cost.

Recommendations for future usage of the DSS in 
practice
The analysis of the respective performance of each component of 
the DSS revealed important points for future implementation of 
precision feeding systems in lactating sows. We propose a rank-
ing of these observations by order of importance and some rec-
ommendations to enhance the performance of the DSS.

a)  The LADG predictive algorithm suffered from concept drift, 
which is a situation where the underlying structure of data

learned during the training process becomes inapplicable at 
the time the prediction is made (Žliobaite et al., 2016). This 
process may have been incremental in our case with most 
changes occurring between early and late September 2020 
(Figure 6). Interestingly, the predictive error after this period 
remained lower on average in the precision feeding strategy, 
which may be due to greater body protein mobilization, as 
mentioned earlier. This component could be improved by 
adding environmental attributes (such as outdoor and in-
door temperatures) to the training process of the algorithm. 
It could also be improved by using online adaptive learning 
techniques  that  would  refit  part  of  the  model,  for  exam-
ple, with new data acquired after weaning a batch of sows 
(Gama et al., 2014).

b)  The  predictive  feed  intake  algorithm  is  another  aspect 
that  could  contribute  to  a  better  match  between  nutri-
ent supply and requirements. Compared to the predictive 
LADG algorithm, this second algorithm did not seem to 
be affected by concept drift. This prediction was in fact 
established from herd historical data and sow live data 
(Gauthier  et  al.,  2021),  which  increased  its  robustness. 
First, it would be of interest to explore the structure of 
daily variations in feed intake behaviors that can be ex-
tracted by a time series clustering algorithm. If this struc-
ture is meaningful, a seasonal component might be added 
to the prediction (Cleveland et al., 1990).

c)  For the nutritional model, some data may not be avail-
able in every commercial farm, such as body weight and 
backfat thickness. A solution would be to use mean sow 
weight  and  backfat  thickness,  according  to  their  parity 
or  age.  However,  we  strongly  recommend  the  use  of  a 
reliable  weighing  device  to  improve  the  estimation  of 
maintenance costs for sows.

Direct  evaluation  of  the  nutritional  mathematical  model  is 
no  easy  task  since  it  is  related  to  the  prediction  of  several 
biological mechanisms. Safety margins at the individual level 
could thus be considered to offset the imprecision in some of 
parameters of the nutritional model. The level of this margin 
would  result  from  a  compromise  between  risks  (increasing 
excretion and feed costs) and benefits (securing nutrient sup-
ply,  improving  performance  and  welfare).  This  is  especially 
the case for predicting PADG, for which a large part of the 
variability (about 50%) cannot be predicted by the algorithm 
(Gauthier et al., 2022).

Finally, the human–machine interface could be enhanced to 
provide useful information to farmers. Some data might also be 
of interest for different precision farming applications. It would 
thus be useful to connect the DSS with a Management Infor-
mation System for each farrowing house. This would simplify 
the tedious task of data entry for farmers.

Conclusion
Feeding  sows  with  a  tailored  diet  is  a  promising  strategy 
for  matching  nutrient  supply  to  nutrient  requirements  at 
the individual level in real time. The proposed DSS makes it 
possible to reduce N and P excretion and feeding cost, while 
better  satisfying  individual  requirements.  Litter  growth  per-
formance is high, although it is slightly lower, by about 3%, 
compared to the conventional strategy. Sow body weight loss 
increased slightly with precision feeding, but it remained low 

and  the  sows’  reproductive  performance  after  weaning  was 
not affected. These effects appear to be mainly related to an 
underestimation  of  litter  growth  in  some  sows,  leading  to 
insufficient AA supply. This prediction needs to be revised in 
the future to address concept drift challenges.
