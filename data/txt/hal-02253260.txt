Abstract  

This  paper  presents  HydroShoot,  a  leaf-based  functional-structural  plant  model  (FSPM)  that 

simulates gas-exchange rates of complex plant canopies under water deficit conditions. HydroShoot is 

built  assuming  that  simulating  both  the  hydraulic  structure  of  the  shoot  together  with  the  energy 

budget of individual leaves is the asset for successfully scaling-up leaf to canopy gas-exchange rates. 

HydroShoot  includes  three  interacting  modules: hydraulic  which  calculates  the  distribution  of  xylem 

water potential across shoot hydraulic segments, energy which calculates the complete energy budget 

individual leaves. HydroShoot was evaluated on virtual and real grapevines having strongly contrasted 

canopies, under well-watered and water deficit conditions. It captured accurately the impact of canopy 

architecture  and  soil  water  status  on  plant-scale  gas-exchange  rates  and  leaf-scale  temperature  and 

water potential. Both shoot hydraulic structure and leaf energy budget simulations were, as postulated, 

required to adequately scaling-up leaf to canopy gas-exchange rates. Notwithstanding, simulating shoot 

hydraulic  structure  was  found  more  necessary  to  adequately  performing  this  scaling  task  than 

simulating leaf energy budget. That is, the intra-canopy variability of leaf water potential was a better 

predictor of the reduction of whole plant gas-exchange rates under water deficit than the intra-canopy 

variability  of  leaf  temperature.  We  conclude  that  simulating  the  shoot  hydraulic  structure  is  a 

prerequisite  if  FSPM’s  are  to  be  used  to  assess  gas-exchange  rates  of  complex  plant  canopies  as

Introduction 

Climate  change  is  seriously  challenging  viticulture  sustainability  in  its  current  areas  of 

production (Hannah et al., 2013; van Leeuwen et al., 2013; Duchêne et al., 2014). One efficient short-

That is what functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) offer (Vos et al., 2010). 

FSPMs  received  nevertheless  little  attention  in  grapevine  scientific  literature  to  assess  the 

term solution for hampering the projected adverse effects of water and heat stress on viticulture, is to 
reconsider training systems so that they allow maximizing the ratio of carbon assimilation (        ) to 
water loss by transpiration (      ) whilst maintaining optimal leaf temperature conditions (Medrano et 
al., 2012; Duchêne et al., 2014; Palliotti et al., 2014). However, training systems present a wealth of 

possibilities (Reynolds and Vanden Heuvel, 2009) that cannot be compared experimentally. Therefore, 

the  design  of  canopy  structures  that  are  adapted  to  adverse  environmental  conditions  is  most 

efficiently  performed  with  the  aid  of  models  able  to  accurately  predict  the  influence  of  canopy 

architecture on its gas exchange rates and leaves temperature under combined water and heat stress. 

impact of shoot architecture on plant gas-exchange rates (Medrano et al., 2015 a). This is probably 

due to the inherent complexity in scaling up eco-physiological processes from the leaf to the canopy 

level, as strong variability in gas exchange rates (CO2 versus water vapor) exists inside the canopy 

driven by variations in micrometeorological conditions and leaf functional traits (Niinemets et al., 2014; 

Medrano et al., 2015 b). This scaling-up task is even more complex under water deficit conditions, as 

stomatal  aperture  is likely  to  reduce  under  water  deficit in  a  non-uniform  pattern  across  the  canopy 

(e.g. Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2012; Ngao et al., 2017) further distorting intra-canopy gas-exchange and 

leaf temperature variability (Reynolds and Vanden Heuvel, 2009). Bauerle et al. (2007) indicated that

temperature  stands  out  as  the  key  challenge  to  using  FSPMs  to  predict  plant  gas-exchange  rates 

under  water  deficit  conditions.  Yet,  the  remaining  question  is  how  this  variability  can  be  accurately 

disregarding  this  variability  may  lead  to  strongly  overestimate  the  predicted  whole  canopy  daily 

transpiration flux, up to 25% greater than observed values as they found on a study on Red Maple 

Hence, adequately predicting the intra-canopy variability of both leaf stomatal conductance and 

described and what are their main determinants. 

Describing  the  intra-canopy  variability  of  both  leaf  stomatal  conductance  and  temperature 

(Acer rubrum L.) 

requires from the one hand to explicitly describe their drivers as a function of leaf position inside the 

canopy,  and  from  the  other  hand  to  adequately  account  for  their  mutual  interactions  (how  stomatal 

aperture  affects  leaf  energy  budget  and vice versa)  (Chelle,  2005).  The  main  drivers  for  both 

processes are commonly determined as incident shortwave irradiance, air temperature, air humidity and 

leaf “water status” which determines stomatal closure (Damour et al., 2010). Among these drivers, leaf 

water  status  (which  controls  stomatal  aperture  and  consequently  both  leaf  transpiration  and 

temperature) still makes no consensus in the scientific literature when it comes to determining what it 

refers  to.  A  basal  approach  considers  that  leaf  water  status  is  equal  to  the  soil  water  status  (e.g. 

Misson et al., 2004; van Wijk et al., 2000), considering that the “remote” action of available water in

used under water deficit conditions. 

The few existing grapevine FSPM's in literature do not account for the interactions between 

water  status  of  individual  leaves  affects  the  predicted  gas-exchange  rates  and  leaf  temperature 

distribution in FSPMs under water deficit and this matter needs to be assessed if FSPMs are to be 

the rhizosphere impacts uniformly all leaves regardless of their position. By contrast, leaf water status 

may also be considered as a “local” water status specific to each individual leaf (e.g.  Tuzet et al., 

2003; Buckley et al., 2003) which results from the interplay between water demand (transpiration) and 

offer (xylem flow) at the leaf-scale, which are notably determined by the shoot hydraulic structure. This 

“local”  approach  mostly  agrees  with  observations  whereby  stomatal  closure  is  uneven  across  the 

canopy.  Sunlit  leaves,  for  instance,  experience  stronger  water  deficit  than  shaded  leaves,  and  are 

therefore the first to undergo reductions in gas exchange rates under water deficit  (Escalona et al., 

2003).  This  “local”  approach  seems  hence  as  the  most  adequate  in  FSPM’s,  however,  the  “remote” 

modelling approaches also proved satisfactory when individually considered.  (e.g. Dauzat et al., 2001; 

Bailey et al.,  2016;  Ngao et al.,  2017).  It  is  hence  unclear  in  literature  how  the  simulation  of  leaf 

water status, energy budget and gas-exchange rates at the leaf scale [see Supporting Information S1]. 

Prieto et al.  (2012)  were  probably  the  first  to  use  an  FSPM  to  examine  the  effects  of  canopy 

architecture  on  gas-exchange  in  grapevine  (cv.  Syrah).  The  authors  coupled  the  grapevine-specific 

structural  plant  model  proposed  by  Louarn et al.  (2008)  to  leaf-level  models  of  photosynthesis 

A ccepted M anuscript

(Farquhar et al., 1980) and stomatal conductance (Leuning, 1995) but did not incorporate the effects 

of (soil) water deficit. More recently, Zhu et al. (2017) developed a model similar to that proposed by 

Prieto et al.  (2012)  including  the  effect  of  water  deficit  on  gas-exchange  and  leaf  temperature. 

Nevertheless, this model assumed a uniform xylem water potential across the shoot, that disregarded 

how shoot hydraulic structure affects leaf-scale gas-exchange rates, which is an unrealistic assumption 

for large plants when considering the substantial hydraulic resistances observed in the stems of mature 

grapevine (Jacobsen et al., 2012). In addition, longwave energy exchange among leaves from the one 

hand, and between leaves and the surrounding elements from the other hand, were disregarded, which 

makes the application of this model to open field conditions not suitable since sky and soil longwave 

energies  substantially  affect  leaves  temperature  (Nobel,  2005).  This  has  been  solved  in  two  models 

that  link  a  complete  energy  budget  with  gas-exchange  in  perennials  (Bailey et al.,  2016 for Vitis 

vinifera  L.  and Acer x fremanii;  Ngao et al.,  2017  for Malus pumila  Mill.)  Yet  again,  both  models 

were  built  at  the  leaf-cluster  scale  which  does  not  allow  accounting  for  the  location  of  individual 

leaves  in  plant  hydraulic  structure  necessary  to  calculate  local  leaf  water  status.  In  addition,  both 

models  consider  the  “remote”  action  of  the  rhizosphere  on  stomatal  aperture  instead  of  the  “local’ 

water  status,  assuming  again  as  negligible  the  potential  contribution  of  shoot  hydraulic  structure  on 

shaping the intra-canopy variability of leaf stomatal conductance and temperature.

In this paper, it is postulated that intra-canopy variability in both leaf water potential and leaf 

temperature  are  the  main  drivers  for  adequately  predicting  photosynthesis  and  transpiration  fluxes  at 

the  plant  scale  under  water  deficit  conditions  using  FSPMs.  This  paper  has  threefold  objective.  The 

first is to describe HydroShoot, a leaf-scale-based FSPM that allows predicting whole plant transpiration

and photosynthesis rates by scaling-up these processes from the leaf-level. This model uses as lever 

for this scaling process the simulation of the interactions between hydraulic structure of the shoot, the 

energy balance, and gas-exchange rates of individual leaves. The second objective is to evaluate the 

performance of the model using both virtual and real canopies with data collected on photosynthesis 

and  transpiration  rates  (plant  scale),  and  stomatal  conductance  and  temperature  (leaf  scale).  Finally, 

the  third  objective  is  to  examine  how  detailed  hydraulic  structure  and  energy  budget  simulations 

determine the predicted gas-exchange rates at the plant scale under water deficit conditions. 

Materials and methods 

Model structure and basic assumptions 

HydroShoot  is  a  static  FSPM  (with  regards  to  plant  structure)  that  takes  plant  shoot 

architecture,  weather,  and  soil  water  conditions  as  inputs,  and  returns  transpiration  and  net 

photosynthesis rates both of individual leaves and the whole plant at hourly time steps as outputs. It 

is  conceived  as  a  set  of  three  modules  which  simulate  water  potential  (hydraulic  module),  energy 

budget (energy module), and C3-type gas-exchange rates (exchange module). These three modules run 

jointly, having leaf xylem water potential and temperature at the leaf level as pivots (cf. implementation 

and numerical solution section). The formalisms used in each module are developed in the following

a function of water flow in the plant and water potential of the soil (input to the module). The whole 

plant is compartmentalized in elementary conducting elements corresponding to petioles, internodes of 

the  current-year  stems,  and  elements  of  previous-year  trunk  and  branches  (internodes  or  pruning 

complexes). Leaves are treated in this system as nodes letting water flow but having no gradient in 
their water potential (     ). 

The hydraulic module computes water potentials of plant segments (output of the module) as

Water  transfer  across  the  hydraulic  segments  is  simulated  by  analogy  to  Ohm’s  law  in 
electrical  circuits  (Figure  1).  Each  segment  is  characterized  by  its  length  (    )  and  hydraulic 
conductivity  (                
)  which,  together  with 
conductivity  modifies  water  head at  its  upper (downstream,    )  and  lower  (upstream,    )  extremities

to  respond  to  environmental  stimuli  (temperature  and  irradiance)  via  photosynthesis  [see  Supporting 
Information S2]. It is based on Fick’s first law of diffusion, whereby   , the stomatal conductance to 
CO2 (      ), and the mesophyll conductance (  ) are used. However, as Farquhar’s model has been 

thoroughly  detailed  in  literature,  its  description  is  given  in  Appendix  I.  The  focus  of  this  section  is 

given instead to the stomatal conductance formulae which are a key element in this work.

Eq.  5a  does  not  account  for  stomatal  sensitivity  to  soil  water  deficit  (“remote”  approach)  or 

local leaf water potential (“local” approach). Tuzet et al. (2003) and Leuning et al. (2004) suggested to 
express      as  a  function  of  the  local       .  This  function  is  implemented  in  HydroShoot  following

Intra-canopy variability in photosynthetic capacity 

Leaf photosynthetic traits (maximum carboxylation rate       , maximum electron transport 

rate     , triose-phosphate transport rate     and   ; cf. Appendix I) have been shown to strongly 

vary within the plant canopy so that to increase light-saturated net assimilation rate with increasing

solar irradiance availability throughout the canopy (Niinemets et al., 2014). HydroShoot accounts for 
this variability by considering leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf surface area (

Finally,  this  module  was  provided  with  a  photoinhibition  model  as  this  phenomenon  is 

frequently reported to affect grapevines under combined heat and water stresses (Correia et al., 1990; 

Flexas  and  Medrano,  2002;  Lovisolo et al.,  2010).  The  simple  photoinhibition  model  implemented  in 

HydroShoot  is  detailed  in  Appendix  II  and  assumes  that  combined  heat  and  water  stresses  inhibit 
photosynthesis by reducing the electron transport rate (cf.   in Eq. A6) as the result of an increase 
of deactivation energy     (cf. equations A9 and A10). 

Energy module 

balance equation writes:  

for the sake of simplicity. 

The energy  module  computes  the  temperature  of  individual  leaves  based  on  a  detailed 

energy balance model [see Supporting Information S3]. This module will be briefly described hereafter 

Each  leaf  is  represented  as  a  group  of  solid  flat  triangles.  It  gains  energy  from  the 

absorbed shortwave (solar irradiance) and thermal longwave irradiance from the sky, the soil, and the 
neighbouring  leaves  (indexed   ).  It  loses  energy  through  its  own  emission  in  the  thermal  longwave 

band and through latent heat due to transpiration (output of exchange module). Finally, it exchanges 

energy  with  the  surrounding  air  by  thermal  conduction-convection.  The  resulting  leaf-scale  energy

It is noteworthy that only the forced convective heat transfer is currently considered in 

HydroShoot since forced convection dominates free convection once wind speed exceeds roughly 0.1 

 (Nobel 2005). This wind speed threshold is generally exceeded during diurnal hours. However, 

under low wind conditions heat transfer may be underestimated. 

Since the resolution of the last equation is highly time-consuming, we assumed the energy 

gain from the neighbouring leaves through thermal longwave as a lumped term whereby average leaf 
temperature         is considered instead of individual leaves (Dauzat et al., 2001). In this case, the 
lumped  form  factor  ∑

Finally,  the  required  complexity  level  was  evaluated,  whereby  we  sought  at  determining  whether

Midday  depression  in            was  simulated  for  the  three  canopies  proportionally  to  the 

absorbed irradiance, that is, highest for GDC and lowest for VSP (Figure 6b). The higher transpiration 

rates  of  GDC  led  to  simulate  lower  leaf  water  potential  values  (Figure  7)  around  midday,  which, 

combined  with  higher  absorbed  irradiance,  led  also  to  higher  leaf  temperatures  (Figure  8).  The 

combined effects of lower leaf water potential and higher temperature in GDC led to simulate a higher 
effect of midday depression in          compared to Lyre and VSP canopies as may be expected. 

The  simulations  at  the  plant  scale  (Figure  6)  show  that  GDC  canopies  had  the  highest 

absorbed  irradiance  rates,  followed  by  Lyre  and  VSP  canopies  (Figure  6a),  reflecting  the  higher 

exposure to solar irradiance using the GDC system. This trend was reflected on carbon assimilation 

(Figure  6b),  temperature  (Figure  6c),  and  transpiration  (Figure  6d),  whereby  highest  values  were 

obtained for GDC then Lyre followed by VSP canopies.

The  overall  adequation  between  simulated  and  observed  leaf  temperature  was  high  when 
comparing median values (Figure 11) having an     of -0.5 and -0.8    and an      of 0.8 and 
1.0    under well-watered and water deficit conditions, respectively. A greater       of 2.4    was 
obtained when leaf-to-leaf comparison was performed (Figure 12), yet,     remained at -0.45   . 

It  is  noteworthy  that  leaf  temperature  was  systematically  underestimated  during  nocturnal 

hours (Figure 11, Figure 12). Luquet et al. (2003) and Bailey et al. (2016) reported similar trends that 

they  explained  by  the  frequent  dysfunction  of  thermocouples  during  the  night.  From  a  modelling 

perspective  however,  such  discrepancies  between  simulated  and  observed  temperatures  may  be 

explained  by  three  possibilities.  From  the  one  hand,  HydroShoot  assumes  flat  leaves  having  uniform 

temperature  across  their  surface,  whereas  strong  temperature  gradients  occur  across  the  surface  of 

each  individual  leaf  due  to  their  three-dimensional  structure  (Saudreau et al.,  2017).  Thermocouples 

measure the temperature of only a limited fraction of leaf surface, and it is likely that the measured

forced heat convection driven by wind speed (cf. Eq. 14), which may lead to underestimate convective

is an underestimate leaf temperature during nocturnal hours. Finally, the error in simulated temperature

To which extent is modelling complexity needed? 

We  show  in  Figure  15  together  with  Table  1  that  the  best  fit  between  simulated  and 

observed  gas-exchange  rates  was  obtained  using  the  complete  HydroShoot  model  (i.e.  sim0)  which 
yielded,  in  almost  all  cases,  the  least  values  of       and        for  both            and        . 

However,  the  simulated  hydraulic  structure  and  spatialized  leaf  temperature  values  had  unequal 

contributions to prediction’s accuracy.

to  model  performance.  That  is,  predicting  the  intra-canopy  variability  in  leaf  water  potential  improves

Our  results  disagree  with  those  reported  by  Bauerle et al.  (2007)  who  estimated  that

traits. In their study, Bauerle et al. (2007) used leaf temperature as the primer driver for intra-canopy 

variability in leaf photosynthetic traits. In our study, we linked leaf photosynthetic traits to the 10-days

Removing the hydraulic structure (i.e. stomata are only function of VDP, sim4) increased considerably 

the time required for convergence (60% for VSP and up to 250% for the water-deficit GDC Canopy

Conclusions 

We  presented  in  this  paper  the  functional-structural  plant  model  (FSPM)  HydroShoot.  This 

model was built in order to allow simulating the effect of plant shoot architecture on its gas-exchange 

dynamics  under  soil  water  deficit  conditions.  In  order  to  achieve  this  objective,  we  constructed 

HydroShoot  on  the  base  of  three  interacting  processes:  leaf-scale  gas-exchange,  leaf-scale  energy 

balance, and internode-scale xylem transport (i.e. the hydraulic structure of the shoot). The produced 

model was evaluated using both virtual and real grapevine canopies of three strongly contrasting shoot 

architectures,  under  both  well-watered  and  water  deficit  conditions.  We  showed  that  HydroShoot 

reproduced  efficiently  the  effect  of  canopy  architecture  on  plant-scale  gas-exchange  processes  under 

the observed gradient of water deficit conditions, fulfilling thus the objectives for which the model was

built.  We  showed  furthermore  that  both  hydraulic  structure  and  energy  balance  simulations  were 

required  for  a  precise  prediction  of  plant-scale  gas-exchange  rates  under  soil  water  deficit.  However, 

our  results  indicate  that  under  the  given  grapevine  architecture,  soil  type,  and  meteorological 

conditions, the hydraulic structure has, by far, the largest effect on simulated net photosynthesis and
