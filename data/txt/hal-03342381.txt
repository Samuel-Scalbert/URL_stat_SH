Abstract

During the past decade, the interest in using crop models for research, education, extension,
outreach and in the private sector has rapidly increased. The iCROPM 2020 Symposium
entitled ‘Crop Modeling for the Future’, held in February 2020, therefore, provided a great
opportunity for over 400 scientists from 50 different countries to exchange information on
crop model development, evaluation with experimental data and implementation. A key out-
come was the understanding that crop models simulate the dynamics of the soil-plant-atmos-
phere continuum. Thus, the models can be used for a quantitative and multi-criteria
assessment of cropping system functioning, agronomic performance and environmental
impact. This should result in more practical applications that can provide actionable informa-
tion for stakeholders.

The field of crop modelling is relatively new in the agricultural science discipline compared to
plant breeding, soil physics and soil chemistry, and originated approximately five decades ago.
Some refer to the publication by De Wit (1965) on modelling photosynthesis as one of the
groundbreaking studies on crop modelling in Europe, resulting in the SUCROS and
WOFOST style models that are still being used today (Bouman et al., 1996). In the USA,
the first crop models were based on a systems approach for understanding and improving
crop management, with the GOSSYM-COMAX for cotton irrigation and nitrogen manage-
ment as one of the early success stories (McKinion et al., 1989). A more detailed review of
the history of agricultural system models can be found in Jones et al. (2017).

During the time when the first crop simulation models were developed, there was not much
scope for presenting modelling studies at scientific meetings and publishing modelling results
in society and other scientific journals. Therefore, the Biological Systems Simulation Group
(BSSG) was established in the USA during the 1970s, mainly for an informal exchange on
the development and application of simulation models in agriculture. All presentations were
published as extended summaries in proceedings, but there was, however, limited international
participation. Due to lack of interest and limited funding for travel, the BSSG meetings were,
after more than 40 successful meetings, discontinued. At the same time, the agricultural soci-
eties became more receptive to presentations and especially publications on crop modelling
that included studies on crop model development, improvement and evaluation, and applica-
tions to address real-world problems.

One groundbreaking symposium entitled ‘Modelling Cropping Systems: Science, Software
and Application’ was held in Florence, Italy in 2003 and was sponsored by the European
Society of Agronomy. The outcomes of this symposium resulted in a special publication on
crop models that had been developed by the main modelling groups across the globe (van
Ittersum and Donatelli, 2003). As of today, many of these papers are still very highly cited.
During the 1990s and 2000s, most of the crop modelling activities and associated presentations
occurred during the annual meetings of the European Society of Agronomy, the annual inter-
national meetings of the American Society of Agronomy-Crop Science Society of America-Soil
Science Society of America, and the annual meetings of the American Society of Agricultural
and Biological Engineers. The Agricultural Intercomparison and Improvement Project
(AgMIP; www.AgMIP.org) and the Modelling Agriculture with Climate Change for Food
Security (MACSUR; https://macsur.eu/) project in Europe also facilitated international meet-
ings among agricultural modellers, but focused on climate change impact and adaptation in
agriculture and issues related to food security.

The iCROPM 2016 International Crop Modeling Symposium
held in Berlin, Germany in March 2016 provided a new oppor-
tunity for crop modellers to interact informally and to exchange
information. One of the main goals of iCROPM 2016 was to dis-
cuss the underlying science for crop model development and
improvement,
the collection and application of experimental
data for model evaluation, the advancement of crop model appli-
cations at different temporal and spatial scales, and new software
development associated with crop modelling. The iCROPM 2016
Symposium was very successful and attracted many young scien-
tists from across the globe. Some of the main presentations of the
iCROPM 2016 Symposium were published as scientific papers in
two special issues (Nendel et al., 2018; Thorburn et al., 2018).
Some of the key challenges to crop modelling that were identified
during the symposium included data and especially Big Data,
innovation in modelling and models, credibility of models, cap-
acity building and training, the overall goal of model applications,
and community challenges, such as the involvement of young
modellers and gender issues.

their participation at

The success of the iCROPM 2016 Symposium resulted in the
Second International Crop Modeling Symposium. The iCROPM
2020 Symposium, entitled Crop Modeling for the Future, was
held from 3 to 5 February 2020 at the Le Corum Conference
Center in Montpellier, France. Following the iCROPM 2020
Symposium, the AgMIP crop modelling teams for maize, maize
evapotranspiration, soybean, wheat, low input farming systems,
global gridded crop modelling, crop model calibration, ozone
impact, and extreme events met
for 2 days at Agropolis
International in Montpellier, France. Unfortunately, it was one
of the last ‘in-person’ conferences that was held in 2020 prior
to the termination of all travel and cancellation of in-person meet-
ings due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, several scientists from
China had to cancel
the last minute.
Nevertheless, the iCROPM 2020 Symposium brought together
over 400 scientists representing 50 countries,
including many
young scientists. One of the main goals of the iCROPM 2020
Symposium was to facilitate an informal exchange on the
improvement and application of crop simulation models. The
symposium included six oral sessions that covered topics such
as improvement of crop models, crop modelling for ecological
intensification, linking crop/plant models and genetics, linking
crop models to data streams in the digital age, crop modelling
for impact and risk assessment, and methods and software to sup-
port modelling activities. There were two plenary sessions that
facilitated speed talks on the main crop modelling and software
platforms. For a more informal interaction among the partici-
pants, there were also six poster sessions with the posters on dis-
play for 3 days during the entire symposium. A key outcome of
the iCROPM 2020 Symposium was that we now must clearly con-
sider that crop models are in reality soil-plant-atmosphere models
in which the cycles of water, carbon, nitrogen and sometimes
other nutrients are simulated as the daily or sub-daily interactions
of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Using the crop models
will then allow for a quantitative and multi-criteria assessment
of cropping system functioning, agronomic performance and
environmental impact.

This issue of The Journal of Agricultural Science Cambridge
(Volume 158,
issue 10) is dedicated to the iCROPM 2020
Symposium. It includes six papers that are based on both oral
and poster presentations from the symposium,
including the
final keynote presentation. One of the main goals of this issue
invited presentations that are
is to not necessarily highlight

normally presented by senior and well-established scientists, but
rather to provide opportunities for young scientists to publish
either their oral or poster presentation.

The paper by Gurkan et al. (2020) discusses a crop modelling
study on the potential impact of climate change on sunflower pro-
duction in Turkey for both rainfed and irrigated conditions. The
paper by Sampaio et al. (2020) presents a crop modelling study on
the evaluation of different planting dates and plant densities for
soybean grown in Brazil. The paper by Bracho-Mujica et al.
(2020) addresses the issue of input data requirements for crop
models with emphasis on weather data and the study evaluated
different solutions for scaling. The paper by Khafajeh et al.
(2020) applies a crop simulation model for greenhouse conditions
linked to fuzzy control, a somewhat new and challenging applica-
tion for crop models that are normally developed for field condi-
tions. The paper by Habte et al. (2020) compares two different
crop models for the simulation of rainfed sorghum production
in Ethiopia with emphasis on yield gap analysis.

Finally, the paper by Vasco Silva and Giller (2020) provides a
general perspective on what crop modelling until now has been
able to accomplish and presents a thorough review of the limita-
tions of crop growth modelling. Based on the challenges that are
identified by Vasco Silva and Giller (2020) and a comprehensive
review of the abstracts of the conference contributions, it is clear
that there will be new opportunities for model improvement to
address food and nutrition security in a changing climate. It is
expected that this will result in more practical applications covering
a broader range of relevant topics that are based on scientifically
robust crop models and evaluated with comprehensive data, ultim-
ately resulting in actionable information for stakeholders.
