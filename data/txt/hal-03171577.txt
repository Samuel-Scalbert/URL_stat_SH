Abstract

In this paper, we focus on measuring the dissimilarity between preferences with uncer-
tainty and imprecision, modelled by evidential preferences based on the theory of belief
functions. Two issues are targeted: The ﬁrst concerns the conﬂicting interpretations of
incomparability, leading to a lack of consensus within the preference modelling community.
This discord aﬀects the value settings of dissimilarity measures between preference relations.
After reviewing the state of the art, we propose to distinguish between two cases: indecisive
and undecided, respectively modelled by a binary relation and union of all relations. The
second concerns a ﬂaw that becomes apparent when measuring the dissimilarity in the theory
of belief functions. Existing dissimilarity functions in the theory of belief functions are not
suitable for evidential preferences, because they measure the dissimilarity between prefer-
ence relations as being identical. This is counter-intuitive and conﬂicting with almost all the
related works. We propose a novel distance named Unequal Singleton Pair (USP) distance,
able to discriminate speciﬁc singletons from others when measuring the dissimilarity. The
advantages of USP distances are illustrated by the evidential preference aggregation and
group decision-making applications. The experiments show that USP distance eﬀectively
improves the quality of decision results.

1. Introduction

Preference is a traditional topic in human history and its corresponding study is of great
interest in various domains, such as sociology [1], economy [2], and more speciﬁcally group
decision making [3]. As new applications emerge, preference modelling continues to attract
the attention of recent research communities in computer science, such as social networks [4],
and deep learning communities [5], etc.

In reality, preferences are not always expressed in a ﬁrm or consistent manner, uncer-
tainty and imprecision may exist in preference information, facing unknown situations, or
multiple conﬂicting information sources.
In this paper, we accept terms uncertainty and
imprecision for two diﬀerent concepts of imperfectness. Term uncertainty refers to a degree
of conformity to reality, while term imprecision refers to quantitative default of knowledge
on the information contained. A simple example is given here for a better understanding of
the two terms, while other scenarios of imperfectness are also possible:

Example 1. In the US presidential election of 2020 between Joe Biden and Donald Trump,
two pieces of information are given: the ﬁrst is a statement, saying Joe Biden has 50%
chances to win. The second is a data missing case, interpreted as Biden or Trump will win.

In this example, the ﬁrst case expresses a piece of uncertain preference information, while the
certainty is 50%. The second expresses a piece of preference information with imprecision.
Indeed, the second is an extreme case of imprecision, also known as total ignorance.

Some previous works have already investigated imperfect preferences. For example, the
authors of [6] proposed a fuzzy model to cope with imprecise preferences. Recently, eviden-
tial preference models based on the Theory of Belief Functions (TBF) have been proposed
and attracted much attention in preference modelling venues [7–9]. TBF (also referred to
as Dempster-Shafer Theory [10, 11] or Evidence Theory) is a powerful mathematical tool
for the modelling of uncertainty and imprecision, widely applied in information fusion and
decision making. In addition to the capability of characterizing uncertainty and impreci-
sion, the evidential preference model handles as well the aforementioned ambiguity of the
interpretation of “incomparability”, in a uniﬁed framework.

Knowledge with uncertainty is depicted by degree values on the corresponding event,
while knowledge with imprecision is depicted by the union set of possible singletons. Thus,
the evidential preference model is able to express these two aspects of imperfectness in
preference information faithfully. A more detailed introduction on the TBF and evidential
preference model will be provided later in Section 2.

Dissimilarity measure between imperfect preference relations is another issue targeted in
this work in addition to preference modelling. Dissimilarity plays a vital role in preference-
aware systems concerning various applications. For example, distance-based consensus meth-
ods is an important category in preference aggregation. Indeed, some conventional voting
rules are also considered distance-based consensus methods using diﬀerent distance func-
tions, as explained in [12].
In social network analysis, distances between preferences are
applied for community detection and neighborhood-based recommendation systems [13, 14].
Dissimilarity functions depend predominantly on data representation. For example, for
preferences represented as orders or list-wise, correlation coeﬃcients are widely applied, such
as Kendall’s τ , Spearman’s ρ, Pearson’s r or their extended versions [15]. In the case of a
pair-wise representation of the preferences, dissimilarities are measured between binary rela-
tions [16–19]. Bouyssou et al. [20] mentioned that binary relation is the central tool in most
models of preferences. Thus, measuring the dissimilarity between pairwise preferences is a
fundamental issue. Usually, between any two alternatives ai and aj, four exclusive binary
“strict preference (ai (cid:31) aj)”, “inverse strict preference (ai ≺ aj)”,
relations are possible:

March 17, 2021

3

“indiﬀerence (ai ≈ aj)”, and “incomparability (ai ∼ aj)”. The dissimilarity between prefer-
ence relations are mainly measured through these four relations. However, the deﬁnition of
“incomparability” may correspond to diﬀerent interpretations, resulting in diﬀerent dissim-
ilarity value settings. Two major issues are encountered when measuring the dissimilarity
between evidential preferences. The ﬁrst is caused by the ambiguous interpretations of
incomparability while the second exists in the context of the theory of belief functions.

First issue: diﬀerent interpretations of “incomparability”

Relation incomparability between two alternatives is deﬁned as neither prefer, nor indif-
ferent (with the formal deﬁnition given in Section 2.1). However, this deﬁnition is ambigu-
ous1. In the literature, we have identiﬁed two interpretations of incomparability, considered
either as an indecisive or an undecided situation.

Example 2. Indecisive case: Which job is better? [21]

Alice has two available job oﬀers. The ﬁrst job is poorly paid but corresponds
well to Alice’s interests while the second is well paid but does not match Alice’s
interests. As a consequence, Alice ﬁnds herself in a dilemma when she has to
choose between the two jobs.

In Example 2, incomparability is caused by conﬂicting preferences associated with diﬀerent
criteria, making the decision indeterminable. We interpret this case as indecisive.

Example 3. Undecided case: Missing opinions in Sushi survey. [22]

In the Sushi preference data set, the respondent (agent) is asked to give her/his
preferences on 10 types of sushi randomly selected among 100 sushi types. The
preferences are expressed in the forms of both score and order. However, the
preferences on the other 90 sushi of each agent are missing, making them incom-
parable.

The second example shows a case where incomparability is caused by missing information,
which relates to the ignorance of knowledge. We interpret this case as undecided.

To avoid misleading in engineering aspects, we need to mention that missing information
is not always interpreted as ignorance.
In some scenarios, indiﬀerence or not preferred
could be better interpretations. For example, in democratic voting systems, blank votes are
usually considered as abstention; In a top-k ranking system, alternatives without preference
information are considered as lower-ranked .

Incomparability can be set without controversy when only one of the two situations men-
tioned before exist in the preference-aware systems. However, for the cases that merge with
both situations, it is necessary to distinguish between the two interpretations. Dissimilarity
measures between pair-wise preference relations may encounter such issues.

1The term ambiguous is applied to one identical deﬁnition with multiple possible interpretations.

March 17, 2021

4

Some works (e.g. [23, 24]) diﬀerentiate between the two relations as indiﬀerence and
incomparability, some works interpret incomparability as an absence of knowledge (e.g. [18,
19, 25]), and some works interpret as a speciﬁc case (e.g. [17]). Indeed, this issue exists in
diﬀerent works but has rarely been systematically discussed in the research community.

The ﬂaws of dissimilarity measure are not limited to preferences. In the Theory of Belief
Functions, some problems in dissimilarity measures rise to be important in the evidential
preference model.

Second issue: a ﬂaw in dissimilarity measures in the Theory of Belief Functions

In TBF, each precise event is modelled by a singleton. Dissimilarity values between
diﬀerent singletons are always considered equal in existing measures. This is because two
singletons are considered as either diﬀerent or identical, respecting a binary relation. How-
ever, with this property applied by evidential preferences, dissimilarities between any two
preference relations are equal. A straightforward example is that the dissimilarity be-
tween strict preference and inverse strict preference (denoted as d((cid:31), ≺)) is identical to
the dissimilarity between strict preference and indiﬀerence (denoted as d((cid:31), ≈)), formally,
d((cid:31), ≺) = d((cid:31), ≈). This equality relation is counter-intuition and in conﬂict with all previ-
ous works in preference modelling [16–19, 25, 26].

For the smoothness of writing, related works, as well as comprehensive details about this

ﬂaw, are introduced in Section 2.3, after a preliminary introduction on the TBF.

Contributions

Facing the two issues above, three main contributions are made targeting the issues

introduced above.

– The state of the art in dissimilarity measures over pairwise preferences is reviewed.
Regarding the diﬀerent interpretations of “incomparability”, the disagreements are clar-
iﬁed and characterized through the evidential preference model.

– A novel metric function for dissimilarity measure between evidential preferences is
proposed by extending the existing Jousselme distance [27], named Unequal Singleton
Pair (USP) distance. USP distance takes into account the diﬀerent dissimilarity val-
ues between singletons concerning the second issue and also handles well the case of
imprecise information.

– The proposed USP distance is applied in group-decision making and is compared
with other traditional and recent methods on both synthetic and real-world data sets.
The results show that USP distance improves the quality of group decision making.
Besides, a Condorcet’s paradox elimination method for the evidential preference model
is developed and applied as well.

The merits of the techniques proposed in this paper consist of three main parts, two of which
are related to the evidential preference based on TBF.

– Evidential preferences are able to express imprecise cases, especially missing data cases

faithfully;

– The ambiguous deﬁnition of incomparability is clariﬁed by undecided and indecisive in

a uniﬁed framework in evidential preference;

– USP distance is capable to discriminate singleton elements for decision making with
the imprecise information taken into account. The advantage of this distance is demon-
strated in group decision-making applications based on the evidential preference model.

This paper is organised as follows: preliminary notions on preference modelling, Theory
of Belief Functions, and dissimilarity measures are introduced in Section 2. Afterwards,
the ﬁrst contribution is presented in Section 3, where dissimilarity measures over pairwise
preferences are reviewed. In Section 4, the proposed novel distance for evidential objects
is introduced, named Unequal Singleton Pair (USP) distance, along with a value-setting
example and an application of group decision making. In Section 5, the advantages of USP
distance over the other preference aggregation methods are illustrated with experiments on
the sushi preference dataset in the real-world. Finally, conclusions, as well as important
perspectives are, given in Section 6.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, preliminary knowledge on preferences and the theory of belief functions,

as well as some properties of dissimilarity measures are introduced.

2.1. Preference modelling: background

Preference modelling is usually based on order theory. In this paper, we use the widely

accepted notions in studies of preferences from [28].

Deﬁnition 1. (Binary
alternatives
A = {a1, a2, a3, . . . , aN }, a binary relation R on the alternative set A is a subset of
the Cartesian product A × A, that is, a set of ordered pairs (ai, aj) such that ai and aj are
in A : R ⊆ A × A [28].

Relation) Given

of N

ﬁnite

set

a

Deﬁnition 2. (Preference relation) Between any two alternatives ai, aj, only four relations
possibly exist {(cid:31), (cid:23), ≈, ∼}, deﬁned from binary relation R as:

Strict preference: ai (cid:31) aj ⇔ aiRaj and aj¬Rai;

Indiﬀerence:

ai ≈ aj ⇔ aiRaj and ajRai;
Weak preference: ai (cid:23) aj ⇔ ai (cid:31) aj or ai ≈ aj;
Incomparability:

ai ∼ aj ⇔ ai¬ (cid:31) aj and ai¬ ≺ aj and ai¬ ≈ aj.

March 17, 2021

Relation “weak preference” is the union of strict preference and indiﬀerence. Thus, be-
tween two alternatives ai and aj, the four relations {(cid:31), ≺, ≈, ∼} are exclusive and complete2,
illustrated in Figure 1.

6

Figure 1: Venn diagram of preference relations.

Let R be a binary relation on the alternative set A, we have the deﬁnitions of diﬀerent
orders based on preference structure with relations “strict preference”, “indiﬀerence” and
“incomparability” :

Deﬁnition 3. (Preference Structure) A preference structure is a collection of binary rela-
tions deﬁned on the set A and such that:

– for each couple (ai, aj), ai, aj ∈ A, at least one relation is satisﬁed;

– for each couple (ai, aj), ai, aj ∈ A, if one relation is satisﬁed, any other relation cannot

be satisﬁed.

Deﬁnition 4. (Total/Weak/Partial/Quasi (pre)order)

R is a total order
R is a weak order 3
R is a partial order
R is a quasi-(pre)order

iif. R ∈ {(cid:31), ≺};
iif. R ∈ {(cid:31), ≺, ≈};
iif. R ∈ {(cid:31), ≺, ∼};
iif. R ∈ {(cid:31), ≺, ≈, ∼}.

In this paper, orders without incomparability are called complete orders, i.e. total and

weak orders are complete orders.

Dissimilarity measure for quasi (pre)orders is compatible with all the other three orders
as quasi (pre)order is the most general concept. However, most of the dissimilarity measure
methods are designed for complete orders. The diﬃculty falls on the dissimilarity measure
on relation “incomparable” , with more details given in Section 3.

2As ai (cid:31) aj is equivalent to aj ≺ ai, to avoid repetitive comparisons between two alternatives, we assume

that i < j in this article.

3In some work, weak order is also referred to as “partial ranking”, while “partial order” is another type

of preference structure.

2.2. Theory of belief functions (TBF): notions

Let Ω = {ω1, . . . , ωH} be a ﬁnite set representing all possible status of a categorical
attribute, the uncertainty and imprecision of this attribute is expressed by Basic Belief
Assignment (BBA).

Deﬁnition 5. (Basic Belief Assignment (BBA)) A (normalized) Basic Belief Assignmen
(BBA) on Ω is a function m : 2Ω → [0, 1] such that:

m(∅) = 0 and

(cid:88)

X⊆Ω

m(X) = 1.

(1)

The subsets X of Ω such that m(X) > 0 are called focal elements, while the ﬁnite set Ω is
called discernment framework. Ω is also considered as total ignorance since it represents all
the possibilities. A BBA representing total ignorance (m(Ω) = 1) is also called a vacuous
BBA. A BBA is simple supported if a non-zero value is assigned only on one singleton and
Ω. In this paper, we accept the term evidential object as an object described by imperfect
information with both uncertainty and imprecision. Thus, an evidential object is represented
by a BBA.

Deﬁnition 6. (Categorical BBA) A categorical BBA is a normalized BBA satisfying:

m(X) = 1 , ∀X ⊂ Ω and m(Y ) = 0 , ∀Y ⊆ Ω, Y (cid:54)= X.

(2)

A categorical BBA on element X ∈ 2Ω is denoted as X 0. With the concept of simple support,
we name a categorical BBA on one singleton as categorically simple supported.

In the process of information fusion, where multiple BBAs are combined into one, various
combination rules are available. The selection of a pertinent combination rule depends on
many criteria, in which an important one is cognitively independent.

Deﬁnition 7. (Cognitively Independent Source) Sources are considered as cognitively in-
dependent if the values of BBA on any source has no communication with the others.

The conjunctive combination rule proposed by [29] is applied for ﬁnding the consensus among
multiple reliable and cognitively independent sources, deﬁned as:

mconj(X) =

(cid:88)

S
(cid:89)

ms(Ys).

Y1∩...∩Ys=X

s=1

(3)

For cognitive dependent sources, the mean value rule is commonly applied. Given a
discernment framework Ω and sources S, BBA on source s ∈ S denoted as ms, for ∀X ∈ 2Ω,
mean value combination is deﬁned as follows:

mmean(X) =

1
S

S
(cid:88)

s=1

ms(X).

(4)

These two combination rules are applied in the evidential preference aggregation process,

with details given in Section 4.5.

2.3. Properties of dissimilarity measures over evidential objects

Metrics, or distance functions are usually applied to measure the dissimilarity between

two objects.

Deﬁnition 8. (Metric (distance)) A metric (distance) function d on a set T is deﬁned as:
d : T × T → R≥0,
where R≥0 denotes the set of non-negative real numbers. Given any three elements
ti, tj, tk ∈ T , the following conditions are satisﬁed:

1. d(ti, tj) ≥ 0 :
2. d(ti, tj) = 0 ⇔ ti = tj :
3. d(ti, tj) = d(tj, ti) :
4. d(ti, tj) ≤ d(ti, tk) + d(tk, tj) :

non-negativity;
identity of indiscernible;
symmetry;
triangle inequality.

(5)

Usually, the term dissimilarity refers to semi-metric, in which the property of triangle

inequality does not hold.

In TBF, diﬀerent dissimilarity measures are applicable to BBAs. From geometrical
and statistical views, these measures are categorized into three parts: distance [27, 30],
conﬂicts4 [31], and divergence [32]. Comprehensive surveys are respectively available in [32]
and [33]. We only introduce the properties required in this paper.

As BBAs are deﬁned in space of 2Ω, in addition to the properties for metrics in Equa-
tion set (5), properties considering the structure of discernment are speciﬁcally required in
TBF. The authors in [33] resumed three structural properties: Strong structural property
(with consideration of the interaction between focal elements), weak structural property
(with consideration of the cardinality of focal elements), and structural dissimilarity (with
consideration of the interaction between sets of focal elements). We accentuate the strong
structural property hereby, which is the strictest one.

Property 1. Strong structural property: A distance measure function d between two
BBAs m1 and m2 is strongly structural if its deﬁnition accounts for the interaction between
the focal elements of m1 and m2.
According to [33], the structural property is usually considered as the axiomatic metric
property for distance measure between evidence objects. A popular distance that is strongly
structural is Jousselme distance [27], deﬁned as:

dJousselme(m1, m2) = (cid:112)(m1 − m2)T J acc(m1 − m2),

where J acc is the matrix whose elements are Jaccard indices:

Jacc(X1, X2) =

|X1 ∩ X2|
|X1 ∪ X2|

, for X1, X2 ∈ 2Ω \ ∅.

(6)

(7)

Matrix J acc is positive deﬁnite and the properties of metric (Equation set (5)) hold in
Jousselme distance, proved in [34].

4Strictly, “conﬂict” is not a dissimilarity measure, or semi-metric, as the identity of in-discernment prop-

erty does not hold.

3. Contribution I: A synthetic review of dissimilarity measures over pairwise

preferences

Dissimilarity measures over preferences can be grouped into two categories: between pair-
wise preferences (binary relations) and between list-wise preferences (preference orders). In
this section, the former one is focused, where axiomatic distances and Hamming distance are
mostly applied. Among these distances, diﬀerent value settings concerning incomparability
are accepted, caused by the ambiguous interpretations aforementioned.
In this section,
starting with a synthetic review of dissimilarity over pair-wise preferences, we introduce how
the evidential preference model distinguish these interpretations in a uniﬁed framework.

3.1. Axiomatic distances

In axiomatic distances, axioms are used to help to deﬁne values of dissimilarity between
preference relations. These axioms are extracted either from the deﬁnitions or intrinsic prop-
erties of preference relations. Axiomatic distances were originally proposed for preference
aggregation in distance-based consensus models.

Early research was initiated by Kemeny and Snell [16], where a model for combining
preferences (in weak orders) into a group consensus was proposed (a.k.a. Kemeny-Snell
model, marked as KS model in this paper). However, the deﬁnition given in [16] to the
partial order does not include relation indiﬀerence since it supposes that an alternative ai
is either preferred or incomparable to another alternative aj. J.M. Blin [25] adopted the
KS model and proposed an aggregation method by distance minimization. Cook et al. [26]
In
(marked as CS model) consider incomparability by introducing a comparison matrix .
the CS model, the incomparability is deﬁned as not compared while the axioms respect
deﬁnitions in Figure 1. Roy and Slowinski [17] (marked as RS model) proposed logical
conditions to build a distance measure between pairs of binary relations. The authors in [18]
(marked as KM model) respected the RS model and suggested a dissimilarity measure with
supplementary conditions. Then, Jabeur et al. [19] proposed numeric values for dissimilarity
measure between diﬀerent relations based on [18] (marked as JMK model) by taking the
centroid value in a restrained space created by the axioms. In this paper, we refer to the
distances applied in diﬀerent models by corresponding model names.

Several contradictions exist within these models, as depicted in Figure 2, where Ω denotes

the ignorance of knowledge. In the RS model, incomparability is interpreted as:

Incomparability relation is the aﬃrmation of the incapacity to establish the rela-
tion type: there is no indiﬀerence, no weak preference and no strict preference
between the two alternatives [17].

This interpretation matches the Venn diagram in Figure 2a. However, in other models, such
as CS, KM, and JMK models, incomparability is interpreted as the two alternatives are not
compared (i.e. undecided ). This interpretation corresponds to the illustration in Figure 2b.
Axioms accepted in each model are listed in Table 1. These axioms concern the preference
relations (cid:31), ≺, ≈, ∼, ? where the symbol ? represent ignorance induced from the undecided
case, (i.e. ? = {(cid:31) ∪ ≺ ∪ ≈ ∪ ∼}). Distance function between preference relations is

denoted by d∆. In order to distinguish the two interpretations of incomparability, we remark
axioms on the undecided version as BIS.

Axiom 2 implies that (cid:31) and ≺ are opposite relations, and symmetric to indiﬀerence
≈. Axiom 6 indicates that strict preference and inverse preference relations are most dis-
tinguished. CS and KM models accept the interpretation of undecided for incomparability,
referring to the knowledge of ignorance. CS and KM models confuse the deﬁnition of “in-
comparability” with “ignorance”, where “ignorance” is caused by having no knowledge of the
preference relation.

Apart from axiomatic preference distances, Minkowski distances based on the encoding
of diﬀerent preference relations are often applied. The most popular one is the Hamming
distance.

3.2. Hamming distance

Hamming distance for preference relation is based on the encoding of preference. Given
two alternatives ai and aj, preference relations are encoded in binary by ﬂattening preference
matrix, with corresponding Hamming distance values resumed in Table 2.

3.3. Summary of distances between pair-wise relations

The inequality relations applied in each distance are summarized in Figure 3. An impor-

tant advantage of axiomatic methods is that these dissimilarity measures are metrics with
the properties guaranteed. However, the above research works show that the dissimilarity
measures vary with diﬀerent axioms accepted, these methods have a strong dependency on
the interpretation of diﬀerent preference relations.

3.4. Clariﬁcation of “incomparability” in evidential preference model

The diﬀerent interpretations of incomparability can be simultaneously characterized by

the evidential preference model in a uniﬁed framework.

The evidential preference model is originally proposed by [8] on weak orders (corre-
sponding to Figure 2b) and extended to quasi orders (corresponding to Figure 2a) with the
consideration of incomparability by [9]. Consider the case that a set of agents U expressing
their preferences between every pair over alternative set A. Each agent is a source, denoted

March 17, 2021

as u, u ∈ U. For any alternative pair ai, aj ∈ A, four relations are possible. Therefore, the
discernment framework Ωpref

is deﬁned as:

ij

12

Ωpref

ij = {ωR

ij|R ∈ {(cid:31), ≺, ≈, ∼}}.

(8)

In evidential preference, the case of undecided is characterized by total ignorance Ωpref
,
while the case of indecisive by a speciﬁc binary relation incomparability ω∼
ij . Therefore,
diﬀerent interpretations are distinguished in a uniﬁed framework. The degree of uncertainty
on preference relation is represented by values on singletons, which can be regarded as a
fuzzy value5. The imprecision is characterized by values on union sets.

ij

With the combination rules in the framework of the theory of belief functions, the ev-
idential preference model is eﬀective in group decision-making with imperfect preference
information sources. A more in-depth discussion on this topic is given in Section 4.5.

4. Contribution II: USP distance - A novel measure suitable for evidential pref-

erences

Despite that evidential preference can faithfully express all types of preference, none of
the existing distances in the context of the theory of belief functions is able to properly
measure the dissimilarity between evidential preferences, with aforementioned inequality
relations respected. In this section, we analyze the properties that disable a relevant dis-
similarity measure and propose a new distance adapted to evidential preferences, namely
Unequal Singleton Pair (USP) distance. The analysis starts with a detailed introduction to
this ﬂaw.

4.1. A ﬂaw in the dissimilarity measure over evidential preferences

The fact that existing distances in the theory of belief functions are not relevant for
evidential preference is caused by a contradiction between their required properties.
In
Section 3, it is concluded that Equation (9) is always applied in measuring the dissimilarity
between preference types.

d∆((cid:31), ≺) > d∆((cid:31), ≈).

(9)

This inequality relation is rewritten as Equation (10) adapted to evidential preferences.

d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≺}0) > d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≈}0),

(10)

where {ωR}0 represents the categorical BBA on singleton element ωR (see Deﬁnition 6).

However, the existing dissimilarity measures do not distinguish values between singletons
in TBF, thus, none of them satisﬁes Equation (10).
In TBF, a discernment framework
(Ω = {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωH}) requires that all the singleton elements are mutually exclusive (see

5This fuzzy value does not represent a fuzzy preference. Conventional fuzzy preference express the relation
between two alternatives by only one membership with 1 representing strict preference, 0 the reverse strict
preference, and 0.5 the indiﬀerence.

Section 2.2). With the property of exclusivity, any two elements ωi, ωj ∈ Ω are either
identical or distinguished, with respect to a binary relation. Existing distances apply this
binary relation by an assumption that dissimilarity values between singleton elements are
equal, precisely:

13

Assumption 1. In a discernment framework Ω = {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωH}, the dissimilarity be-
tween any two diﬀerent singletons is a constant (normalized as 1), formally, ∀ωm, ωn ∈
Ω, ωm (cid:54)= ωn,

d({ωm}0, {ωn}0) ≡ 1.

(11)

Obviously, Equation (10) and Equation (11) are contradictory. As a consequence, As-
sumption 1 is not suitable for measuring the dissimilarity between evidential preferences.
To propose a theoretically correct solution, an analysis of necessary properties for evidential
preferences is conducted.

4.2. Dissimilarity measure properties for evidential preferences

Three essential properties are required for dissimilarity measures on evidential prefer-

ences.

Property 2. The dissimilarity is measured by a metric, i.e. the properties of metric (Def-
inition 8) hold.

Property 3. The dissimilarity measure takes the diﬀerence of dissimilarity between single-
tons into account.

Property 3 abandons Assumption 1. With the account that dissimilarities are measured
between BBAs in the space of 2Ω, the following property must hold as well, matching the
property of strongly structural (see Property 1 in Section 2.3), Speciﬁcally described as:

Property 4. Dissimilarity function d forms with such structure:

∀X, Y ∈ 2Ω, d(X 0, Y 0) ≤ d({X \ (X ∩ Y )}0, Y 0).

(12)

By applying these properties on weak orders, represented by Ω = {ω(cid:31), ω≺, ω≈}, the dissim-
ilarity values are set as:

d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≺}0) = 1;

d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≈}0) = d∆(≺, ≈) =p.

(13a)
(13b)

where p is a dissimilarity value between 0 and 1 (strictly smaller than 1).

With respect to Equation (12), the three relations below yield:

March 17, 2021

1. Between strict preference (cid:31) and union with indiﬀerence ≈:

Symmetrically,

d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω(cid:31), ω≈}0) < d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≈}0)
⇒ d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω(cid:31), ω≈}0) ∈ (0, p).

d({ω≺}0, {ω≺, ω≈}0) < d({ω≺}0, {ω≈}0)
⇒ d({ω≺}0, {ω≺, ω≈}0) ∈ (0, p).

2. Between strict preference (cid:31) and total ignorance (missing data):

d({ω(cid:31)}0, Ω0) > d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω(cid:31), ω≈}0).

Symmetrically,

d({ω≺}0, Ω0) > d({ω≺}0, {ω≺, ω≈}0).

14

(14a)

(14b)

(15a)

(15b)

3. Between strict preference (cid:31) and union of other two preference types (≺ and ≈):

d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≈}0) < d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≺, ω≈}0) < d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≺}0).

(16a)

Symmetrically,

d({ω≺}0, {ω≈}0) < d({ω≺}0, {ω(cid:31), ω≈}0) < d({ω(cid:31)}0, {ω≺}0).

(16b)

To apply Properties 2, 3, and 4, we propose Unequal Singleton Pair (USP) distance as a

solution.

4.3. USP distance–a distance for unequal singleton pairs over BBAs

In TBF, Jousselme distance[27] is widely applied because this distance is strongly struc-
tural by taking into account the imprecision in the structure with respect to Property 2
and Property 4. Inspired by the methodology in the conception of Jousselme distance, we
propose a novel distance named Unequal Singleton Pair (USP) distance, with the Property 3
imposed.

Assumption 1 is guaranteed in by Jaccard index (Equation (6)), with Property 4, recalled

here:

Jacc(X1, X2) =

|X1 ∩ X2|
|X1 ∪ X2|

, for X1, X2 ∈ 2Ω \ ∅.

To drop Assumption 3, we deﬁne USP distance by modifying Jaccard index matrix as follows.

dU SP (m1, m2) = (cid:112)(m1 − m2)T Sim(m1 − m2),
where Sim diﬀers from J acc, also referring to the similarity matrix between diﬀer-
In Sim, the similarity value between two elements X1 and
ent singleton elements.
X2, (X1, X2 ∈ 2Ω) is denoted as sim(X1, X2).
In the ﬁrst place, with a similar form

(17)

March 17, 2021

15

as Jaccard index, sim(X1, X2) is deﬁned as the division between two virtual functions:
resemb(X1, X2, . . . , XM ) and entire(X1, X2, . . . , XM ):

sim(X1, X2) =

resemb(X1, X2)
entire(X1, X2)

,

(18)

where resemb(X1, X2) describes the cause of the similarity between X1 and X2 (say re-
semblance), and entire(X1, X2) the entire part concerned by X1 and X2.
resemb(·)
functions. With Assumption 1, the functions
and entire(·) are deﬁned as virtual
resembass1(X1, X2, . . . , XM ) and entireass1(X1, X2, . . . , XM ) are overrode as:

resembass1(X1, X2, . . . , XM ) =|

entireass1(X1, X2, . . . , XM ) =|

M
(cid:92)

Xi |,

i=1
M
(cid:91)

Xi | .

i=1

(19)

(20)

Obviously, the similarity matrix Sim is identical to Jaccard matrix J acc.

Here, we propose a new method to drop Assumption 1. Deﬁne a set of elements in 2Ω,
W = {X1, X2, . . . , XM }, therefore W ⊆ 2Ω. Denote resemb(W ) for resemb(X1, X2, . . . , XM )
and entire(W ) for entire(X1, X2, . . . , XM ) to simplify the expression. The size of W is
deﬁned by the number of elements X ∈ 2Ω, denoted by |W |. Singletons in W is deﬁned by
the union of all elements in W , formally:

∪W =

(cid:91)

Xi.

Xi∈W

(21)

Denote the subset of W by Wsub, by dropping Assumption 1, entire(W ) is deﬁned as a

generalized version of cardinal function on the union sets:

entire(W ) =

(cid:88)

ω∈∪W

entire(ω)

t=1

Wsub⊆W,|Wsub|=t

resemb(Wsub) × (−1)t.

(22)

In practice, with only the similarity between two singleton elements given, a unique
solution for entire(W ) may not be reached by Equation (22). To enable and simplify the
calculation, two more assumptions are imposed, deﬁned as follows.

March 17, 2021

16

Assumption 2. In a set of exclusive elements Ω = {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωH}, any resemblance is
only shared by maximal two elements, formally:

resemb(W ) = 0,

∀W ⊆ 2Ω, |W | ≥ 3.

(23)

Assumption 2 guarantees that a unique solution exists for resemb(ωm, ωn) with only pairwise
similarity sim(ωm, ωn) given.

Assumption 3. To normalize the element values in the calculation, entire part concerned
by one singleton is assigned to 1, formally:

entire(ω) = 1,

∀ω ∈ Ω.

(24)

With Assumptions 2 and 3, given similarity sim(ωm, ωn), the resemblance is calculable and
a unique solution exists. Deduced from Equation (22), we have:

entire(X, Y ) =

(cid:88)

ω∈X∪Y

entire(ω) −

(cid:88)

ωm∈X
ωn∈Y
m(cid:54)=n

resemb(ωm, ωn).

(25)

Hence, Equation (18) is overrode as:

resemb(ωm, ωn)

(cid:88)

ωm∈X1
ωn∈X2
m(cid:54)=n

sim(X1, X2) =

(cid:88)

ω∈X1∪X2

entire(ω) −

(cid:88)

ωm∈X1
ωn∈X2
m(cid:54)=n

resemb(ωm, ωn)

.

(26)

To guarantee the Assumption 2 given by Equation (23), the following condition holds:

sim(ωm, ωn) ≤ 1.

(27)

(cid:88)

ωm,ωn∈Ω
ωm(cid:54)=ωn

Property 2 (property of the metric system) is guaranteed because the USP distance is in
the format of the Mahalanobis distance. Moreover, extended from the Jousselme distance,
Property 4 is kept by diﬀerent values in the similarity matrix Sim.

For a better understanding, we demonstrate the inference and calculation of the USP
distance in the evidence preference by a graphical illustration, followed by an application of
decision-making thereafter.

4.4. Illustrative example-USP for evidential preferences

The calculation of the similarity matrix can be aided by graphics as depicted in Figure 4.
Evidential preference is taken as an example, with four singletons elements: ω(cid:31), ω≺, ω≈ and
ω∼.
In accordance with the exclusivity of the discernment framework, Figure 4a shows

March 17, 2021

that singletons do not share any overlapped parts. Obviously, Figure 4a is isomorphic with
Figure 1. In the conception of USP, we assume that the pairwise dissimilarity diﬀerence
between singletons can be described by an overlapped zone in another space than the one in
which they are deﬁned. More precisely, outside the original S space, the singletons can have
an overlapping part in a diﬀerent S ∗ space, represented by the overlapping space between
singletons in ﬁgure 4b. In this way, the overlapped part could be used to show the diﬀerence
in dissimilarities between the singletons elements.

17

(a) Element in original space S.

(b) Element in space S ∗ with diﬀerent similarity val-
ues.

Figure 4: Graphical representation of similarity matrix calculation.

Thus, the overlap area in space S ∗ allows calculating the similarity between simple
elements. In addition, the constraints set by the functions Assumption 2 and Assumption 3
are respectively interpreted as the overlapped zones are shared by 2 elements, and the area
of an element is valued as 1.

Table 3 gives the similarity values between ωR, R ∈ {(cid:31), ≺, ≈, ∼}. The function resemb(·)

resemb(ω(cid:31), ω∼) = resemb(ω≺, ω∼) = p2;
resemb(ω≈, ω∼)
= p3.

(28)

Plugging Equation (28) in Equations (24) and (25), the following relations are estab-

lished:

Equation set (30) deﬁnes the limit of value setting, guarantee axiomatic properties, and
metric properties. With this dissimilarity value calculation method, we apply USP distance
in group decision-making applications.

4.5. Application: Group decision making

The USP distance ﬁnds its application in group decision making between pairwise alter-
natives, represented by ai, aj ∈ A. Respectively, the discernment framework is designated
by Ωij (see Equation (8)) and the decided relation by Rij. The procedure consists of two
steps: combination and decision, as shown in Figure 5.

Rij ∈ {(cid:31), ≺, ≈, ∼}

Figure 5: Group decision making procedure.

As mentioned above, in CS and KM models, incomparability interprets the absence of
information, (referred to as undecided ), however, the ﬁnal consensus decision strategies are
possible to converge to the absence of information (undecided ) as a consequence, which is
meaningless in decision making. To solve this problem, the conjunctive combination rule for
BBAs is more adaptable. More speciﬁcally, LNS-CR (Conjunctive Rule for Large Number of
Sources) [35] is applied as it is suitable for the aggregation of preferences without uncertainty,
represented by categorically simple supported BBAs (see Deﬁnition 6).

In the decision step, a distance-based strategy is applied, which is originally introduced

in [36], deﬁned by:

March 17, 2021

Rij = argmin

(d(mΩij , {ωR}0)),

R∈{(cid:31),≺,≈,∼}

19

(31)

where mΩij denotes a BBA for the evidential preference between the alternatives ai and
aj, and {ωR}0 the categorical BBAs respectively representing the relations (cid:31), ≺, ≈, and
∼. With USP distance applied in the decision rule above, the dissimilarities in singleton
pairs are signiﬁcantly discriminated against. The advantages are further discussed with
experiments in Section 5.

5. Illustrative examples and experiments

In this section, three experiments are conducted. In the ﬁrst experiment, we compare
decision-making methods by examples on synthetic data with traditional methods, the im-
pact of missing data is particularly studied.
In the second experiment, we compare the
diﬀerences between USP distance and Jousselme distance in decision making, particularly
confronting a Condorcet Paradox. Afterwards, in the third experiment, group decision mak-
ing is evaluated based on real-world Sushi preference data.

5.1. On synthetic data

In the ﬁrst and second experiments, preferences are generated in quasi order with missing
data. That is to say, between alternatives ai and aj, in addition to the four preference
relations (cid:31), ≺, ≈, and ∼ (indecisive), the case of missing information (undecided ) is also
considered, denoted as ?.

5.1.1. Exp. 1: Impact of missing data in preference aggregation

Firstly, preference aggregation results with diﬀerent numbers of each preference relation
are compared. Following aggregation rules compatible with quasi order are considered:
Borda rule, distance-based consensus rule with KM distance and CS distance, evidential
preference with Jousselme distance (denoted as EPJ ), and with USP distance (denoted
as EPU SP ).
In Section 3.1, we mentioned that KM and CS models are not applicable
to measuring incomparability as indecisive. To make a fair comparison, preferences with
incomparability interpreted as undecided (denoted with the symbol ?) rather than indecisive
(∼) are generated. Since traditional preference models without uncertainty are compared,
BBAs are categorical in the evidential preference model.

To calculate USP distance, similarity values corresponding to Figure 6 are applied, where
extreme values are taken, i.e. the equality conditions in Formulas (30) are accepted. Table 4
illustrates the agent number settings, with #(cid:31), #≺, #≈, #∼. #? denoting the number of
agents giving each preference relation. These numbers are particularly set to highlight the
diﬀerences among aggregation strategies.

Aggregation results are illustrated in Table 5. EPXSand EPXΩ respectively represent
the decision on a singleton (in space of Ωpref ) and the power set (in space of 2Ωpref ) with the
evidential preference model. X is written as J and U SP to respectively denote Jousselme
distance and USP distance. Only non-zero values in the combined BBAs are illustrated in

column “combined BBA” (without the value on ∅). From the results, we draw the following
conclusions:

1. In N ◦1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, KM and CS models return undecided case (denoted by ?). This
indicates that consensus rules based on axiomatic distances are not appropriate when
a big part of data is missing.

2. From N ◦1˜6, we observe that Ω (equivalent to the undecided case ?) is one of the
possible decision results in EPJ Ω and EPU SP Ω. This issue is similar to the above one
and reﬂects that decisions in space of 2Ω are easily inﬂuenced by missing data.

3. The decision result from the Borda rule is always precise. However, relations ≈, ∼
and ? are not distinguished. Indeed, the Borda rule merely compares the number of
(cid:31) and ≺ with other types of preferences neglected.

4. In strategies for evidential preference model, between two distances in settings N ◦ 3
and 4, EPU SP S gives a more precise result than EPJ S. This is because those decisions
on singletons are discriminated against with USP distance.

5.1.2. Exp. 2: Condorcet’s paradox avoidance in preference aggregation

Condorcet’s paradox is a traditional issue in preference aggregation problems, reﬂecting
a phenomenon that collective preferences are cyclic while all agents’ preferences are not.
An initial discussion and with an avoidance solution evidential preference model is intro-
duced in [9]. In this experiment, we demonstrate diﬀerent results between EPU SP and EPJ
strategies concerning Condorcet’s paradox.

In Figure 7, we generate BBA of three agents U = {u1, u2, u3} expressing their uncertain
preferences on three alternatives A = {a1, a2, a3}. The aggregation results decided by rules
EPJ and EPU SP are illustrated in Figure 8. It can be observed that EPJ decision strategy
returns a cyclic preference order, indicating Condorcet’s paradox, while EPU SP decision
strategy returns indiﬀerence among the three alternatives. This shows the advantage of
USP distance. Still, we need to point that EPU SP does not deﬁnitively eliminate Condorcet’s
paradox. The example here demonstrates only a speciﬁc case. Condorcet’s paradox is not
deﬁnitively avoided by EPU SP . To avoid Condorcet’s paradox, we develop an elimination
method for the evidential preference model.

We denote the set of edges (preference relations) as:

where i, j are the index of alternative pair (ai, aj) in the cyclic graph representing Condorcet’s

to the categorical BBA of its opposite relation {ωRoppo

This method takes the idea from Dodgson’s voting method [37], and it degrades to Dodg-
son’s method in traditional cases when preferences are certain. This method for Condorcet’s
paradox elimination is applied in the following experiment on data from the real world.

5.2. Exp. 3: Aggregation of conﬂicting preferences over Sushi preference dataset

In this part, we demonstrate the group decision-making with USP distance in the eviden-
tial preference model on the preference dataset [22] (referred to as SUSHI in the following
text). In this dataset, only three preference relations exist between any two alternatives:

March 17, 2021

23

(cid:31), ≺ and ≈. Missing data are considered as total ignorance in the evidential preference
model as (cid:31) ∪ ≺ ∪ ≈.

Several most recent Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods are compared
with our method. [38–41]. We have chosen PROMETHEE-EDAS [39], TOPSIS-WAA [40],
and 3WD-MADM method [41]. These three methods are fuzzy extensions of traditional
PROMETHEE [42], TOPSIS [43] and ELECTRE I [44] respectively, which are classic
MCDM solutions. Besides, these methods are recent enough to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness
of the proposed method. It should be pointed out that the group decision-making method
based on evidential preference is only adaptable for mono-criteria, where each alternative
is represented by a single value. To adjust the MCDM method for group decision making,
the score of each agent is considered as a criterion of alternatives. For example, the scores
given by agents u1, u2, u3 alternatives a1, a2, a3 are represented by matrix H, as shown in
Table 6. The weight of each criterion (agent) is identical and all agents play a beneﬁcial role
in MCDM.

The order data are converted into a score from 9 to 0, with the most preferred given 9
and least given 0. To apply the fuzzy MCDM method and normalize the score, both score
and order data are fuzziﬁed by:

F uzzy(ai, uj) =

Score(ai, uj)
max(Score(ai, u)|u ∈ U))

,

(33)

where Hij represents score on alternative ai from agent uj.

These methods do not consider incomplete cases. Therefore, they are not directly appli-
cable for Sushi preference data. For comparison, missing data are completed by the average
value of all existing data from agents in the corresponding region.
In the 3WD-MADM
method, only the average strategy is compared. Due to the consequence of the data comple-
tion strategy that alternatives are close, in parameter selection of ELECTRE I for outrank-
ing calculation, we have chosen a relatively small concordance threshold pELECT RE = 0.55
and large discordance threshold qELECT RE = 0.45. For a similar reason, the threshold
in PROMETHEE-EDAS linear preference function pP ROM ET HEE should be small. We ﬁx

pP ROM ET HEE = 0.05 in the preference function integrated within PROMETHEE-EDAS.
Without speciﬁc description, parameters are selected by default values as in [39–41].

Introduction to Sushi preference dataset

SUSHI gathers the preferences of voluntary agents located geographically in the eastern
region (3257 agents) and western region (1742 agents) across Japan (respectively referred
to as East and West Japan). Agents are required to express their preference over 10 sushis
randomly selected from 100 sushis. The preferences are expressed in two forms: score and
order. Scores range from 0 to 4 (5 levels in total). The sparsity of data is therefore 90%. In
this case (preferences are given in two forms), the contradiction is inevitable. For example,
between two sushis magoru and ebi, an agent may give magoru (cid:31) ebi in order but with
identical scores. Details of the data set are depicted in Table 8.

more oily sushi
less oily sushi

The study of Japanese food sociology tells some ground truth knowledge. People from
East and West Japan have diﬀerent taste preferences on Sushis. Generally, Japanese from
East Japan prefer more oily and saltier food than from West Japan. The oily level denoted
by oil ∈ [0, 4] is also provided for each sushi type. Originally, level 0 refers to the oiliest one
and 4 the least. For the consistency with literal signiﬁcance, we inverse the order, i.e. 0
refers to the least oily and 4 the most.

Aggregation and evaluation

In SUSHI, the responses in score and order from an identical agent are cognitively de-
pendent. Therefore, the mean rule (Equation (4)) is suitable for the aggregation of personal
preference. The preference aggregation procedure is illustrated in Figure 9, as an extended
version to Figure 5 in Section 4.5.

The evaluation of preference aggregation results is tricky. If an evaluation criterion on
aggregated preference is ﬁxed, it is possible to ﬁnd a method based on the optimization

March 17, 2021

25

of this criterion. Therefore, the aggregation results are usually evaluated by the eﬀects or
consequences, such as feedback of services [45, 46] or knowledge of ground truths. These
criteria require additional information.

In our experiments, we evaluate the preference aggregation results in two aspects. Firstly,
we focus on the consensus degree between the ﬁnal result and each expert. Secondly, we
compare the result with the ground truth knowledge in terms of food habits in Japan. In the
ﬁrst evaluation, the Average Deviation Index (ADI) is applied, deﬁned in Equation (34) [47]:

ADI =

(cid:88)

s∈S

τ (σagg, σs),

(34)

where, σagg refers to the aggregated preference order, σs the preference order of agent s, and
τ the normalized Fagin distance [15].

Table 9 summarizes the ADI of all methods in comparison, including four rules of eviden-
tial preferences on orders and scores. We observe that the decision rule of EPU SP provides

aggregation result with more consensus than EPJ , on both scores and orders. Besides,
EPU SP returns a similar result as TOPSIS-WAA, with a little improvement. The results of
3WD-MADM and PROMETHEE-EDAS are relatively unsatisfactory. The reason is sim-
ilar: 3WD-MADM is calculated based on pairwise rankings with integrated ELECTRE I.
PROMETHEE-EDAS is calculated based on in/out ﬂow on pairwise alternatives. Since the
data set is highly sparse and missing values are ﬁlled in with the mean value of observed
data, most criteria are identical between two alternatives, and the distances between alter-
natives are relatively small. In the result of ELECTRE I, almost half of the alternatives in
our experiments are indiﬀerently ranked as least preferred. In the result of PROMETHEE,
most preferences are weak, which the ranking result unreliable.

However, ADI is not always a convincing and reliable homogeneous evaluation criterion.
Lower ADI can be reached by applying a Kendall distance τ minimization strategy. This
also explains the satisfactory performance of EPU SP . Indeed, in cases without uncertainty
nor imprecision, the average value of USP distance between two preference orders is identical
to Kendall distance with Fagin’s extension [48].

To give a more concrete conclusion, in the second place, the preference aggregation results
are evaluated with a piece of sociology knowledge in Japan about eating habits: people from
east Japan usually prefer more oily sushi than people from west Japan. If the aggregated

March 17, 2021

26

preferences can successfully discriminate the oiliness choice largely from the other region, the
aggregation rule is believed to be appropriate. Thus, for veriﬁcation, the average oiliness
index (AOI) is implemented to the whole aggregated preference order. With the oiliness
degree of sushi ai denoted by oil(ai), we deﬁne AOI on the set of sushi Asushi as:

AOI(Asushi) =

1
|Asushi|

(cid:88)

oil(ai).

ai∈Asushi

(35)

The comparison of AOI on top-k sushis between East and West Japan is calculated respec-
tively upon the diﬀerence:

Figure 10: Sushi AOI diﬀerence between East Japan and West Japan.

Figure 10 depicts the AOIdif f of top-k preferred sushi decided by all methods in com-
parison, with k varying from 5 to 100. For 3WD-MADM, k varies from 5 to 40 as the last
60 sushis are all considered indiﬀerently as not preferred. According to the deﬁnition of AOI
in Equation (36), positive AOIdif f means oily sushi is more preferred in east Japan than in
west Japan, and vice versa for negative AOIdif f values. It is obvious that AOIdif f has posi-
tive values globally across diﬀerent k values for decision rules based on both Jousselme and
USP distance, especially for top-10 sushis. The results of EPU SP and EPJ correspond gen-
erally the sociological knowledge mentioned before. Nevertheless, around k = 20, AOIdif f
values drop to negative, for the reason that, the 19th and 20th favorite sushis in the order
are much less oily in the east than in the west Japan. The result of TOPSIS-WAA has a

similar trend with EP methods but corresponds less with the sociology knowledge. 3WD-
MADM and PROMETHEE-EDAS return rather random results. This does not imply that
these two methods are ineﬀective in decision-making. Indeed, the unsatisfactory results are
mainly caused by the data completion strategy. With most of the missing data completed
by the mean value, the diﬀerence between alternatives is relatively little. Therefore, MCDM
methods based on preference intensity encounter problems in distinguishing the alternatives.
Still, we need to note that people in east Japan prefer more oily sushi is a rough piece of
knowledge rather than a strict rule. This statement does not imply that all oily sushi should
be preferred in east Japan than west, and it is common that some oily sushis are preferred
in both regions, as the existence of several oily sushi more welcomed in east Japan is always
reasonable.

6. Conclusion and discussion

In this paper, we originally bring the discussions on the ambiguity in the interpretation
of incomparability. We ﬁnd that most of the previous studies do not distinguish between
interpretations of incompatibility according to diﬀerent situations. In some works, incom-
parability is interpreted as undecided because of certain criteria, while in others it is inter-
preted as undecided because of a lack of observed information. This ambiguity could lead
to controversy in dissimilarity values, especially for pair-wise preference relations. More-
over, reasoning the undecided case as indiﬀerence is not a faithful way and may lead to
unexpected consequences. This issue has rarely been discussed in the research community.
Therefore, in order to clarify the diﬀerent dissimilarity measures at the deﬁnition level, we
identify and categorize the two interpretations of incomparability as indecisive and unde-
cided respectively. With the help of the evidential preference model based on the theory
of belief functions, we are able to distinguish indecisive and undecided interpretations and
indiﬀerence relation faithfully in a uniﬁed framework: the indiﬀerence and indecisive cases
are exclusive with other preference relations by being considered as speciﬁc binary relations,
while the undecided case of incomparability is considered as total ignorance represented by
the union of all possible relations.

In the second place, we reveal a ﬂaw in existing dissimilarity measures in the theory of
belief functions while applied on evidential preferences after a thorough study on existing
distances between preference relations. Due to the property of belief functions, dissimilar-
ities between exclusive singletons are considered equal, which raises a contradiction with
all previous works in preference modelling. Obviously, this property of belief functions is
not suitable for evidential preferences. To solve this issue, we propose a novel dissimilarity
measure function, named USP distance, for BBAs (evidential objects with both uncertainty
and imprecision). USP distance is an extension of Jousselme distance, which takes the dif-
ference of dissimilarity between singletons into consideration. In the case that dissimilarities
between diﬀerent singletons are equal, USP distance degrades to Jousselme distance. USP
distance is applied in group decision making with evidential preference and shows a better
performance than Jousselme distance. The advantages of USP distance are also justiﬁed by
experimental comparison with several MCDM methods.

March 17, 2021

In this paper, the application of USP distance is limited in evidential preference aggre-
gation. USP distance can have more potential utilities in decision making, not only limited
in the circumstances of preference modelling. For example, in a decision system where some
alternatives are riskier than others, it is unfavourable to choose the risky alternatives. Tra-
ditionally, such discrimination is realised by utility functions, as introduced in [49]. USP
distance brings another possible solution. By assigning the pair-wise dissimilarity with
diﬀerent values, singletons are possible to be discriminated against by USP distance. A
comparative study between the two solutions is in the scope of our future work.

Moreover, other distance-based applications, notably learning tasks on evidential objects
with USP distance, are left to be justiﬁed. Here, we propose a potential issue in this task
as a discussion topic without being solved, with the example of clustering over evidential
preferences. Clustering preferences is an important technique, especially in recommendation
systems and social networks where users are proﬁled by their preference information. For
orders consisting of crisp preference relations, the USP distance degrades to Kendall’s τ
distance in total orders and Fagin’s distance [48] in weak orders. Thus, it is appropriate
to apply USP distance for the classiﬁcation on complete preference orders. A similar ap-
plication using Jousselme distance has been justiﬁed in [50]. Nevertheless, for incomplete
and imprecise preferences, where the impact of ignorance is important, an issue becomes
obvious: the missing preference information modelled by vacuous BBAs (see Deﬁnition 5)
are identical and are classiﬁed into the same group based on the dissimilarity. With such
results, imprecise information is brutally clustered into crisp clusters, losing the signiﬁcance
of clustering over preferences. A more rational classiﬁcation result should be that these vac-
uous BBAs are not classiﬁable, i.e. the membership of these vacuous BBAs to any group is
also a knowledge of total ignorance. Therefore, it is reasonable to doubt the appropriateness
of existing distance functions in the theory of belief functions, including USP distance. Gen-
erally speaking, this issue is due to the failure of existing distances measuring over evidential
objects with imprecision. To deal with this issue, a study on the properties of dissimilarity
measure for learning tasks over evidential objects is necessary within the scope of our future
work.
