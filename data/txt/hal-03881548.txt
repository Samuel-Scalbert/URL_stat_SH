Abstract 
Background:  High-throughput phenotyping is crucial for the genetic and molecular understanding of adaptive root 
system development. In recent years, imaging automata have been developed to acquire the root system architec-
ture of many genotypes grown in Petri dishes to explore the Genetic x Environment (GxE) interaction. There is now 
an increasing interest in understanding the dynamics of the adaptive responses, such as the organ apparition or the 
growth rate. However, due to the increasing complexity of root architectures in development, the accurate descrip-
tion of the topology, geometry, and dynamics of a growing root system remains a challenge.

Results:  We designed a high-throughput phenotyping method, combining an imaging device and an automatic 
analysis pipeline based on registration and topological tracking, capable of accurately describing the topology and 
 t. The method was tested on a challenging Arabidopsis seedling dataset, 
geometry of observed root systems in 2D 
including numerous root occlusions and crossovers. Static phenes are estimated with high accuracy ( R2 = 0.996 and 
0.923 for primary and second-order roots length, respectively). These performances are similar to state-of-the-art 
results obtained on root systems of equal or lower complexity. In addition, our pipeline estimates dynamic phenes 
accurately between two successive observations ( R2 = 0.938 for lateral root growth).
Conclusions:  We designed a novel method of root tracking that accurately and automatically measures both static 
and dynamic parameters of the root system architecture from a novel high-throughput root phenotyping platform. 
It has been used to characterise developing patterns of root systems grown under various environmental conditions. 
It provides a solid basis to explore the GxE interaction controlling the dynamics of root system architecture adaptive 
responses. In future work, our approach will be adapted to a wider range of imaging configurations and species.

Background
Plants  expand  their  root  system  to  meet  their  needs  for 
water  and  nutrients.  Root  system  shape,  structure,  and 
plasticity  impact  its  efficiency  and  condition  the  plant 
fitness  in  fluctuating  environments  [1].  The  root  system

architecture (RSA) is dramatically affected by spatial and 
temporal  changes  in  the  soil  environment  that,  in  turn, 
will modify its water and nutrients capture efficiency [3]. 
These adaptive responses, including branching angles and 
frequencies of lateral roots, rely on growth rate modifica-
tions of the different root classes (e.g., primary, seminal, 
lateral, or adventitious roots). The optimal distribution of 
roots in a given environment allows plants to forage effi-
ciently for resources. There is a need to explore the link 
between  RSA  and  its  dynamics,  plant  physiology,  and 
agronomic traits to implement plant breeding programs

[19]. Such goals involve designing non-destructive high-
throughput phenotyping systems. Non-destructive meas-
urements  are  indispensable  to  periodically  quantify  the 
phenotype of the same plant all along time and then deci-
pher  the  dynamics  of  the  adaptive  responses.  Because 
roots  are  the  below-ground  organs  and  represent  the 
hidden half of the plant, non-destructive root phenotyp-
ing  is  technically  challenging  for  high  throughput.  One 
approach  to  quantify  root  growth  and  geometry  under 
a  wide  range  of  growth  conditions  is  to  use  a  transpar-
ent medium, such as agarose gels, a common cultivation 
practice  for  the  model  plant  Arabidopsis  and  other  spe-
cies.  Several  semi-automatic  tools  have  been  developed 
to  assist  root  phenotyping  on  agar  plates  [10,  23,  25, 
27,  35].  However,  these  devices  are  either  limited  in  the 
number of plates imaged or restricted in temporal reso-
lution.  This  situation  hampers  potentially  useful  pheno-
typical parameters of individual roots that may be linked 
to the temporal dynamics of growth. Here we present the 
HIgh Resolution ROot Scanner (HIRROS), an automated 
and  non-destructive  visualisation  automaton  for  200 
Petri dishes and an image analysis pipeline allowing high-
throughput  temporal  phenotyping  of  seedlings  RSA.  to 
support the massive phene collection required for proper 
genetic studies in response to fluctuating environments.

Automatic  extraction  of  RSA  is  a  current  bottleneck 
and  an  active  topic  in  bio-image  analysis.  The  commu-
nity  attempts  to  develop  solutions  to  process  root  sys-
tems 2D images [16, 34, 35], 3D CT observations [11, 12, 
21],  or  multi-angle  3D  reconstructions  [33];  see  [26]  for 
a detailed description of standard root system phenotyp-
ing setups. The proposed processing pipelines for recon-
structing  RSA  from  2D  or  3D  images  typically  include 
a  step  of  image  segmentation  (root  detection  and  back-
ground  removal)  and  a  step  of  RSA  reconstruction  by 
optimal path search in the segmented structures [23, 35]. 
The first step is a pixel classification task,previous works 
proposed  various  segmentation  techniques,  including 
pixel  classifiers  controlled  by  fixed  or  trainable  param-
eters  [5,  29].  Recent  works  exhibit  significant  advances 
using deep convolutional networks [23, 32, 35]. Unfortu-
nately, these methods require vast training data and offer 
no guarantee when applied to a new dataset with differ-
ent  characteristics  (species,  observation  device,  bogus 
phenotype).  Some  authors  partially  addressed  this  con-
cern using transfer learning [35], allowing the end-user to 
transfer the method to a new dataset after re-training the 
network.

The  second  step,  aiming  at  RSA  reconstruction,  relies 
on  algorithms  extracting  root  paths  from  segmented 
structures, interpreting pixel sets as connected root sys-
tems  to  output  higher-level  primitives,  i.e.  plant  organs 
and  connections.  Biologists  need  to  assess  that  this 

reconstruction  process  solves  the  architecture  at  the 
organ  scale.  This  feature  is  required  to  distinguish  local 
responses  from  systemic  responses  (elongation  speed, 
branching  density)  [30,  31,  22],  but  offering  such  guar-
antees  remains  a  challenge. There  are  several  difficulties 
in  current  solutions,  mainly  due  to  the  capacity  to  deal 
with  root  intersections  and  root  contacts  [10,  33,  35]. 
Each  new  crossing  doubles  the  number  of  possible  root 
paths,  which  causes  a  combinatorial  explosion  of  the 
reconstruction problem (see Fig. 1). Some authors admit-
ted  that  the  root  crossing  issue  is  a  significant  failure 
cause  without  proposing  any  solution  to  tackle  it  [33]. 
A  global  optimization  algorithm  could  provide  an  opti-
mal solution to this problem. However, the most popular 
approach  in  the  literature  is  reconstructing  the  differ-
ent organs sequentially [35]. This method is more or less 
equivalent to addressing the root crossing problem with a 
greedy algorithm, leading to local optima.

With  the  development  of  high-throughput  time-lapse 
observations, there is a shift to spatiotemporal data, add-
ing  another  layer  of  complexity. The  most  common  way 
to  achieve  spatiotemporal  architecture  reconstruction 
is  to  consider  time  points  as  separated  data. These  time 
points  are  processed  using  the  conventional  two-step 
pipeline  before  exploring  the  correspondences  between 
the  extracted  architectures  over  time.  This  operation 
requires  advanced  matching  methods  [2,  10,  33]  and 
extra  processing  steps  that  could  induce  a  performance 
drop when cumulating the errors of the separate recon-
structions.  Some  authors  attempted  to  integrate  tempo-
ral information in the reconstruction process to address 
this  issue.  Gaggion  et  al.  [10]  sidestep  the  geometric 
alignment  task  by  fixing  the  specimen  on  the  imaging 
device  during  the  time  course.  With  this  setup  guaran-
teeing  a  proper  alignment  of  the  successive  observa-
tions,  the  authors  enhance  the  temporal  consistency  of 
the obtained segmentation using a weighted average over 
the time series. The drawback of this method is the need 
to provide N observation devices for the N specimen (or 
for the N petri dishes, eventually), which is incompatible 
with  high-throughput  experiments.  Finally,  Yasrab  et  al. 
[36] proposed a novel perspective on the whole problem, 
training a Future-GAN network to reproduce the devel-
opmental  behaviour  of  the  root  systems.  This  method 
showed  high  performance  for  geometry  reconstruction 
but is prone to errors in topology reconstruction.

Fig. 1  Challenges of root system architecture reconstruction. Left, an image of Arabidopsis seedlings with a developed architecture, observed in 
a petri dish. A When observed in 2D, these root systems exhibit numerous root crossings, which induce possible root tracking errors, and can even 
fool experts when annotating static images without a “temporal insight.” In addition, multiple roots can follow each other for an arbitrarily long time 
(B), making them hard to disentangle. Finally, second-order roots sometimes hide below the primary root (C), and roots from two adjacent plants 
could cross (D). These points are severe issues for static reconstruction algorithms and greedy reconstruction processes, requiring addressing this 
problem with a 2D

processing  2D + t  data.  First,  a  registration  pipeline  is 
built  to  address  the  alignment  issue. Then,  root  systems 
are segmented and labelled with root apparition time. A 
novel root topological tracking algorithm is applied that 
combines  temporal  and  spatial  information  and  solves 
ambiguities introduced by root crossing. This pipeline is 
applied  on  1000  time-lapse  images  of  Arabidopsis  roots 
grown  in  petri  dishes  (N = 1000  plants  observed  during 
21  timesteps,  timestep = 8  h),  and  the  result  is  saved  in 
the  RSML  format  [17],  enabling  the  extraction  of  new 
spatiotemporal  phenes.  Our  automatic  pipeline,  evalu-
ated over N = 200 plants imaged and expertized over 21 
timesteps, shows state-of-the-art performances on high-
throughput  data.  Finally,  the  development  of  architec-
tures is reconstructed from time-lapse, providing unseen 
insights into root system growth.

Methods
HIRROS: automated platform for RSA imaging

The HIgh Resolution ROot Scanner (HIRROS) setup is a 
device  for  automated  and  non-destructive  visualisation 
of  root  growth  and  architecture  of  Arabidopsis  thaliana 
plants or small seedlings (Fig. 2). The imaging automata 
is located in a dedicated growth chamber allowing tem-
perature, hygrometry, photoperiod, and light intensity to 
be  adjusted  according  to  the  user’s  requirements  (Root 
phenotyping platform webpage: [24]).

HIRROS 

is  designed 

to  use  either  200  small 
(120 × 120 mm) or 72 large (245 × 245 mm) square Petri 
dishes,  which  are  filled  with  agar  medium  and  placed 
upright  in  holders  to  allow  root  growth  along  a  verti-
cal  plane  at  the  surface  of  the  culture  medium.  Once 
the  medium  is  solidified,  a  one-centimetre  wide  strip  of 
medium  is  removed  to  avoid  contact  of  cotyledons  and 
leaves  with  the  culture  medium  and  maintain  shoots 
vertically  (Fig.  2).  Plate  lids  are  wiped  with  tween20  to 
reduce  condensation  and  water  droplet  formation.  Five 
pre-germinated  seedlings  are  evenly  distributed,  and 
the plates are sealed with four pieces of tape to allow gas 
exchanges. The Petri dishes are then placed into holders 
to maintain them vertically and make them transportable 
within  the  automated  HIRROS  setup.  Holder  motions 
are driven by worms allowing lateral and forward move-
ments. The imaging system that is protected from para-
sitic light is located beside the culture zone (Fig. 2). Plates 
are  transferred  to  the  imaging  cart.  For  illumination, 
the  plates  are  backlighted  with  a  white  collimated  LED 
(Fig.  2).  This  allows  a  high  contrast  (even  for  thin  and 
almost translucent Arabidopsis roots) and reduces reflec-
tion on the plate’s lid. Plates are imaged using a 16MP lin-
ear camera coupled to a telecentric lens located at 50 cm 
of the plate (Fig. 1). This optical setup increases the depth 
of  field.  It  suppresses  image  distortions  allowing  imag-
ing of small and large plates without adjustment. It has a

culture zone (right side of the device). The rack moves to the imaging area (C) for image acquisition, and the plate is pushed in the imaging with a 
moving arm. Once the image is captured, the plate moves back to its initial location, and the rack moves to image the next plate. Once all plates 
are imaged, the rack moves back to the culture zone to proceed to the next one. Representative original grayscale image of Arabidopsis seedlings

locally in a folder labelled with the experiment informa-
tion  and  the  imaging  date.  Illumination  is  switched  on 

and off automatically and synchronised with the camera 
during image acquisition. Once imaged, the plate moves 
back  to  the  holder  that  moves  one  position  further  to 
place the next Petri dish in the row in front of the imag-
ing  cart  until  all  plates  are  recorded.  The  holder  moves

back to the culture zone, and the next holder enters the 
imaging process. The imaging frequency can be adjusted 
between 2 and 24 h, and up to 1000 plants can be imaged 
in less than 80 min.

Image processing pipeline

Our  processing  pipeline  includes  four  steps  (see  Fig.  3): 
(1)  time  series  registration,  (2)  2D + t  segmentation,  (3) 
root  topological  tracking,  and  (4)  architecture  recon-
struction.  It  is  fully  automatic.  The  batch  computation 
starts  as  soon  as  the  user  provides  the  indication  of  the 
source image directory.

First,  all  the  images  in  the  time  series  are  registered 
together in order to align root organs in all images to ease 
the tracking process. Then, in the second step, root pix-
els  are  separated  from  the  background  (segmentation), 
and an apparition time is associated to the root pixel that 
corresponds to the time associated with the image in the 
time  series.  A  single  2D  labelled  image  is  output  where 
each pixel is labelled with a root apparition time.

The two final steps work on graph and tree data struc-
tures. In step 3, the label image is converted into a graph 
representing  the  successive  growing  parts  of  roots.  The 
adjacency relations of the root segments are investigated 
by  an  optimization  algorithm  to  estimate  the  topol-
ogy of the root system architecture. Finally, in step 4 we 
refine the geometrical description of this architecture by 
computing  the  central  line  of  the  identified  organs.  The 
detailed description of these steps is presented below.

alignment: (i) movements of the box relative to the imag-
ing device and (ii) deformations of the root system in the 
culture medium induced by plate displacement. We cor-
rect these distortions using a registration pipeline devel-
oped with the Fijiyama plugin libraries [8].

mation  Tt  comprises  a  rigid  transformation  (transla-
tion + rotation),  and  a  non-linear  transformation  (dense 
vector  field)  estimated  successively.  In  this  setup,  we 
assume  that  the  rigid  transformation  is  required  to  cor-
rect  the  movement  of  the  plate,  while  the  non-linear 
transformation is required to correct the slight deforma-
tions  of  the  root  system  in  the  culture  medium.  These 
transformations  are  computed  from  local  correspond-
ences using the blockmatching algorithm [28], integrated 
into a daisy-chain strategy: each image is registered with 
the  next  image  in  the  sequence.  Then  the  successive 
transformations  are  composed  and  applied  at  once  for 
each image.

Time series segmentation

The image time series shows the roots growing over time. 
The difference between two successive images highlights 
the  newly  appeared  segments  of  the  roots.  By  working 
on  these  differences  over  the  image  sequence,  one  can 
distinguish  the  roots  from  the  image’s  background,  thus 
segmenting roots and associating each root segment and 
apparition time. Thus, we define the two purposes of this 
segmentation step: (i) identify which image pixels are tra-
versed  by  the  root  systems  during  the  sequence  (binary 
segmentation of RSA), and (ii) estimate the correspond-
ing traversal times (see Fig. 4).

In our dataset, background pixels have medium inten-
sity  while  root  pixels  have  low  intensity.  However,  seg-
menting  roots  by  thresholding  each  image  separately  is 
not an option, as other structures (box border, condensa-
tion, dirtiness) may have similar characteristics to roots, 
and  pixels  intensity  varies  between  the  root  central  line 
(low intensities) and root border (medium intensities).

Nevertheless,  the  registered  image  sequence  allows 
studying  the  time  sequence  of  intensities  of  each  pixel 
and detecting in this sequence the event associated with 
the  detection  of  a  root  (i.e.,  when  a  root  reaches  this 
pixel). The time sequence of intensity of a pixel traversed 
by  a  root  begins  with  high  values  corresponding  to  the 
background, then undergoes a sudden decrease of inten-
sity at the moment when the root reaches this pixel, and 
finally finishes with low values corresponding to root tis-
sues. We process each pixel individually and identify this 
pattern  by  computing  the  maximum  mean  shift  over  its 
time series of intensity. We identify as “root pixels” those 
whose mean shift value is greater than a fixed threshold 
25 (given that the average intensity difference meas-
s1
ured  between  the  centerlines  of  the  roots  and  the  back-
ground  is  approximately  100).  Among  these  pixels,  we 
compute the difference between successive values in the 

=

time sequence and identify the observation time follow-
ing  the  maximal  intensity  drop.  If  this  maximum  inten-
10 , the pixel 
sity drop is lower than a fixed threshold s2
is  rejected  and  identified  as  background.  Else,  the  index 
of the maximal intensity drop is identified as the “appa-
rition  time”  of  the  root  at  this  given  pixel  location.  The 
pixels selected by these two thresholding operations con-
stitute  a  binary  segmentation  of  the  root  systems.  Each 
selected pixel is given a label defining the root apparition 
time (see Fig. 4).

=

We run a topological and geometrical characterisation 
of the binary segmentation of the root systems to elimi-
nate various outliers: nightly condensation and dirtiness 
falling  on  the  dish  during  the  experiment.  We  compute 
the  4-connected  components  and  reject  the  pixels  of 
components  smaller  than  2000  pixels.  In  our  setup,  this 
threshold is barely equivalent to rejecting any candidate 
root system in which cumulative organ length at the last 
observation  time  point  is  lower  than  38  mm,  which  is 
suited to our experiment.

This segmentation step results in a 2D labelled image S 
(see Fig. 4), whose pixels  p are given a label S(p) between 
0 and Nt ; the label “0” identifies non-root pixels, and the 
other possible labels identify the index of the first image 
where the root is present.

Root topological tracking

In  this  section,  the  pipeline  converts  the  2D  labelled 
image  into  a  graph  representing  the  root  system  archi-
tecture.  This  graph  is  extracted  by  investigating  the 
adjacency  relations  between  the  detected  root  grow-
ing  sections,  and  connecting  these  sections  in  the  most 
plausible  way,  using  a  connection  metric  used  to  com-
pute a minimal cost tree with an optimisation algorithm. 
Multi-particle  tracking  can  be  challenging,  especially  if 
the  number  of  particles  is  not  constant,  which  requires

managing the creation and destruction of tracks in time 
[18].  An  additional  difficulty  comes  when  the  temporal 
sampling  is  sparse  with  respect  to  the  particle  velocity, 
inducing  possible  confusion  between  crossing  tracks  or 
neighbouring tracks. For the tracking of roots in the time 
series, we propose a solution based on a global tracking 
algorithm  working  on  the  full-time  series.  In  the  previ-
ous step, the pipeline outputs the growing architecture as 
a fixed architecture with time-stamped elements. During 
root  topological  tracking,  the  method  tracks  structures 
by  using  these  timestamps.  In  steps  3-a,  the  algorithm 
computes a directed Region Adjacency Graph equivalent 
to the segmentation. In 3-b, it extracts a covering forest 
of  minimal  weight  from  it,  and  provides  the  skeleton  of 
the  primary  and  secondary  roots.  Then  in  3-c,  it  pro-
cesses  the  root  crossings  by  a  global  optimization  algo-
rithm (see Fig. 5).

labelled 1 (sequence start) and finishing with the label Nt 
(last observation time point). We formalise a global solu-
tion to the tracking problem by searching a minimum cost

normalised vector.

The  weight  p(e)  of  an  edge  is  small  (the  edge  is  more 
“likely”  to  belong  to  an  actual  root  trajectory)  if  (i)  the 
edge  connects  two  vertices  which  have  a  comparable 
surface, (ii) the two vertices labels (structures apparition 
time) are close, and (iii) the vector connecting the target 
from the source is directed downwards, which is the pre-
ferred orientation of root growth.

Extraction of root system skeleton  At this step, we extract 
the root systems skeleton in the graph by identifying the 
paths  corresponding  to  primary  roots  and  lateral  roots 
without  considering  lateral  root  crossings.  We  describe 
this reconstruction algorithm for architecture composed 
of  primary  roots  and  lateral  roots  (second-order  organs 
inserted  on  the  primary),  which  is  suited  to  arabidopsis 
seedlings.

Primary  roots:  The  primary  root  of  seedlings  is  the 
first organ of the root system and tends to be larger than 
the  lateral  roots,  have  a  higher  growth  rate  and  point 
downwards. Consequently, the corresponding path in the 
graph is composed of edges of minimum weight p(e). At 
the beginning of the experiment, we assume that the pri-
mary axes of the N plants (Np = 5 plants per box in our 
setup)  have  no  branching.  We  then  identify  the  corre-
sponding vertices in G, which are the Np vertices associ-
ated with the largest connected component of timestamp 
1 in the segmentation S. From each of such vertices, we 

extract  the  path  of  the  primary  axis,  which  is  the  long-
est  greedy  min-cost  path.  Vertices  and  edges  traversed 
in this step are labelled primary, and all other edges and 
vertices  in  G  are  labelled  lateral.  In  agreement  with  the 
root hierarchy, all lateral edges incident to a primary ver-
tex are invalid and eliminated from the graph. Finally, the 
algorithm filters out outliers by computing an extraction 
of  connected  components  in  G  from  the  primary  verti-
ces  and  rejecting  all  vertices  not  included  in  the  final 
components.

Lateral  roots:  The  algorithm  identifies  the  path  cor-
responding  to  lateral  roots  by  selecting  in  the  graph 
the  vertices  and  edges  that  are  likely  to  correspond  to 
actual  lateral  root  paths  (see  Fig.  5). This  action  of  clas-
sifying  between  “relevant”  and  “irrelevant”  edges  is  an 
action  of  graph  pruning  that  we  run  in  two  steps.  First, 
we  aim  to  extract  a  subpart  of  the  graph  whose  topol-
ogy  corresponds  to  that  of  a  set  of  root  systems,  which 
is a forest structure. To that end, we extract a forest from 
the  graph  by  computing  the  minimal  directed  spanning 
(V F , EF ) using the Edmonds algorithm [7]. In 
forest F
F , each vertex has a single incoming arc. Second, we try 
to  ensure  that  each  path  corresponding  to  a  lateral  root 
has no branching, according to our dataset composed of 
Arabidopsis seedlings. In order to avoid the branching of 
lateral roots, we check each lateral vertex and keep only 
their min-cost outgoing arc.

=

Resolution  of  root  crossing  ambiguities  By  pruning  the 
graph,  parts  of  actual  root  paths  corresponding  to  root 
crossings  could  be  disconnected.  This  point  is  investi-
gated and processed in this step using a global algorithm. 
If a root r2 crossed the path of another root r1 during the 
time sequence, assuming that r2 traversed the area at least 
one timestep after r1 , the region adjacency graph in 3-a) 
shows a typical “X” pattern, where the path of r2 cross at 
least one edge in the wrong direction. This pattern leads 
to an upstream disconnection of the r2 path and a down-
stream disconnection of the r2 path during graph pruning 
in 3-b), which lets an additional root start and root end in 
the graph (see Fig. 5). To process these cases using a global 
algorithm, we first identify the two following vertices sets 
in : the “root starts” Vstart , including every lateral vertex 
with no incoming arc, and the “root stops” Vstop , includ-
ing every vertex with no outgoing arc. As these elements 
are possibly parts of disconnected pathways, we target to 
identify  the  best  pairwise  matches  (root  stops  with  root 
starts) in order to reconnect them. We define a connec-
tion cost function to compute the optimal set of pairwise 
matches  between  elements  of  these  two  sets.  The  cost 
function is defined to indicate the likelihood of the con-
nection,  computed  as  the  weighted  average  of  multiple 
geometrical and topological continuity features, replaced 

Fernandez et al. Plant Methods          (2022) 18:127 

Page 9 of 19

by  majoring  values  when  the  elements  to  connect  are 
not long enough to provide the needed information. The 
features  used  for  the  cost  function  are  the  edge  weight 
function  p(a) (see 3-a), the angle between root start and 
root  end,  the  relative  speed  difference  between  the  root 
start and the root stop, and a topological score. The topo-
logical score is computed by evaluating the minimal path 
between the root end and root start in the original region 
adjacency graph, evaluating the number of edges crossed 
in  the  right  or  wrong  direction,  and  the  corresponding 
temporal distance. We evaluate this cost function for all 
the possible ordered pairs (vstop, vstart ) in order to build a 
cost matrix of all possible one-to-one connections of root 
starts and root stops. This cost matrix is used to compute 
the optimal pairwise matching using the Hungarian algo-
rithm [14]. The algorithm works as follows:

when  a  lateral  root  grows  hidden  below  a  primary  root 
(see results, Fig. 7D).

Artefacts rejection  We compute statistics over the iden-
tified lateral root paths and proceed to detection of outli-
ers in order to reject spurious lateral roots. To that end, 
we collect data characterising the geometry and dynam-
ics  of  these  paths,  measured  at  each  timestep:  length, 
speed,  and  surface.  These  scalar  values  are  binned  with 
respect  to  the  temporal  distance  from  the  emergence  of 
the path. Then we compute robust statistics within these 
subgroups.  We  compute  the  double-sided  MADe  [15] 
and detect values exceeding twenty-five times the median 
absolute  deviation  around  the  median.  These  abnormal 
values  are  identified  as  markers  of  spurious  roots.  The 
corresponding roots are then rejected as artefacts.

While  the  Hungarian  algorithm  provides  a  global  and 
optimal  set  of  connections,  we  do  not  apply  this  set  in 
one  go.  We  iterate  over  these  steps:  computation  of  the 
Hungarian algorithm, connection of the pair of minimal 
cost, and update of the cost matrix. That way, each new 
connection  adds  knowledge  to  the  system.  This  point  is 
critical  for  tackling  some  challenging  cases,  like  when  a 
single  root  is  reconstructed  from  a  series  of  numerous 
small isolated elements comprising both a root start and 
a  root  end.  This  kind  of  situation  happens  for  example, 

Architecture reconstruction

The  reconstruction  of  the  spatiotemporal  model  of  the 
RSA  involves  a  precise  description  of  the  topology  and 
geometry  of  the  root  systems.  At  step  4,  the  pipeline 
refines  the  geometric  description  of  the  root  system 
architecture  by  identifying  the  successive  positions  of 
root  tips  and  interpolating  the  path  of  the  root  tips  to 
extract the central lines of the organs. Vertices and edges 
of the forest F resulting from step 3 describe the root sys-
tem  topology.  However,  they  do  not  provide  the  precise

spatiotemporal  pathway:  each  vertex  of  F  represents  a 
growing region of root pixels between two observations; 
thus, it is not associated with any exact coordinates, nei-
ther in time nor space. To build a precise spatiotemporal 
model, we need to know the precise position of each root 
tip  at  each  observation  time  point  and  then  interpolate 
this position between the time points to follow the roots’ 
actual pathway, whatever their speed and tortuosity.

∈

=

=

The  position  of  the  root  tip  at  each  time  point  can  be 
estimated  from  the  edges  of  the  forest  F ,  recalling  that 
each  edge  e
F  corresponds  to  a  transition  between 
two consecutive growth areas of a root (see Fig. 6). Thus, 
edges  of  F  correspond  to  the  successive  positions  of 
root  tips  at  each  time  point.  The  spatiotemporal  model 
(VI , EI )  of 
is  then  represented  by  the  dual  graph  I
(VF , EF )  where  a  vertex  encodes  the  spatiotempo-
F
ral  position  of  a  root  tip  and  an  edge  encodes  the  root 
segment between two positions (see Fig.  6). In this dual 
graph  (Fig.  6,  right),  a  vertex  w
I  corresponds  to  an 
edge  in  F .  Its  temporal  coordinate  is  well-defined;  it  is 
exactly an observation time point.

Conversely,  the  spatial  coordinates  of  w

I  have  to 
be  defined.  w  corresponds  to  an  adjacency  relationship 
between  two  distinct  connected  components  in  S  (see 
the  blue  line  and  the  blue  arrow  in  Fig.  6,  centre).  We 
define the geometry of this adjacency in the image space 
by extracting the set of pixel edges and corners separat-
ing the two adjacent components. We choose the spatial 
I to be the coordinates of the central-
coordinates of w
most pixel corner or pixel edge over all the correspond-
ing  frontiers  (see  the  dark  blue  circle  in  Fig.  6,  centre). 
We  process  all  the  edges  of  F  that  way  to  compute  the

corresponding  vertices  of  I .  Afterward,  we  create  for 
each root an additional vertex w
I to identify the root 
tip.  We  estimate  its  position  by  identifying  the  pixel  of 
the last component that is the most distant (geodesically) 
from the nearest identified vertex w
I  (for an illustra-
tion, see the lower white circle in Fig. 6, right). Once all 
the vertices of I are computed this way, we connect them 
with edges corresponding to the vertices of F . The geom-
etry  of  the  edges  is  defined  by  straight  lines  connecting 
successive  positions  of  root  tips.  These  edges  consti-
tute  an  oversimplified  version  of  the  root  curves,  which 
do  not  precisely  follow  the  roots  pathway,  especially  for 
primary  roots,  which  are  growing  very  fast.  We  refine  I 
to  ensure  geometrical  fidelity  of  the  RSA  model,  allow-
ing  accurate  measurements  (especially  root  length).  For 
each edge ε
I , we compute the shortest path 
between w1 and w2 in the corresponding connected com-
ponent CC
S . We use the Dijkstra algorithm and com-
pute  the  shortest  path  of  8-connected  pixels  in CC .  We 
define the edge cost using the standard inter-pixel euclid-
ean distance, weighted by a scalar function derived from 
the  distance  map  of  the  traversed  pixels  to  the  contour 
of the CC . This morphological feature forces the path to 
avoid understeering curves; it fosters representative RSA 
models.

Finally,  we  reduce  the  number  of  points  in  the  pixel 
path  by  decimating  it  using  the  Douglas-Peucker  algo-
rithm  [6].  The  temporal  coordinate  of  the  vertices  is 
estimated  by  a  linear  interpolation  computed  from  the 
nearest  two  bounding  vertices  whose  temporal  coordi-
nates are known.

Fig. 7  Performances in the estimation of static traits by comparison between predicted and expertized data. Traits investigated are: A primary root 
length, B total second-order root length, and C number of second-order roots. The three red points in A–C are outliers that were not considered 
for linear regression (in blue). The four images, D–G present the source image and its associated reconstructed RSA. Each corresponds to a point 
in graphs A–C. In D, the reconstruction process captured the architecture efficiently despite many ambiguities: numerous root crossings and a 
second-order root following the trajectory of the primary root. The three outliers E–G occurred in unexpected situations leading to significant 
reconstruction errors. In E an active bacterial strain is present on the path of the primary root, yielding a false positive of the primary root detection 
at an early stage and the interruption of the primary axis path. In F the root reaches the bottom of the petri dish. While this common situation 
generally does not impact the reconstruction, in this case, a dark structure at the bottom of the dish is interpreted as the subsequent path of the 
primary root. In G the primary root is infected with a bacterial strain. As the bacterial strain develops, the root exhibits a rapid increase in apparent 
thickness, interpreted as the emergence of many lateral roots

Upstream

during  the  time  course,  inducing  false  detection  of  new 
organs. We address this problem by artificially removing 
the falling leaves from the images using a series of mor-
phological  operations.  However,  this  results  in  a  loss  of 
information  about  the  primary  and  lateral  root  starts, 
causing  the  pipeline  to  detect  the  root  system  initiation 

point below the target point (the seed). The pipeline cor-
rects this defect during this post-processing operation by 
computing a pixel path of minimum cost from the target 
height to the detected initiation point using the Dijkstra 
algorithm. To that end, we define the cost of pixel-to-pixel 
traversal as the product of the inter-pixel distance (1 for 
pixel sharing an edge or √2 for pixel sharing a corner) by 
the average intensity of the two pixels.

Downstream extrapolation of the stopped laterals  After 
computation,  we  check  every  root  end,  and  investigate 
the  one  ending  before  the  last  observation  time,  prob-
ably corresponding to lateral roots stopping their growth 
before the sequence ending. Such an event is infrequent, 
thus suspect. If these early-stopping roots rstopped are not 
incident to any other root, we consider that rstopped have 
stopped its growth. In that case, we keep it in the model 
if  it  has  a  continuous  growth  during  at  least  three  time 
points,  or  we  reject  it  instead.  In  the  other  case  where 
rstopped is incident to another earlier root rﬁrst , we assume 
that rstopped continued its growth hidden below or paral-
lel to rﬁrst . In this situation, we extrapolate the growth of 
rstopped to its estimated final position in the time-sequence 
and add these new points to the RSA model.

Pipeline validation
We  built  an  annotated  dataset  for  validation  purposes. 
In  this  section,  we  detail  the  procedure  and  the  dataset 
involved in these experiments.

Validation methodology

Assessing  the  pipeline’s  performance  involves  confront-
ing the pipeline’s outputs with corresponding data anno-
tated  by  an  expert  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  analysis 
and  identify  drawbacks.  We  reused  and  modified  the 
Smartroot  software  library  [16]  to  develop  an  ImageJ 
plugin to edit the pipeline’s output. Our plugin provides 
a  simple  GUI  to  navigate  an  RSA  model  in  2D + t  and 
apply  elementary  editing  operations:  adding,  modifying, 
and removing a root or a vertex. Each edition operation 
takes place in 2D + t. After each operation, the topology 
is  checked  automatically  to  correct  the  graph  if  needed. 
The  expert  stops  editing  the  RSA  model  when  he  esti-
mates  that  both  the  topology  and  geometry  are  valid  at 
each  time  point  of  the  sequence  of  observations.  In  our 
dataset,  the  mean  number  of  operations  to  correct  the 
RSA of a single plant was 15.4 ± 6.3 operations per plant 
(mean ± standard deviation).

Validation dataset

The  entire  dataset  was  acquired  within  a  seven  days 
period. It contained  Ntot = 1000 plants, divided into 200 
petri  dishes  loaded  into  HIRROS.  Experiments  took 
place  over  160  h,  with  one  observation  every  8  h  (each 
plant/dish is observed 21 times): the total image dataset 
contains  21.000  observations  of  a  plant  at  a  timestep. 
We  selected  a  representative  subset  of  36  Petri  dishes 
180  plants)  to  be  manually  annotated  along  the 
( Ntest
21  time  points  (3780  plant.timestep)  to  perform  valida-
tion tests. The expert identifies which plant can be con-
sidered an outlier during the annotation process. Most of 
the  time,  outliers  are  bacteria-contaminated  plants  that 

=

stopped  growing  or  died  during  the  time  course.  These 
plants are removed from the dataset and are not included 
in the validation dataset.

The  36  dishes  cover  the  genotypic  and  environmental 
variations.  The  first  18  Petri  dishes  are  used  as  a  train-
ing  set  to  train  the  model  and  fine-tune  the  pipeline 
parameters.  The  18  remaining  dishes  are  used  as  a  vali-
dation  set.  The  metrics  presented  in  the  results  section 
are  computed  on  this  validation  set,  by  comparing  the 
phenes  measured  on  the  estimated  architecture  with 
those  on  the  annotated  architecture.  Consequently,  the 
results presented hereafter are computed on a test set of 
18 × 5 × 21 = 1890 plant.timestep.

Phene measurements
The annotation process consists on editing 2D + t RSML 
until they fit perfectly with the image time-series. After-
wards,  these  RSML  can  be  processed  by  automatic 
routines to extract static and dynamic phenes. Then, pre-
dicted versus annotated RSML are compared to measure 
the  performance  of  the  pipeline  for  static  and  dynamic 
phenes predictions. More specifically, the length of a root 
at a given time t is obtained by summing the length of the 
individual segments constituting its root central line, and 
having an apparition time lower or equal to t.

Results
The  performance  of  the  pipeline  is  measured  using  sev-
eral metrics to estimate the geometrical and topological 
fidelity of the reconstruction.

Performance of static trait estimation

We  first  assess  the  performance  of  the  pipeline  on  the 
estimation of static traits by using global traits frequently 
used  in  the  literature:  total  predicted  number  of  organs 
and predicted cumulated length for primary and second-
order  roots.  Our  dataset  is  composed  of  complex  root 
architectures  with  numerous  organ  crossings.  We  com-
pute these traits at the last time point when the architec-
ture  reaches  its  maximum  complexity.  At  this  stage,  we 
evaluate the capabilities of our method to disentangle the 
numerous organs when processing complex root systems.
The three graphs in Fig. 7 illustrate the accuracy of the 
measurements,  especially  on  organ  length  estimation 
(Fig. 7A and B), with a correlation coefficient of 0.996 and 
0.923 for primary and lateral roots, respectively. Moreo-
ver, regression lines between predicted and ground-truth 
values have small intercepts and slope coefficients near 1 
(i.e.,  0.99  for  primaries  and 1.02  for  second-order  roots, 
see  Fig.  7A  and  B).  Our  method,  applied  on  a  complex 
dataset,  also  exhibits  state-of-the-art  performances  [35, 
36] on second-order root counting (Fig. 7C), with a cor-
relation  coefficient  of  0.818.  These  performances  make

due to developing bacterial strains. These non-plant ele-
ments were identified as roots and severely impacted the 
prediction of the pipeline.

Performance of dynamic traits estimation

The  pipeline  reconstructs  RSA  over  time,  allowing  to 
quantify  each  root’s  elongation  rate  and  its  evolution 
throughout the time series, providing access to dynamic 
traits.  In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  pipeline  perfor-
mance of dynamic traits quantification. We measured the 

total  additional  length  between  successive  time  points 
and  the  additional  length  corresponding  to  laterals.  We 
further investigate the source of errors by estimating the 
additional  length  of  laterals  within  three  classes:  roots 
attached  to  the  primary’s  upper  part,  middle  part,  and 
the bottom part (Fig. 8).

Figure  8A  represents  the  successive  observation  of 
a  root  system  overlaid  with  the  corresponding  recon-
structed  architecture.  Figure  8B  represents  the  2D + t 
reconstruction  of  a  unique  plant  from  data  automati-
cally obtained by the pipeline (left panel) or from expert 
analysis (right panel). Each horizontal dot-line represents 
a  lateral  root,  and  the  colour  of  each  dot  represents  the

elongation  rate  of  the  individual  root  between  two  suc-
cessive  time  points.  This  figure  visually  illustrates  the 
high accuracy of the analysis. Most organs are well esti-
mated  (green  arrow),  with  minor  differences  occurring 
when the track of a root is lost and prolonged artificially 
(pink arrow) or when a root is cut into two single organs 
(blue  arrow).  The  cumulated  lateral  root  growth  is  esti-
mated  between  two  successive  observations  with  high 
accuracy  ( R2
0.938 ).  Regression  lines  between  pre-
dicted and ground truth values have small intercepts and 
a  slope  coefficient  near  1  (i.e.,  1.05). The  most  challeng-
ing  part  to  estimate  is  the  deeper  compartment  of  lat-
eral roots, inserted in the deepest third of the petri dish. 
Roots growth from this compartment is estimated with a 
lower precision ( R2
0.769 , regression line slope = 0.95 ). 
These  roots  appear  at  the  end  of  the  time  course,  are 
smaller,  and  the  length  of  the  growing  units  is  closer  to 
the pixel size. Thus, their growing speed cannot be esti-
mated  accurately.  The  shallowest  third  of  the  petri  dish 
(Fig. 8C, in red) suffers from other misestimation biases 
induced  by  reconstruction  errors  when  the  leaves  fall 
into  the  root  system  ( R2
1.01 ).  Finally, 
roots in the middle zone do not suffer from these issues 
and  exhibit  a  high  accuracy  ( R2
1.00 ). 
To our knowledge, there are no phenotyping studies that 
validate  such  dynamic  traits,  while  these  measurements 
are of high interest to plant scientists.

Characterization of spatiotemporal phenotypes of root 
systems

In this section, we investigate the resulting spatiotempo-
ral  traits  extracted  to  unravel  the  studied  root  systems’ 
characteristics and assess our pipeline’s interest for GxE 
studies.

Topological and geometrical characterization of root system 
dynamics

Root  system  topology  is  widely  complex,  requiring  the 
information  to  be  simplified  before  being  analysed.  We 
derived  an  approach  used  for  meristem  organ  charac-
terization to produce a heatmap of the growing areas of 
the root systems. In order to evaluate this approach, we 
compared  the  reconstructed  graph  of  plants  grown  for 
six days on a control medium or subjected to a 150 mM 
sorbitol  osmotic  stress  (Fig.  9).  Terminal  RSA  analysis 
showed  that  osmotic  stress  reduces  primary  and  lateral

root length by 16 and 50%, respectively (Table 1). Kinetic 
reconstruction  clearly  showed  that  the  primary  root 
elongation  rate  was  reduced  under  osmotic  stress  since 
the  application  of  treatment  (green  line)  but  appeared 
more  variable  between  plants  than  under  control  con-
ditions  (dark  green  cone).  The  elongation  rate  of  lateral 
roots under osmotic stress was significantly reduced dur-
ing the first part of the experiment (p-value < 0.001 under 
Mann–Whitney test, see Additional file 1: Fig. S1), while 
this  statistical  distinction  progressively  vanishes  dur-
ing the last days of the experiment. In addition, osmotic 
stress  dramatically  delayed  the  development  of  older 
lateral  roots  in  the  0–15  mm  depth  interval  and  signifi-
cantly reduced the elongation rate of these roots (colder 
color on the heat map). On the contrary, lateral roots on 
the  30–50  mm  depth  interval  appeared  less  affected  by 
osmotic  stress  with  no  significant  delay  in  development 
and little difference in the elongation rate, suggesting dif-
ferent sensitivity or acclimation to osmotic stress. Finally, 
osmotic  stress  also  altered  the  topology  of  the  root  sys-
tem by reducing the distance from the last visible lateral 
root to the primary root tip (distance between the green 
line and the last visible line of the heat map). Altogether, 
these  results  open  promising  and  unexpected  perspec-
tives  to  analyse  the  dynamics  of  the  RSA  response  to 
osmotic stress.

Time‑lapse visualisation of the growing root system

In  addition  to  the  RSA  reconstruction  pipeline,  we  pro-
pose a method to visualise the growth of the root system. 
The  resulting  movie  shows  the  compilation  of  a  7-days 
growth in 1 min. It gathers all the pipeline achievements 
in a realistic rendering, giving a rapid and accurate over-
view  of  the  reconstruction  of  the  experiment  and  facili-
tating investigations by non-computer specialists.

The  movie  is  built  using  multiple  interpolation  tech-
niques. First, the reconstructed architecture is rasterized 
in  the  pixel  space.  The  apparition  time  of  each  pixel  of 
the  root  central  lines  is  determined  by  interpolating  the 
spatiotemporal  coordinates  of  the  surrounding  vertices 
in  the  model.  Each  pixel  of  the  segmented  RSA  is  then 
given the apparition time of the nearest pixel of the cor-
responding  central  line.  After  this  operation,  the  binary 
segmentation of the whole architecture is parameterized 
by  a  time  function,  giving  the  apparition  time  of  each 
pixel. This 2D + t segmentation is used to interpolate suc-
cessive masks of the growing RSA that are applied on the 
original  keyframes  {
1..Nt  of  the  registered  2D  time 
series.

to the image Ii to gather the background part. The assem-
bling is done by summing these two images.

When t is close to an observation time Ti (images near 
a  keyframe),  we  proceed  to  a  fading  by  computing  the 
same  operations  using  the  subsequent  keyframes  ( Ii
1 
and  Ii
2 ). Finally, the individual results are merged with 
fading factors that vary following a linear ramp to make 
these transitions unnoticeable.

After interpolating time-lapse images, we compute the 
position  and  speed  at  each  time  frame  from  the  recon-
structed  RSA.  They  are  overlaid  on  the  image  and  dis-
played  as  colored  tips  with  a  colormap  indicating  the 
elongation rate.

The  default  parameters  of  the  procedure  result  in  a 
movie  of  the  growing  RSA  generating  one  image  every 
15 min, from an initial time series composed of 21 time-
frames, one every 8 h.

Discussion
In  this  contribution,  we  proposed  a  novel  method  for 
robust  acquisition  of  root  system  architecture  with 
its  topology  and  development  with  HIRROS,  a  high-
throughput  root  phenotyping  platform.  Our  automatic 
pipeline  combines  spatial  and  temporal  information 
to  segment  structures  with  their  apparition  time  and  a 
topological  tracking  algorithm  to  reconstruct  the  whole 
architecture,  including  primary  and  second-order  roots. 
Our  pipeline  is  robust  to  root  crossing.  We  evaluated 
our  method  on  a  dataset  of  complex  root  systems  and 
assessed  performance  in  terms  of  geometric  and  topo-
logic  fidelity  of  the  reconstructed  2D + t  architectures. 
We show the ability of our method to capture spatio-tem-
poral  phenes  of  interest  to  the  community,  with  a  high 
level of guarantees.

We  developed  a  high-resolution  automated  imag-
ing  system  that  can  handle  up  to  200  Petri  dishes  (i.e., 
up  to  1000  plants)  and  image  the  plates  at  high  resolu-
tion (19 µm per pixel) and high contrast allowing excel-
lent root/background separation. Using a telecentric lens 
avoids  image  distortion  and  provides  a  huge  depth  of 
field combined with a micrometric controlled plate trans-
lation. HIRROS combines the high-resolution imaging as 
proposed  by  Gaggion  [10]  and  Ohlsson  [27],  with  high-
throughput [25], offering a unique opportunity to explore 
the GxE root adaptive responses to a wide range of abi-
otic stresses by introducing hydro mineral modifications 
of the culture medium affecting root system development 
while keeping the optical characteristics of the medium.

Petri  dishes  that  contain  transparent  agar  gelified 
medium  are  commonly  used  for  Arabidopsis  thaliana 
and  model  plants  RSA  analysis.  However,  they  imply 
several  constraints  like  root  crossing,  secondary  roots 
juxtapositions,  and  shoots’  movement  due  to  2D  space 
limitation. These  physiological  and  technical  constraints 
restrict RSA analysis to static or global dynamic parame-
ters [10]. In order to access the dynamic responses of the 
individual roots, we developed a dedicated image analysis 
pipeline.

Our  proposition  differs  from  most  state-of-the-art 
solutions,  where  segmentation  is  performed  separately 
on  successive  2D  images,  which  involves  a  subsequent 
step  to  match  the  successive  segmentations  or  RSA 
reconstructions  [23,  36].  One  solution  is  to  use  a  well-
trained  neural  network  to  perform  root  segmentation 
successfully in each 2D image using the information from 
the  previous  images  [36].  However,  training  this  type  of 
network  requires  a  large  training  set  of  manually  anno-
tated  images  and  a  tedious  task  of  reannotation  in  case 
of  transfer  learning.  We  propose  a  novel  method  incor-
porating  a  registration  step  to  achieve  accurate  super-
position  of  successive  observed  images  and  avoid  tree 

matching  problems.  The  registration  step  produces  a 
2D + t stack of aligned images, which enables us to pro-
pose  a  pixel-wise  root  detector  that  performs  root  seg-
mentation  and  determination  of  root  pixel  apparition 
time  in  one  go.  Our  pipeline  combines  spatial  and  tem-
poral  information,  facilitating  the  segmentation  step  to 
such an extent that our mean-shift detector achieves per-
formance comparable to deep neural networks [23, 36].

However,  our  method  has  shown  some  limitations. 
When  unwanted  structures  appear  in  the  image  field, 
they  can  be  mistaken  for  growing  roots,  resulting  in 
errors  that  must  be  detected  and  post-processed  dur-
ing  the  graph  construction  step.  This  point  complicates 
the  algorithm,  which  must  adapt  to  specific  circum-
stances  by  deploying  additional  post-processing  opera-
tions.  The  pipeline  could  benefit  from  a  pre-processing 
step integrating a neural network in charge of predicting 
the  pixel-wise  probability  of  the  presence  of  a  root  and 
removing  unwanted  structures  from  the  input  of  the 
mean-shift detector. That way, we could take the best of 
the two worlds and probably achieve even better perfor-
mances, although this prospect implies that our pipeline 

Fernandez et al. Plant Methods          (2022) 18:127 

Page 17 of 19

must be trainable. As such, our pipeline does not require 
any tedious annotation and training tasks.

Nevertheless,  while  our  pipeline  is  fully  automatic, 
some parameters need to be calibrated for a new experi-
mental  configuration:  mean  intensity  of  roots,  mean 
intensity of background, and max acceptable root speed. 
In  a  trainable  version  of  the  pipeline,  these  parameters 
could be derived automatically from a dataset containing 
some annotated examples. By integrating these improve-
ments,  our  pipeline  could  be  transferable  to  other 
datasets.

Analysis  of  root  system  growth  in  Petri  dishes  is  a 
unique tool for high-throughput phenotyping. However, 
observing root systems in 2D involves dealing with mul-
tiple root crossovers as root system complexity increases. 
These situations are difficult to disentangle and can hin-
der  the  tracking  of  individual  roots.  Many  algorithms 
have  been  proposed  to  address  this  challenge.  Most  of 
them are greedy algorithms, processing root after root or 
time after time [16, 23, 29, 36] without a global view. In 
this work, we design a global tracking algorithm based on 
the region adjacency graph extracted from the segmenta-
tion  of  individual  root  segments.  We  evaluated  the  suc-
cess  of  this  algorithm  in  challenging  cases  when  laterals 
hide  below  primaries  or  multiple  laterals  (N = 3,  4,  5+) 
intersect in a small space.

The formal framework of our algorithm relies on strong 
assumptions:  there  is  no  third-order  ramification,  and 
through time all the growing roots pixels are included in 
the  final  image.  Our  results  show  that  some  specimens 
do  not  meet  these  assumptions,  which  induces  recon-
struction  errors,  such  as  when  plants  are  infected  with 
bacterial  strains.  Moreover,  our  algorithm  is  designed 
to  accurately  track  one  primary  root  per  plant  and  its 
second-order  roots.  It  does  not  include  the  possibility 
of multiple primary roots or third-order organs. Further 
work will focus on adjusting the assumptions to deal with 
the  emergence  of  third-order  organs  and  to  work  with 
other species with different root system architecture pat-
terns. To that end, the algorithm will be adapted to other 
assumptions regarding maximum order of ramifications, 
and  the  possibility  to  consider  multiple  root  types  such 
as  seminal  roots. This  will  allow  to  fit  this  pipeline  with 
other architectures.

Similarly, we plan to test the pipeline on other imaging 
systems,  such  as  paper  pouches,  rhizotubes  [13],  or  rhi-
zotrons. If the parameterization of the pipeline should be 
relatively  straightforward  for  paper  pouches  and  rhizo-
tubes that have an homogeneous background, analysis of 
rhizotron  derived  images  would  require  adjusting  many 
parameters, especially the relative brightness of the root 
and the background.

Finally,  future  experiments  will  include  larger  time 
series  with  more  developed  root  systems.  The  image 
space  cluttering  increases  when  the  root  system  grows. 
The  additional  complexity  between  successive  timesteps 
increases, including more root crossings and more failure 
opportunities  for  our  pipeline.  Thus  we  plan  to  investi-
gate larger image series in order to identify the limits of 
our pipeline in terms of image space cluttering.

Performances of the method have been evaluated using 
standard  metrics  on  a  complex  architecture  dataset. 
Interestingly, the relative error of the total lateral length 
does  not  seem  to  increase  with  the  development  of  the 
root  system.  This  point  could  be  crucial  to  study  more 
complex architectures. In addition, we validated the pipe-
line’s ability to estimate organs’ growth rate. By providing 
such  guarantees,  we  open  the  possibility  of  using  these 
dynamic phenes in GxE studies. We illustrated this point 
by comparing plant development under various levels of 
osmotic stresses, highlighting differences in primary and 
lateral growth patterns. Finally, we developed a visualisa-
tion method to construct a simulated time-lapse growth 
movie.  This  method  opens  up  the  possibility  of  gener-
ating  a  large  amount  of  realistic  synthetic  data  with  a 
parameterizable  timestep  and  voxel  size,  leading  to  the 
design of a trainable model.

Conclusion
The  presented  method  provides  a  unique  solution  for 
high-throughput  phenotyping  of  root  system  architec-
ture. It is robust to root crossing, which is the main dif-
ficulty for accurate tracking of the individual organs from 
2D  image  time-series.  The  reconstructed  architecture  is 
provided in RSML format, which integrates the topology 
and geometry of the root system, parameterized with the 
appearance time of the root segments.

Further work will focus on validating this pipeline with 
a larger panel of GxE variations and longer times series, 
adapting  the  hypothesis  used  for  the  topological  track-
ing,  and  making  the  pipeline  trainable  to  transfer  it  to 
different  species  or  mounting  configurations  (box  size, 
rhizotron).  The  resulting  architectures  will  be  used  as 
topological  and  geometrical  models  to  feed  functional 
and  structural  root  models  and  further  understand  root 
system development.
