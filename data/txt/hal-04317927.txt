Abstract— A robot can affect its social environment beyond
the person who is interacting with it. Within this context, we
believe it is important to explore Human-Robot Interactions
(HRI) in complex social settings. To this end we examine the
effect of different robot shapes in a multi-person context during
dance routines, to understand how the design of the robot
enhances the artistic process and through which factors human
preferences are being shaped within a novel third party setting
human-robot-human interaction (HRHI).

I. INTRODUCTION

Questioning how knowledge gained through art practices
“can relate to other forms of knowledge regarded by the
public as more or less authoritative or trustworthy” [1], art
is seen as a perfect frame for distributed knowledge.

Current research suggesting that people’s behaviors to-
wards robots are influenced by the observation of third-
party encounters between robots and other people [2], offers
important
insights. To the extent of our knowledge, we
are the first to investigate third-party (i.e. robot - robot -
human) interactions [3] within a dance imitation setting.
Such interactions will become more and more common with
the rise of the robot [4], [5], [6], [7]. In parallel, nonverbal
behaviours [8], [9] prove their efficiency in collaborative
processes between humans and robots. According to [10],
a robot can affect its social environment beyond the person
who is interacting with it. Within this context, we believe
it is important to explore Human-Robot Interactions (HRI)
in complex social settings. Our initial study was based on
a collective HRI done with virtual avatars of robots during
a dance workshop. The next step of our research, allows
us to tackle new interaction possibilities and verify a new
hypothesis about the human-robot social dynamics: from the
perspective of another human interacting with a human-
robot dyad, our hypothesis is the embodiment type influences
how the robot is being perceived and its impact on the
creative environment.Through our approach, we examine the
effect of different robot shapes in a multi-person context
during dance routines, to understand how the design of the
robot enhances the artistic process and through which factors
human preferences are being shaped within a third party
setting human-robot-human.

In this paper, motivated by the flourishing perspective of
staging robots in art performances, we introduce a novel
third-party human-robot-human interaction (HRHI) setting
as defined in [3]. Traditionally third-party interactions are
notably less studied than their two-party counterparts (see for
instance mediation studies with respect to negotiation studies
etc). We restrict ourselves to the setting of collaborative
dance routines involving upper body movements between
a professional dancer, a robot, and a human. Through this
setting, we are interested in the creative potential of such
interaction partners that we propose to measure by the im-
provising capacity of the human spectator. As noted by [11],
creativity in works of art involves skill defined as a certain
“plasticity of the control”, i.e., being able to see beyond the
specific problem with which one is dealing and having a
real understanding of the methods and procedures of the
discipline and the principles that lay behind them.

We propose to analyze the improvisation capacity induced
by the third-party creative state from the following key
points: substitutability [12], synchrony [13], [14], [15] and
kinaesthetic awareness [16], [17] of the participants:

• In dance, remembering a phrase or a gesture involves a
process of assimilation known as marking, where each dancer
reproduces the movement material by activating different
body parts. The observations of [12] propose the marking
technique as a scaffold to mentally project a more detailed
structure than one could otherwise be held in mind. Similar
to an interactive strategy augmenting cognition, dancers mark
with their bodies, dance sequences to remember and transmit
them. One of the proprieties of the marking is substitutability,
describing how a movement in one body part can represent
the movement in another. Following Kirsh’s observations
that “hand movements and head tilts regularly stand for the
motion of different body parts”, we propose a “dance with
the hands” experiment translated by robots, that encodes
different body parts in the human partners. In robotics this
can have equivalent implications with “the correspondence
problem” as defined in [14].

• Synchrony refers to simultaneous actions in our study,
playing an important role in collaborative practices [18]. As
defined in [19], this process corresponds to “the dynamic and
reciprocal adaptation of the temporal structure of behaviors
between interactive partners”. Moreover, synchrony influ-
ences the interaction quality to a greater extent than imitation
because “unlike mirroring or mimicry, it is dynamic in [...]
the timing, rather than the nature of the behaviors [19].”

• Alternatively, the kineasthetic awareness is a very im-
portant part of human physical education, involving inner

physical sensations, among which the sense of balance and
muscle tension. Seen as an ability to learn new things by
understanding and controlling the position and movement
of ones’ body, it is a key factor in dance improvisation.
According to [20] this type of awareness is related to embod-
iment [21] in human performers. Further on [16] introduces
the concept of kinaesthetic empathy, “which explores the
affective potential of movement and, with it, our innate
capacity to kinaesthetically perceive other bodies.” To tackle
this hypothesis, the authors set up a study involving the
BodyWeather dance training technique developed by chore-
ographer and dancer Tess de Quincey. This technique’s aim
is to cultivate body’s sensitivity and connectedness with its
environment, while generating original movement material.
In a similar approach, we focus on dance improvisation
mixed with spontaneous gestures to determine how partic-
ipants with little experience in dancing are relying on the
robot to improvise.

Transposing these observations to human-robot interac-
tions, allows us to determine the impact of robtos on an
overall artistic process and analyze how the embodiment type
influences the spontaneous responses in humans.

II. THE HRHI EXPERIMENT

A. Preliminary experiment

In the first preliminary experiment, we recruited 25 French
participants (24 females and 1 male) from a dance class
at Lycee La Mercy in Montpellier. The experiment took
place in November 2022. The mean age of the participants
was 16.44 (SD=0.58, MD=16). The participants had a group
experience of HRI, during a collective dance training session.
We prepared three video sequences of one minute each
where a series of gestures was executed, following the
same order. The 25 participating students were instructed
to imitate and then improvise with the virtual versions
of an industrial (Franka) and a humanoid robot (HRP-4),
see Figure 1. We asked them to collectively imitate each
sequence in the following order: human, industrial robot and
a humanoid robot. Once this imitation process occurred, we
switched off the projection and asked the participants to
collectively improvise using the gestures learnt during the
video trials. The improvisation lasted for about 15 minutes
and at their demand, we used recorded music to enhance
expressive states. Videos of this experiment are available on-
line (https://vimeo.com/779347404 and https:
//vimeo.com/779363288). At the end of this process,

Still from the HRP-4 experiments. Imitation phase above and

we asked the participants to fill in a form with 23 questions.
The feedback after the collective improvisation was that
learning by imitation facilitates the emergence of a creative
interaction type, improving the quality of movement.

Our goal was to understand how digital anthropomorphism
triggers creativity and the experiment provided useful in-
sights giving us the opportunity to tackle this concept in
a broader context; but, more importantly, it put the basis
for investigating the innovative HRHI setting introduced in
this paper and described in the next section. Among our
observations, we noted that the place the robot has within
the experiment depends on the familiarity with the subject.

B. Participant recruitment

For investigating HRHI, we have recruited 21 French
participants (7 females and 14 males) from Universit´e de
Montpellier. The experiment took place in March 2023 at the
Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics and Microelec-
tronics of Montpellier. The mean age of the participants was
24.9 (SD=3.11, MD=24). The study was conducted under
the ethical approval of the University of Montpellier.

C. Methodology

Each of our participants had to attend two sessions, one
with the Franka robot and one with the HRP-4 robot (in this
order). Those two sessions were split into an imitation phase
(phase 1) and an improvisation phase (phase 2).

The third-party interactions used a minute-long movement
sequence for each of the robots. We first programmed the
humanoid robot, then adapted the sequence to the physical
limitation (i.e., the number of degrees of freedom and joint
order) of the industrial arm, having an identical time grid
(i.e., a pause — freeze of motion — occurred at the same
moment and lasted for about 5 seconds). The sequence order
was identical for each interaction during the imitation phase,
while the order of gestures was performed randomly during
the improvisation phase. At the end of each session (after
the two phases), the participants had to answer 29 questions,
referred to as Qi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 29. The list of questions and

TABLE I
SUMMARY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE STATISTICS

some statistics about their answers are detailed in Table I.
Please note that Q28 and Q29 are open questions with free-
text answers; in Q18, the participant had to choose between
“did not respect the instruction to improvise”, “alternatively
improvised a few times with the robot and a few times with
the human”, “completely improvised by myself not giving
attention to either human or robot”, “imitated the human
who was improving with the robot”, “felt both improvising
with the human and the robot at the same time”, “improvised
only with the robot”, and “improvised only with the human”;
in Q6/Q7, the participants had to choose between “No” (1),
“Maybe” (2), and “Yes” (3). In all the other questions, the
participants had to answer using a 5-point Likert scale, from
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Questions Q2-4, Q10-11, Q13, and Q15-17 (light grey)
analyze the imitation context through synchrony and substi-
tutability, whereas Q5-7, Q18-20, and Q23 (dark grey) focus
on kinaesthetic awareness during the improvisational part.

Working with real robots instead of their digital twins [22],

[23] is motivated by the fact that dancing sequences appear-
ing smooth in simulations are altered by live noise, hazardous
physical contingencies, and subject to mechanical constraints
when enacted through robot bodies. As [21] states, “such
unpredictability is related to a robot’s material embodiment,
and part of their idiosyncratic charm as performers”. Addi-
tionally, the professional dancer used a combination of inten-
tional, aesthetic gestures and reflexive and everyday gestures
(like yawning) during the improvisation phase, adapting its
behaviour to each participant. When the dance improvisation
was less comfortable, she engaged in direct contact with the
participant, changing place accordingly or performing fewer
movements. When the participants expressed agency and
autonomy during the improvisation, she deliberately imitated
the participant, then performed a series of expressive motions
to see if the participant continues the process further. These
differences are addressed in Q8 and Q9 (green).

As the humanoid robot has gestures and movements that
are easily recognized as everyday gestures by the partici-

pants, we added an extra movement type to the sequence,
having the robot shake some body parts during the se-
quence. This movement type helped the participant distin-
guish intentional from unintentional (or reflex movements)
in the humanoid. It also produced occasionally a loud noise.
Alternatively, the industrial robot performed the sequence
without symmetrical body parts and the equivalent of shaking
expressed through jerk during some joint rotations. Our
choice to develop an interaction involving only upper-body
dance routines is influenced by the fact that working with
constraints enlarges expression possibilities in humans and
reduces the risks of robot malfunctioning. As the indus-
trial arm is set on a fixed base, it seemed logical to get
the humanoid robot immobile, on a chair. A second chair
was available during the humanoid robot experiments, and
participants were instructed to choose between using it or
not at the beginning of each session. Depending on the
choice of each participant, the dancer chose accordingly. As
a result, the setting of each experience was different, having
the participant and the humanoid sitting, the dancer and the
humanoid sitting, or both humans standing and the humanoid
sitting. The affordance characteristic [24] involving a chair
requires adopting a reflexive, static position while the human
has to compensate with the hands to generate expressive
movements. The aspects of comfort and constraints were
addressed in the Q10, Q20 and Q24 questions.

The rest of the questions are oriented towards the com-
prehension of creativity involving the three key points men-
tioned in Section I alongside subjective input expressed
through questions oriented towards emotions.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Considering creativity is a combination of skill and in-
tention [25], [26], [11], [27], our methodology identifies
the factors that differentiated a result from either non-
creative or creative. Given these premises, we proposed
a model of HRHI based on two phases (dance imitation
and dance improvisation) to analyze the human expecta-
tions within. We analyzed through our questionnaire the
kinaesthetic awareness, the substitutability as well as the
synchrony potential of two robots operating in an identical
laboratory setting. Although the motion algorithms were
identical, the robots’ moves elicited different reactions in
the participants. Their feedback might be related to their
familiarity with robots (i.e., participants less accustomed to
robots were more enthusiastic about their creative potential
in dance). We summarize our results and identify some of
the challenges as follows. A detailed version of the data
is available here: https://osf.io/rkqwt/?view_
only=ac3cb3ca6e4b4da09052ef5ffeb4d1c2.

A. Numerical analysis of results

During the imitation phase, 95.3% of the participants
easily imitated the dance sequence for the humanoid robot,
compared to 61.9% for the industrial arm. Moreover, 71.5%
of the participants in the interaction with the humanoid robot
and 61.9% for the industrial arm considered it not suitable

to use improvisation movements during this phase. These
participants were engaged in what Dourish calls “absorbed
coping” [21], or a full engagement in the interaction, with
47.6% of participants for the humanoid and 33.3% partic-
ipants for the industrial arm, not imitating the professional
dancer at all. A similar distribution of answers regarding
comfort during the imitation: with 85.7% participants feeling
comfortable while imitating the humanoid robot and 38.1%
the dancer, compared to 66.7% for the robot and 42.85%
for the dancer - for the industrial arm robot. This might be
correlated with the fact that for the humanoid robot, 71.4%
of the participants decided to sit on the chair during either
the improvisation or the imitation phase. The feeling of being
inspired by the human dancer’s movements compared to the
robot follows the same trend, with 42.8% of participants
agreeing this is the case for the humanoid robot, compared to
38.9% for the industrial one. Overall, the participants found
it more interesting to follow the movements of the robot,
instead of the dancer- with 66.7% for both the industrial and
the humanoid robots. Only a small minority- 19% for the
industrial and 14.3% for the humanoid identified emotions
in the robot’s dance, compared to the human’s - 61.9% for the
industrial session and 57.1% for the humanoid one. Accord-
ing to [28] in bodily emotional expression modes, humans
can recognize on average about 50% of a robot’s emotions
correctly. The lower score in our study can be explained
by the fact that the robots were not reactive. This obser-
vation emphasizes our intuition that participants engaged in
dance (either imitating or improvising) were less likely to
contemplate the performative act and ascribe emotions to
either human or robot. On another note, during the imitation
phase, 66.7% of the participants felt in synchrony with the
humanoid robot compared to 57.1% for the industrial robot.
Comparing these results to the same question regarding the
improvisation phase, we note a difference, as only 14.3%
for the industrial robot and 23.8% for the humanoid robot
responded positively. This finding proves that synchrony is
less established through dance improvisation, regardless of
the robot type or the dancer.

Another interesting fact to mention is that while impro-
vising, the participants did not feel the need to engage in
physical contact with the robot (66.7% for the industrial
arm and 90.5% with the humanoid robot) with a slight
indecision percentage for the industrial arm (19%), compared
to (9.5%) for the humanoid robot. Alternatively, 14.3% of
the participants in the experiment with the industrial arm
responded affirmatively to this question, whereas none for the
humanoid robot. This interest in physical contact, reinforcing
the kinaesthetic awareness during the improvisation phase,
can facilitate a dance creative state in HRHI dance.

(80.95% for the industrial robot and 90.4% for the humanoid)

shape. However, 42.85% of the participants for the industrial

B. Limitations and future work

One shortcoming of our experiment is the order in which
the trials occurred. Most of the participants started with the
industrial arm experiment and then in the humanoid one. Our
intention would have been to have the participants interact in
random order with the two robots, but for logistic reasons, it
was not possible. The imitation phase and its incidence in the
participants regarding the humanoid robot might be explained
by the fact that seeing the context of the experiments before,
got
the participants more accustomed to the constraints.
Alternatively, these participants were less engaged in the
need for a physical contact with the robot, challenging the
idea of creativity emerging from collaborative practices like
dance contact. Overall, the number of participants might also
be a limitation for our analysis, as the data set is small
compared to other studies.

As for our key factors, if substitutability and synchrony are
verifiable (i.e through video analysis or direct observation),
working with kinaesthetic awareness has a dual nature and is
more difficult to measure. According to [17]: “sensorimotor
processes can be characterized as both opaque and transpar-
ent. The apparent contradiction is resolved when considering
that in both cases there is an issue of not seeing: opacity
prevents us from seeing what we try to see, transparency
is not seeing that through which we see.” To understand
its incidence in the improvisation process we rely on our
participants’ feedback but hope that for our future studies,
some sensor measurements could complement our analysis.
Furthermore getting both robots to react
to participant’s
movements (i.e., similarly to the human dancer) could also
positively affect the overall feedback regarding creativity.

IV. CONCLUSION

Unlike other art forms, dance co-exists with traditions
involving common, everyday gestures that later inspire aes-
thetic processes. Throughout its history, post-modern dance
has renewed its expression by mixing these everyday gestures
with aesthetical ones on stage, through a process of imita-
tion and improvisation. Imitation in human-robot interactive
dance has been long researched in the literature [29], [30],
[31], especially in an embodiment setting [32], [33], [34].
While improvisation was mostly used to improve robots’ re-
activity and social acceptance [21], [35], [36], [37] artists get
robots to improvise on stage whether it is for dancing [38],
[21], [16] or playing music [39]. It is important to specify
that in our current study, rather than improvising, the robots
are emulating improvisation according to pre-programmed
algorithms. Originally a tool for composition, HRI dance
improvisation is becoming a live performance technique
enhancing creativity in the performers. Inspired by the work
of [21], we used improvisation as a bottom-up approach
for analyzing embodied interaction in dance. As [40] states,
robot design changes rapidly while models become obsolete
once companies stop developing them further. Consequently,
the robotic community has difficulties in sharing common
ground on what the term “robot” currently implies, includ-
ing a large spectrum of shapes like “android, humanoid,

unintentional movements (type yawning and shaking) among
the standard, aesthetic movements- we wanted to see if the
participants made the distinction between them during the
third-party interaction. In both cases, 52.4% for the industrial
arm and 47.6% for the humanoid one, participants managed
to identify them. For the robots,
these movements were
simulated during the improvisation phase sessions, where
each sequence was performed in a random order compared to
the imitation phase. For the humanoid robot, a state inspired
by human shaking was added. Only 19% of the participants
for the industrial arm identified these movements, compared
to 85.7% for the humanoid robot. We explain this difference
by the fact that the shaking movement was relatively dif-
ferent from the rest of the movements of the sequence, and
also analogical to states of neurological dysfunctions in the
human body. The occasional jerk from the industrial robot
was less attributed to a human-like characteristic.

When asked whom they have improvised with during
the second session, the answers had a similar distribution
for both robots. For the humanoid robot, 33.3% of the
participants improvised alternatively with both human and
robot, 28.6% only with the robot, 23.8% improvised with
both at the same time, while 9.5% completely improvised
by themselves and 4.8% did not respect the instruction to
improvise. For the industrial arm, 28.6% of the participants
improvised with both human and robot at the same time, an-
other 28.57% improvised only with the robot, 23.8% impro-
vised alternatively with both human and robot, while 9.5%
completely improvised by themselves and others 9.5% did
not respect the instruction to improvise. An explanation of
these dynamics is illustrated in Fig. 3. We note that none of
our participants responded they improvised with or imitated
the dancer exclusively, regardless of the robot shape, proving
the focus in an HRHI remains on the robot.

mechanoid, machine-like, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic”.
Within such categories, understanding the interaction possi-
bilities between humans and robots is a complex challenge,
at the core of several disciplines involving robotics, neuro-
science, psychology, ethology, philosophy of mind, and pos-
sibly arts. Recycling current practices, technologies, and pro-
tocols is less investigated than innovative models, leading to
an oversimplified view of HRI. Consequently, we expanded
the original settings of HRI to a third-party interaction model,
in order to develop further emergent concepts related to arts
and creativity that could increase social acceptance of robots.
The authors in [41], [17], [21], cite the computer scientist
Paul Dourish for whom “embodiment
is not a property
of systems, technologies, or artefacts; it is a property of
interaction”. The type of embodied interaction we studied
aims at “the creation and sharing of meaning” as defined by
Dourish. In conclusion, the concept of embodiment is not
limited to the physical manifestation of people and objects,
being expanded to collaborative relationships between people
and things. Through our study, we highlighted the importance
of third party interactions in art experiments involving robots,
hoping these models would increase the quality of exchange
between them and humans in different social contexts.
