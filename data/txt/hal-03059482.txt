Introduction 

Organ development and meristem fate  is partly determined by endogenous signals moving 
within  plants.  These  signals  (e.g. hormones, sugar …) originate  from  organs  considered  as 
sources  (roots,  leaves,  seeds…)  and  act  on  meristems to trigger  developmental  processes 
such  as  transition  toward  flowering.  Functional  structural  plant  model  (FSPM)  are  of  major 
interest as they are based on an explicit description of plant architecture needed for simulating 
transports with in  plants.  Transport or  fluxes  have  been  modeled  in  FSPM  with  a  special 
consideration on carbon allocation (Génard et al., 2008). Approaches for simulating hormone 
fluxes  are  scarce,  adapted  to  plant  with  simple  architecture and  usually  associated  with  a 
comprehensive knowledge on the processes to be simulated (Prusinkiewicz et al., 2009); thus 
limiting  their  adaptability  in  various contexts.  In  this  study , we  present  a  generic  model  for 
simulating signal fluxes and their impact on meristem fates in complex 3D tree structure. We 
applied this model to the simulation of within tree variability of floral induction in the apple tree, 
as  a  first  case  of  study. P revious  experiments  (Belhassine  et  al., 2019)  showed  that  floral 
induction in meristems occurs less often in the presence of fruit whereas it is favoured by the 
presence of leaves. Furthermore, the influences of fruit and leaves on the floral induction of 
meristems depend on the distances of those organs within the tree structure. Fruit and leaves 
were thus assumed to be sources of inhibiting signals (possibly gibberellins from seeds) and 
activating  signals (possibly  FT  protein), respectively.  However, the distance  at  which  these 
signals move within the structure and the relative sensitivity of the meristems to these signals 
are highly difficult to estimate from experimental studies, only. 

Material and methods 

The model uses libraries from the OpenAlea platform (Pradal et al., 2008). The model runs on 
3D tree architectures coded in Multiscale Tree Graphs (MTG, Godin and Caraglio, 1999). It 
simulates transport  of  signals in  both  acropetal  and  basipetal  directions and a  decrease  in 
signal  quantity  with  the  distances  from  the  emitting  sources.  Making use  of  previous 
formalisms developed for carbon allocation models (Reyes et al., 2020), the decrease in signal 
quantity  depends  on  the  distance  to  the  emitting  source  and  an  attenuation  parameter  (r) 
modulating  the  effect  of  distances.  For  r values  close  to  0,  the  signal  is  equally  distributed 
among  organs  within  the  structure  whereas  it  is  transported  at  shorter distance s when  r  
increases. The  amount of  signal reaching  each meristem then  determines  its  probability  to 
switch  form  a  developmental  stage  to  another This  fate  was  determined  with  a  sigmoidal 
function  assuming  two  parameters,  a  transition  parameter  (t)  and  a  shape  parameter  (v). t 
represents the amount of signal at which the probability of the meristem to switch to another 
developmental stage is equal to 50% and v represents the uncertainty in SAM fate for a given 
amount of signal.  

The  model  was  used  for  simulating  within  tree  variability  in  floral  induction  in  apple 
tree. Fruit were considered as sources of inhibiting signal and leaves as sources of activating 
signal.  Both  signals were combined  to  determine  the  occurrence  of floral  induction  in  each

trees subjected to either leaf or fruit removal at different scales of plant organization (shoot, 
branch, tree) to modify the intensity of signals as well as the distances between the remaining 
leaves, fruit and meristems (Belhassine et al., 2019). 3D mock-ups built from digitizing data 
and  measured  floral  induction  in  the  different  parts  of  the  trees  were  confronted  to  model 
outputs for estimating the best combinations of parameter values. The model was validated 
on trees subjected both to leaf and fruit removal and to contrasted crop load conditions, testing 
two different functions to combine the impact of activating and inhibiting signals.  

Results and Discussion 

Simulations  performed  on  simple  hypothetical  structures  showed  model  consistency  to 
simulate  signal  effects  as  well  as  the  decrease  in  signal  amount  with  distances  and  its 
distribution in branching systems. Calibrations performed on apple trees for simulating within 
tree  variability  were  highly  relevant  (R²>0.9  and RMSE  <12%).  Validations  were  consistent 
when simulations  were compared to trees with contrasted crop load conditions but were of 
lower  quality  for  trees  subjected  to  both  leaf  and  fruit  removal.  This  is  probably  due  to 
difficulties  to  combine  the  effects  of  inhibiting  and  activating  signal.  Analysis  of  parameter 
values give some clues about the physiological processes involved as the modelling approach 
allowed us to quantify the distances at which activating and inhibiting signals were transported 
as well as the sensitivity of the meristems to these signals when considered separately.

and non-induced meristems.  

Conclusion 

The model uses MTG, a generic formalism adapted for representing all types of architectures, 
and simple assumptions that were compatible for simulating developmental switches such as 
floral induction in meristems in the apple tree case. It could be thus tested for exploring the 
consequences of tree architecture genetic variability on floral induction and fruiting behaviours. 
Experimental data are yet available and the model is currently used in this perspective.
