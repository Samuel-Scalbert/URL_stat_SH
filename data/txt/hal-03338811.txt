Abstract

Pl@ntnet is a citizen observatory that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to
help people identify plants with their smartphones (Joly 2014). Over the past few years,
Pl@ntNet has become one of the largest plant biodiversity observatories in the world with
several million contributors (Bonnet 2020b). Based on user demands, a set of tools and
services   following   the   FAIR   (Findable,   Accessible,   Interoperable,   Reusable)   principles
(Wilkinson 2016)  were   implemented   to   allow   the   development   of   e-floras.   After   a   short
description of the platform (see Joly (2015) and Joly (2016) for details), we present three
complementary services dedicated to the customization of e-floras.

The general workflow of Pl@ntNet can be divided into three main components. First, the
Pl@ntNet   mobile   Android  and   iOS  apps,   dedicated   to   plant   identification,   allow   both
anonymous and authenticated users to take a picture of a plant, and to send it to a server
for recognition at the species level. This recognition, which is performed by a convolutional
neural network (Affouard 2017), allows the user to get a list of candidate species, each
associated with a confidence score. The second component of Pl@ntNet's workflow is the
enrichment   of   the   database   to   improve   the   observation   quality   of   the   data   collected.
Because of the huge volume of data (over four million observations shared in 2020, Pl@nt
Net   statistics),   this   enrichment   cannot   be   done   solely   by   expert   botanists.   This   is   why

various   crowdsourcing   mechanisms   have   been   put   in   place   allowing   the   collaborative
curation of the data. The third part of the Pl@ntNet workflow is the exploitation of the
database, which is made available for the needs of stakeholders such as researchers. For
example, the recent sharing of Pl@ntNet data on GBIF's (Global Biodiversity Information
Facility) platform, through two complementary datasets, has increased the benefit to the
scientific community (examples are available here).

To support the development of customized e-floras, three complementary concepts have
been developed: micro-projects, groups, and monitoring work spaces, whose services are
detailed below:

(a) Micro-projects allow full adaptation of all the interfaces of the Pl@ntNet apps to a
species list of interest. This e-flora can be linked to a specific geographical area, which
allows   it   to   be   automatically   selected   according   to   the   user's   location.   When   several
specific   geographical   areas   overlap   for   a   given   geolocation,   the   smallest   one   is
automatically selected. This adaptation increases the accuracy of the identification, as the
number of potential species for a given identification request is reduced to the checklist of
the   micro-project   (e.g.,   Bonnet   (2020a)).   Up   to   now,   12   micro-projects   adapted   to
European, African or Asian contexts are running on the platform. A full description of this
service is provided in Bonnet (2020c). The API (Application Programming Interface) for the
identification service of each e-flora is available on My-Pl@ntNet.

(b) Groups allow any user to create a private or public space on the platform ( https://
identify.plantnet.org/groups),   to   permit   everyone   to   aggregate   a   part   or   all   of   their
observations in the group. A group is "observation-centered" as opposed to a micro-project,
which   is   species-centered.   If   the   group   is   public,   any   authenticated   user   can   join   and
contribute to it; if it is private, only users validated by the group's moderators can become
members. When a group is restricted to a specific geographical zone (such as a school,
city,   or   natural   area),   only   observations   found   in   that   area   are   displayed   in   the   group,
contrary the micro-project. As all the group's observations can be downloaded (as tabbed
or comma separated values) by any of the group's members, group features can be used
to conduct statistical analyses on the data in order to study plant plots, plant phenology or
user profiles. These groups are used by people who want to structure the activity of a
group of people interested in monitoring the biodiversity of a given area, a taxonomical
group, or a type of plant habitat. Over 260 groups have already been created by e.g.,
professional land managers, educators, and plant enthusiasts.

(c) Monitoring work spaces allows a given stakeholder to access all the observations and
identification   requests   of   a   given   species   list   in   a   particular   area.   Micro-projects   and
Groups only allow exploration of plant observations explicitly shared by the authenticated
users. However, Pl@ntNet's database contains hundreds of millions of plant identification
requests   submitted   by   anonymous   users.   Monitoring   work   spaces   was   set   up   to   allow
access by land managers to this rich and important material. These work spaces provide
the   maps,   the   list   of   plant   observations,   and   identification   requests   (with   a   very   high
confidence score on the species identification), for all the species of interest to a given
partner. For example, this service has been mobilized to follow the recent development of

an invasive species (i.e., Hakea sericea Schrad. & J.C. Wendl.) in and around a natural
reserve on the Mediterranean coast.

All   of   these   on-demand   e-floras   and   monitoring   services   accelerate   the   use   of   daily-
produced data, and inform land managers and scientists of the changes in the floristic
composition of monitoring areas.
