ABSTRACT
This paper highlights the challenges of representing uncertain
geospatial information in knowledge graphs. We propose to use
Real Estate advertisements since professionals use a lot of vernac-
ular and vague places in order to promote a house to their target
audience. Then, we suggest to model local place names using fuzzy
set theory. Finally, we discuss how to build a knowledge graph that
represents extracted geospatial objects and their uncertainty.

1 INTRODUCTION
Digital gazetteers are dictionaries, often organized into a graph,
that provide place names, their attributes and relations of millions
of entries, and are often developed by government agencies from
structured data. However, gazetteers do not contain all places be-
cause of their relative insignificance to a gazetteer covering a large
area (e.g., world gazetteer) or their vernacular nature (e.g., abbrevi-
ations, non-official names). Vernacular places refer to place names
with vague boundaries defined by regional culture (e.g., a "city
center", "the old downtown", "West of Nice"). On the other hand, a
myriad of unstructured (textual) data using natural language, such
as travel blogs, social media or Real Estate advertisements, quali-
tatively refer to locations, and could be used to enrich gazetteers.
Nevertheless, the geospatial knowledge extracted from textual data
is often uncertain and imprecise since vague and unofficial place
names are used. For example, Real Estate advertisements contain
a lot of vernacular places because professionals do not often give
the exact position of a house, and use unofficial place names and

vague spatial expression to locate it. Also, location is one of the
most valuable factors of purchasing and, Real Estate agents exag-
gerate boundary of place names that are popular and well reputed
to promote a house to their target audience [? ].

Although geospatial knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a good way
of modeling and representing the knowledge extracted from texts
and reason over it [? ? ? ? ], most existing geospatial KGs represent
geospatial objects with sharp and established boundaries (e.g., poly-
gons, points, lines, etc.). On the other hand, fuzzy set theory, that
uses membership functions to define the degree to which each point
in the space belongs to a fuzzy location, could deal with geospatial
objects with imprecise boundaries. In this paper, we suggest to
represent uncertain geospatial objects extracted from Real Estate
advertisements, using fuzzy set theory, in a geospatial KG. We first
present fuzzy sets to model uncertain boundaries of vernacular
place names. Then, we outline the main concepts to represent the
uncertain information in a geospatial KG.

2 FUZZY GEOSPATIAL OBJECTS
In fuzzy sets theory, elements of a set have degrees of member-
ship, generally in the interval [0,1]. A major advantage of fuzzy
set theory is that it returns an approximation of the location in-
stead of a sharp area that should be the location. A fuzzy set 𝐴 is
characterized by its membership function 𝜇𝐴 , which describes the
degree of membership of a point in the space to a fuzzy geographic
set. Another advantage is that we can retrieve crisp sets from the
membership function, such as core, support and 𝛼-cuts, defined as:

=

(cid:8)𝑥 ∈ 𝐴; 𝜇𝐴 (𝑥) = 1(cid:9),
(cid:8)𝑥 ∈ 𝐴; 𝜇𝐴 (𝑥) > 0(cid:9),
(cid:8)𝑥 ∈ 𝐴; 𝜇 ˜𝐴 (𝑥) ≥ 𝛼 (cid:9),
(cid:8)𝑥 ∈ 𝐴; 𝜇 ˜𝐴 (𝑥) > 𝛼 (cid:9).
˜𝐴𝛼 , is a crisp set where all the points belonging to the

set have a degree of membership greater than or equal to 𝛼. While, a strong
𝛼-cut of 𝐴,
𝛼 , is a crisp set where all the points belonging to the set have
a degree of membership greater than 𝛼 The support is a particular strong
𝛼-cut where 𝛼 = 0. The core is a crisp set where all the points have a degree
of membership equal to 1. A fuzzy set may have an empty core.

In our application on Real Estate advertisements, we extract a large num-
ber of vernacular place names. Thus, we estimate local place names applying
the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) algorithm to geotagged housing adver-
tisements. KDE is a non-parametric estimation method that infers the shape
of a variable from a sample, and gives a probability (density) for each point
of the support. In our study, we chose Gaussian kernels to approximate
the boundary of geospatial object. We then transform Gaussian kernels
into a fuzzy set by taking the normalize density function as a membership
function. Although this method is very suitable for vernacular places, it
requires a great amount of data to get a reliable estimated footprint.

3 KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION OF
UNCERTAIN AND VAGUE PLACES

In this section, we discuss the representation of geospatial information ex-
tracted from Real Estate advertisements, in the form of an RDF knowledge
graph. The main challenge is to represent uncertain information and store
spatial objects as fuzzy sets. We propose to add properties to GeoSPARQL
vocabulary and to use RDF-star to express uncertainty. GeoSPARQL is a
standard to represent and query geospatial linked data. Comparing to other
geographic vocabularies1 GeoSPARQL offers a flexible way to represent ex-
tracted knowledge thanks to its small ontology. Also, many spatial relations
have been defined and implemented that facilitate geospatial applications.
Regarding RDF-Star, it has been introduced to overcome the limitations of
previous mechanisms such as RDF reification or singleton properties. It
also provides a concise syntax extension to easily annotate RDF statements
themselves. The key concepts and relations are described below.

Spatial Object. A spatial object is anything being or having a shape or
position according to GeoSPARQL. In our study, we have to represent houses,
place names, place types and footprints as geo:SpatialObject. A place type
is a subclass of geo:Feature while a place name (or a house) is an instance
of geo:Feature. Sometimes, Real Estate professionals refer to a place only
with its place type (e.g., "near the train station"). So, we represent the place
name as a blank node. Finally, we link a place to its location through the
geo:hasGeometry property.

Uncertainty. Uncertainty arises when imperfect or unknown information
is observed. In our situation, we have uncertainty at different levels of
information. First, we automatically extract place names and place types
that are not always official (e.g., "La Banane" in Cannes, France). Also, we
estimate a footprint using Kernel Density Estimation. However, this method
is not very precise and depends on the amount and reliability of data. We
propose to model and add a confidence value to the relations using RDF-Star.

Vague Spatial Footprint. A spatial footprint is a geometrical representa-
tion of a spatial object. A spatial footprint is vague if its boundary is not
crisp. In our work, we represent a spatial footprint as a fuzzy set, while
the class geo:Geometry provides only geometries with sharp boundaries
(e.g., Polygon, Point, Line). Furthermore, GeoSPARQL defines spatial re-
lations (e.g., geo:sfContains, geo:sfOverlaps) between spatial objects that
facilitate geospatial applications. In [? ], the authors extend spatial relations
to vague objects, especially using the core, support and 𝛼-cut of a fuzzy set.
Also, GeoSPARQL makes it possible to add several geometries to the same
place. So, we propose to define ex:AlphaCut and ex:StrongAlphaCut as sub-
classes of geo:Geometry and three properties ex:hasCore, and ex:hasSupport,
ex:hasAlpha. Then, we could add the core, support and several 𝛼-cuts to a
place to represent as reliable as possible its fuzzy boundary.

4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we devised a formal representation of uncertain and imprecise
geospatial objects extracted from Real Estate advertisements in a knowledge
graph. This paper constitutes an initial step in the knowledge representation
of vague geospatial information, and we plan to continue this work by
implementing it on a large dataset.
