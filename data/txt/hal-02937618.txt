INTRODUCTION

3. Here we present two Pl@ntNet citizen science initiatives used by conservation

practitioners in Europe (France) and Africa (Kenya). We discuss various perspectives,

including benefits and limitations. Based on the experiences of field managers, we

formulate several recommendations for future initiatives. The recommendations are

aimed at a diverse group of conservation managers and citizen science practitioners.

F I G U R E 1 Data acquisition and management workflow implemented in the two analysed case studies. (a) In the Ramières Reserve, pioneer
citizen scientists (i.e. Citizen scientist(A)) have provided a large volume of visual data to allow accurate automatic identification by reserve
managers and local citizen scientists (i.e. Citizen scientist(B)), which yields reliable observation data. In this case, pioneer citizen scientists did not
use Pl@ntNet restricted to a reference local plant list, but designed for all French flora. The data provided have, however, made it possible to
improve the identification of the species present in the reserve. The observations produced in the Ramières Reserve are shared with the external
scientific advisor for validation. (b) For the Lewa Conservatory, the Lewa House and the Lewa Conservancy have contextualized a Pl@ntNet
platform restricted to a reference species list and have produced a large amount of observations (more than 3,500 observations) to initiate the
automatic identification service on Lewa flora. This context-specific platform is used by the Lewa managers, its partners and visitors (Citizen

initial contributions from citizens, for more than 460 species with the
