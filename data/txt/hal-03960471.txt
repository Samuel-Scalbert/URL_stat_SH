Although it was initially an “Information management proposal” [1] the Web really is a
successful « application integration platform » [2]. More importantly, it is both. It is a
self-documenting hypermedia system for application and information integration, and that
makes the Web very special. Just like it is important to propose a Web of linked data
and distributed RDF knowledge graphs as an alternative to data silos [3], the Web must
also support an alternative to intelligence silos and thrive to host a wealth of distributed
artificial and natural intelligence forming hybrid communities [6] and managing distributed
resources [10]. This is a call for hMAS: Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems [4] [5].

Among the success factors of the Web are a number of non-functional properties purpose-
fully enforced at design time including: simplicity, generality, portability, extensibility and
the systematic search for compatibility [8]. For instance, the simplicity meant, at the time,
accepting to simplify solutions (e.g. SGML vs. HTML, HTTP vs other protocols) but also
proposing viral approaches for adoption to learn to “weave by weaving” including copy-paste
facilities of Web pages codes to start to contribute and what will later become the wiki-way
too. The fact the Web proposal was put in the public domain by CERN in 1993 was also
critical in reaching the threshold in volume of attractive resources and trigger the network
effects and Metcalfe’s law. All these lessons learnt should be kept in mind when specifying
hMAS.

Making autonomous agents a first class abstraction of the Web architecture requires
importing important MAS concepts (environment, workspace, platform, situatedness, ob-
servability, organizations, norms, regulation, interactions). But to maintain extensibility

and  forward  compatibility  hMAS  must  be  a  friendly  architecture  for  all  types  of  agents  [9]: 
reactive vs cognitive, knowledge reasoning vs connectionist, stygmergy-oriented vs contractual 
protocol  ones,...  In  this  picture,  semantic Web  and  linked  data  [7]  have  a  key  role  to  play 
both  in  weaving  the  hypermedia  fabric  for  the  agents’  environment  and  in  providing  the 
semantics  to  capture  the  key  concepts  of  hMAS  in  ontologies  to  ensure  interoperability. 
Extensible  top  ontologies  are  needed  to  setup  the  architecture  and  support  extension  by 
domain-dependent  and  task-dependent  ontologies  needed  for  practical  concrete  applications. 
Linked  data  also  come  with  solutions  and  concepts  to  be  used  and  aligned  with  hMAS 
for  instance  LDP  [11]  principles  and  containers  or  languages  such  as  SPARQL  to  manipulate 
RDF  data,  SCHACL  to  validate  and  exchange  constraints,  and  extensions  such  as  LDScript 
to  program  on  top  of  linked  data  [12],  a  language  that  could  be  a  candidate  to  align  with 
agent programming languages.  For instance, the notion of norms in MAS could be positioned 
w.r.t.  rule  languages  and  validation  languages  like  SHACL  which  use  cases  already  include 
both  the  validation  of  outputs  and  inputs  of  a  software  and  the  validation  of  interactions 
with  a  human  like  we  would  have  in  hybrid  communities.

In  parallel, Web  of  things,  thin  servers  [13]  and  Digital  Twins  [14]  are  giving  more  and 
more  substance  to  the Web  resources  that  shadow  physical  resources.  The  URI  could  lead 
to  more  and  more  informed Web  resources  and  put  in  touch  a  variety  of  digital  twins  and 
autonomous agents with the potential of supporting multi-model approaches at an unpreceded 
scale.  Here  again,  the  linked  data  framework  holds  the  potential  for  deeply  linking  all  these 
models  [15].

To conclude,  one  of  the  hardest  tasks  for  Tim  Berners-Lee  in  the  early  90s  was  to  make 
people  imagine  a  world  with  a  fully  deploy  Web.  Years  later,  it  is  hard  to  imagine  a  world 
without  the  Web.  We  have  the  same  cold-start  problem  with  the  hMAS  and  we  need  to  find 
incentives  for  this  change  to  happen  and  to  reach  the  threshold  in  terms  of  usage  that  will 
trigger  the  network  effect a nd m ake i t g o v iral. T herefore, t ogether w ith a  p roposal o f a 
standard  architecture,  we  need  to  find i ncentives a nd a dded values f or h MAS t o b e t aken on 
by  industry  and  developers.
