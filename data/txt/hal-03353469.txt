Abstract
Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent advances in deep learning
and the availability of training data with more and more field photos. However, this profusion of data
concerns only a few tens of thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe,
much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical countries. On the other hand,
for several centuries, botanists have systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in
herbaria, especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community
have made it possible to put millions of digitised records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification
challenge (or "PlantCLEF 2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of
about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana Shield of South America, a region known to have one
of the highest plant diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain classification
task where the training set consisted of several hundred thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand
photos to allow learning a correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values of 5 morphological and
functional traits for each species. The test set consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This
article presents the resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the approaches
and systems used by the participating research groups and provides an analysis of the main results.

Automated identification of the living world has improved considerably in recent years.
In particular, in the LifeCLEF 2017 Plant Identification challenge, impressive identification
performances have been measured with recent deep learning models (e.g. up to 90% classification
accuracy on 10,000 species), and it was shown in [1] that automated systems are today not
so far from human expertise. However, these conclusions are only valid for species that live
predominantly in Europe and North America. Therefore, the LifeCLEF 2019 plant identification
challenge focused on tropical countries, where there are generally far fewer observations and
images collected and where the flora is much more difficult for human experts to identify.
In the meantime, biodiversity informatics initiatives such as iDigBio1 or e-ReColNat2 have made
millions of digitized herbarium sheets stored in many natural history museums over the world,

available online. Over more than 3 centuries, generations of botanists have systematically
collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria. These specimens have great
scientific value and are regularly used to study species variability, phylogenetic relationships,
evolution or phenological trends. In particular, one of the key step in the work of botanists and
taxonomists is to find the herbarium sheets that correspond to a new specimen observed in the
field. This task requires a high level of expertise and can be very tedious. The development of
automated tools to facilitate this work is therefore of crucial importance.
Following on from the PlantCLEF challenges held in previous years [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], a
new challenge was introduced in 2020 and designed to assess the extent to which automated
identification on flora in data-deficient regions can be improved by using natural history
collections of herbarium sheets. In tropical countries, many species are not easily available,
resulting in a very limited number of field-collected photographs, whereas several hundred or
even several thousand herbarium sheets have been collected over the centuries. Herbarium
collections potentially represent a large amount of data to train species prediction models, but
they also induce a much more difficult problem, usually called cross-domain classification task.
Indeed, a plant photographed in the field may have a very different visual appearance than its
dried version placed on a herbarium sheet (as illustrated in Figure 1).

1. Datasets and task description

1.1. Training set

1.1.1. Visual content

The task was based on a dataset of 997 species mainly focused on the Guiana shield and the
Northern Amazon rainforest (see Figure 2), an area known to have one of the greatest diversity
of plants and animals in the world. The dataset contains 321,270 herbarium sheets (see Table1 for
detailed information). About 12% were collected in French Guyana and hosted in the "Herbier
IRD de Guyane" (IRD Herbarium of French Guyana). These herbarium sheets were digitized in
the context of the e-ReColNat2 project. The remaining herbarium sheets come from the iDigBio1
portal (the US National Resource for Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections).

In order to enable learning a mapping between the two domains (i.e. between the "source"
domain of herbarium sheets and the "target" domain of field photos), a relatively smaller set of
6,316 photos in the field was provided additionally to the large herbarium sheets dataset. About
62 % of them also come from he iDigBio portal and were acquired by various photographers
related to numerous institutes and national museums that share their data in iDigBio. Besides,
two highly trusted experts of the French Guyana flora, Marie-Françoise Prévost "Fanchon" [11]
and Jean-François Molino3 provided the remaining field photos that were divided between the
training set and the test set.

A valuable asset of the training set is that a set of 354 plant observations are provided with
both herbarium sheets and field photos for the same individual plant. This potentially allows a
more precise mapping between the two domains (see previous Figure 1 as an example).
It should also be noted that about half of the species in the training set (495 to be precise) is only
represented by herbarium sheets which makes training a model even more difficult without the
presence of field photo examples.

dataset. Many species have also been collected in other regions outside French Guiana, over a large
part of the Americas, but also in Africa for some of them.

1.2. Traits metadata

Additional metadata at the species level expressing functional traits were introduced this year.
This is a very valuable information that can potentially help improve prediction models. Indeed,
it can be assumed that species which share the same functional traits also share to some extent
common visual appearances. This information can then potentially be used to guide the training
of a model through auxiliary loss functions for instance. The information was collected through
the Encyclopedia of Life API. The 5 most comprehensive traits have been verified and completed
by experts in Guyanese flora, so that each species has a value for each trait. Below we list the
names of the 5 traits as well as the possible values associated with these traits.

Plant growth form: describes which plant growth form can take a species among these
4 possibilities: climber, herb, shrub, tree. It is important to note that a species can sometimes
be associated with several forms of growth. For example, a young plant of the species Jus-
ticia betonica L. can be considered as an herb while in adulthood it would be described as a shrub.

Habitat: a set non standardised free tag(s) describing the typical habitats of a given species.
As examples, we can indicate the most frequently used tags: tropical, moist, broadleaf, forest,
flooded, grassland, rocky, non-wetland, savanna, shrubland, coastal.

Plant lifeform: refers to the physical support of development used by a species. Below
is a list of all possible values and their definitions:

• Aquatic plant.
• Epiphyte: an organism that grows on the surface of a plant and derives its moisture and
nutrients from the air, rain, water (in marine environments) or from debris accumulating
around it.

• Geophyte: species that develop organs for storing energy (water or carbohydrates).
• Helophyte: a plant that grows in or near water and is either emergent, submergent, or

floating.

• Hemiepiphyte: a plant that spends part of its life cycle as an epiphyte.
• Hydrophyte: close to helophyte.
• Lithophyte: plants that grow in or on rocks.
• Pleustophyte: a plant living in the thin surface layer existing at the air-water interface of

a body of water which serves as their habitat.

• Succulent plant: a plant with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and engorged, usually to

retain water in arid climates or soil conditions (close to geophyte).

• Terrestrial plant.

Trophic guild: can be common to any group of species that exploit the same resources, or that
exploit different resources in related ways.

• Carnivorous plant.
• Parasite: a plant that derives some or all of its nutritional requirement from another living

plant.

• Hemiparasite: partially parasite.
• Photoautotroph: a plant that is capable of synthesizing its own food from inorganic

substances using light as an energy source

• Saprotrophic: a plant which secrete digestive juices in dead and decaying matter and

convert it into a solution and absorb it.

Woodiness: expresses whether the species is capable of producing "lignin" (wood). Then, the
values are basically herb or woody.

1.3. Test set

The test set was composed of 3,186 photos in the field related to 638 plant observations (about 5
pictures per plants on average). To avoid bias related to similar pictures coming from neighboring
plants in the same observation site, we ensured that all observations of a given species by a
given collector were either in the training set or in the test set but never spread over the two
sets. For instance, for the observations of J.F. Molino, the 166 species in the test set are different
from the 125 species in the training set.

Most importantly, plant species in the test set were selected according to the number of field
photos illustrating them in the training set. As it can be observed in Figure 3 (a), the priority
was given to species with few or no field pictures at all. Such a choice may seem drastic, making
the task extremely difficult, but the underlying idea was to encourage and promote methods
that are as generic as possible, capable of transferring knowledge between the two domains,
even without any examples in the target domain for some classes. The second motivation of this
choice, was to impose a mapping between herbarium and field photos and avoid that classical
methods based on CNNs perform well because of an abundance of field photos in the training
set rather than the use of herbarium sheets.

Figure 3: Species according to the estimated number of images for each domain in the training set (in
blue). Each species is surrounded by an additional orange circle if it is used in the test set, and a red
circle if used in the test subset of difficult species (with few field photos according to the PlantCLEF
2021 the training set). The bottom graph revises the positions of the species by including additional
training pictures from external datasets that could be used by the participants. It is estimated that
most of the species related to the difficult test subset have less than 10 field photos.

1.4. External training sets

Participants to the evaluation were allowed to use complementary training data (e.g. for pre-
training purposes) but on the condition that (i) the experiment is entirely reproducible, i.e. that
the used external resource is clearly referenced and accessible to any other research group, (ii)
the use of external training data or not is clearly mentioned for each evaluated method, and (iii)
the additional resource does not contain any of the test observations. External training data
was thus allowed but participants had to provide at least one submission that used only the
training data provided this year. The organizers suggested two external datasets used in the
previous edition PlantCLEF2019 [10], [12].

1.5. Task Description

Evaluation metrics: the goal of the task was to identify the correct species of the 638 plant
of the test set. For every plant, the evaluated systems had to return a list of species, ranked
without ex-aequo. Each participating group was allowed to submit up to 10 run files built from
different methods or systems (a run file is a formatted text file containing the species predictions
for all test items).

The main evaluation measure for the challenge was the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which

is defined as the mean of the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the correct answer:

1
𝑄

𝑄
∑︁

𝑞=1

1
rank𝑞

where 𝑄 is the number of plant observations and rank𝑞 is the predicted rank of the true label
for the 𝑞th plant observation.

A second evaluation measure was again the MRR but computed on a subset of observations
of difficult species that are rarely photographed in the field. Species were selected based on
the most comprehensive estimate of the number of field photos from different data sources
(iDigBio, GBIF, Encyclopedia of Life, Bing and Google Image search engines). It is therefore a
more challenging metric because it focuses on the species which impose a mapping between
herbarium and field photos. Figure 3 (b) revises the previous Figure 3 (a) according to the
considered external data sources and shows that many plant observations in the difficult test
subset are related to species estimated to have less than 10 field photos.

Course of the challenge: the training data was publicly shared mid February 2021 through the
AICrowd platform4. Any research team wishing to participate in the evaluation could register
on the platform and download the data. The test data was shared in mid-April but without
the species labels, which were kept secret. Each team could then submit up to 10 submissions
corresponding to different methods or different settings of the same method. A submission (also
called a run) takes the form of a csv file containing the predictions of the method being evaluated
for all observations in the test set. For each submission, the calculation of the evaluation metrics
is then done automatically and visible to the participant. Once, the submission phase was closed

4https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/lifeclef-2021-plant

(mid May), the participants could also see the evaluation metric values of the other participants.
As a last important step, each participant was asked to provide a working note, i.e. a detailed
technical report containing all technical information required to reproduce the results of all
submissions. All LifeCLEF working notes are reviewed by at least two members of LifeCLEF
organizing committee to ensure a sufficient level of quality and reproducibility.

2. Participants and methods

About 30 teams/researchers registered for the PlantCLEF challenge 2021 and 4 of them finally
submitted runs. Details of the methods are developed in the individual working notes of the
participants (NeuonAI [13], Lehigh University [14]). The other teams did not provide a detailed
description of their systems, but some informal descriptions were sometimes provided in the
metadata associated with the submissions and partially contributed to the comments below.

Neuon AI, Malaysia, 7 runs [13]: the method is actually an extension of a previous approach
already successfully evaluated last year in PlantCLEF2020 [15]. It is based on a two-streamed
Herbarium-Field Triplet Loss Network (HTFL) to assess the similarity between herbarium and
field pairs thus matching species from both herbarium and field domains. This mechanism is
better at predicting observations of species with missing field images in the training set than
traditional CNNs. The general concept is to train the network with triplet samples (2 samples
from the same species and 1 from another species) to minimize the distance between the same
species and maximize the distance between different species. Then, an herbarium dictionary
is computed: each class (each specie)s is associated with an unique embedding computed as
the average of the random herbarium sheets from the class. For inference, a plant observation
is then associated with a unique embedding computed as the average of the embeddings of
all (augmented) field photos of the observation. Cosine similarity is used as a distance metric
between the embeddings of all herbarium classes and the embedding of the tested field obser-
vation. It is then transformed with inverse distance weighting into probabilities to rank the
classes.
The authors introduced this year several novelties to improve the method:

• They trained a complementary One-Streamed Mixed network (OSM) by taking both
herbarium and field images as input to learn the features of each species irrespective of
their domains. The learned features of the OSM network are used as a way to measure
the feature similarity between herbarium-field pairs instead of directly classifying them.
This mechanism allows for the prediction of classes where field images are missing in a
similar way triplet network does.

• Complementary dictionary for embedding: they showed that by adding field images to the
herbarium images for computing the herbarium dictionary, the “HFTL (field)” performs
better on difficult “unseen” species without field images in the training set, but worse
for species having field images in the training than the initial HTFL approach using only
herbarium sheets for computing the dictionary.

• Ensemble: instead of opposing the two ways of building dictionaries, they combine
the two approaches through an ensemble of networks. Finally, the best performances

are obtained when combining the HTLF, HTFL(field) and also OSM, all being built and
declined with two CNN architectures (Inception-v4 and Inception-ResNet-v2).

LU, Lehigh University, USA, 9 runs [14]: these participants started from the fact that al-
though many methods are proposed for domain adaptation, most of them are tested on small
domain divergence datasets, which may have lower transferability to large-divergence datasets,
and the data imbalance problem is not well addressed. To address these challenges, this par-
ticipant proposes to extend the CORAL loss [16] designed to align the distribution of the two
domains with two contributions:

• A weighted cross-entropy loss (optimized on the labeled samples and pseudo-labeled

samples) allowing to take into account the imbalance distribution of the classes

• A filtering of the used pseudo-labels to focus only on the ones with a sufficient degree
of confidence. The confidence threshold decreases over time to integrate progressively
more difficult test samples.

Unlike the approach developed by NeuonAI or the organizer’s submissions (see below), these
participants do not seem to have used external data, which may partially explain the difference
in performance despite a promising and interesting approach. Moreover, we can notice that
both Neuon and LU teams did not exploit in their approaches the new trait metadata introduced
this year.

Organizer’s submissions, 7 runs: the purpose of these submissions was to measure whether
or not the functional trait metadata introduced this year could help improve the performance
of a system initially exploiting only image data. The submissions are based on the "winning"
solution from the previous year designed by Juan Villacis, a former student from the TEC
Costa Rica and the Pl@ntNet team [17]. The method uses a Few Shot Adversarial Domain
Adaptation approach [18] (FSADA) where the purpose is to learn a domain agnostic feature
space while preserving the discriminative ability of the features for performing the species
classification task. First, a ResNet50 is finetuned in the herbarium sheets only and used then as
an encoder to extract features on both herbarium sheets or field photos. Then, given random
pairs of extracted features, a discriminator is trained to distinguish 4 categories: (1) different
domains and different classes, (2) different domains and same class, (3) same domain and
different classes, (4) same domain and same classes. Finally, during a last stage, the encoder,
the discriminator and the classifier are trained together. Domain adaptation is achieved once
the discriminator is not able to distinguish samples from categories (1) and (2) and categories
(3) and (4), when the discriminator is not able to tell which was the original domain. The best
single model was an extension with 3 classifiers and 3 discriminators using 3 taxonomic levels
(species, genus, family), while using external datasets (PlantCLEF 2019[10] and GBIF [12]). This
previous best solution was retrained and again submitted this year as "Organizer’s submission 3"
(submissions 1 & 2 didn’t use the genus and family levels, and submission 1 didn’t use external
data). Following the same idea, the organizer’s submissions 4, 5, 6 extended the submission 3 by
introducing additional discriminators and classifiers related to the traits, respectively "plant
lifeform" (10 classes), "woodiness" (2 classes), "plant growthform" (using actually in this specific
case 4 independent discriminators and binary classifiers related to the 4 values "climber", "herb",

Reciprocal Rank over the entire test set.

"shrub", "tree"). Submission 7 used a total of 10 discriminators and classifiers exploiting the 3
taxonomic levels and traits mentioned just before.

3. Results

We report in Figure 4 and Table 2 the performances achieved by the 29 evaluated runs. Figure
5 reorganizes the results according to the second MRR metric focusing on the most difficult
species, while Figure 6 adds the organizer’s submissions in the initial Figure 4.

The main outcomes we can derive from that results are the following ones:

The most difficult PlantCLEF challenge ever. Traditional classification models based on
CNNs perform very poorly on the task. Domain Adaptation methods (DA) based on CNNs
perform much better but the task remains difficult even with these dedicated techniques. The
best submitted run barely approaches a MRR of 0.2.

External data improves DA approaches. The best submissions from NeuonAI and the or-
ganizers used both complementary external data (the PlantCLEF2017 dataset [8] for NeuonAI

Figure 5: PlantCLEF 2021 evaluation results based on the secondary metric, i.e. the Mean Reciprocal
Rank over the subset of difficult species with few or no field photos in the training set.

while the organizer’s submissions used a GBIF collection [12] and the PlantCLEF2019 dataset
[10]). The impact of external data can be highlighted when comparing runs 1 & 2 from the
organizers for instance where the MRR increases from 0.052 to 0.153. LU team used only used
the relatively small number of field photos provided in the PlantCLEF2021 dataset, which may
partially explain why their submissions have lower performance.

Genericity and stability. Regarding the difference between the two MRR metrics (whole test
set vs. difficult species), the NeuonAI team demonstrated that it is possible to achieve equivalent
and quite good performance for all species, even those that have few or no field photos at all in
the training dataset. This impressive genericity is mainly obtained by the use of an ensemble of
several two-streamed Herbarium-Field Triplet Loss (HFTL) networks and several One-Streamed
Mixed (OSM) networks. Rather than focusing on learning a common feature invariant domain
as for the other team’s submissions, the NeuonAI’s approach focuses on a deep metric learning
on features embeddings. For the ensemble, they combined through their submissions various
combinations of (a) different CNN architectures (Inception-ResNet-v2 and Inception-V4), (b)
whether or not to add to the herbarium pictures the field photos for the calculation of class
embbedings, and (c) different levels of data augmentation. NeuonAI Run 7, which used 3 HTFL

networks, all adding field photos for the class embbedings, and 2 OSM networks, achieved the
best scores over the participants, for both MRR metrics. Looking solely at the the second MRR
score, this approach seems to be more effective in transferring knowledge to the least frequently
photographed species in the field, which was the most difficult goal to achieve.

Multi-task approaches have a positive impact on performance, especially when using
the taxonomy genus, family and some of the species traits. By adding auxiliary tasks to the
FSADA approach as mentioned in [17], the genus and family information help the discriminators
and the classifiers to learn a better domain invariant feature space, and contribute to improve
significantly the performance (see Organizer’s submissions 2 & 3 where the MRR increases
from 0.153 to 0.183). Organizer’s submissions 4, 5 and 6 extended this approach by adding
an auxiliary task related to the trait species information. This appeared to also contribute to
improve performance. All these auxiliary tasks based on traits contributed to improve the
performances, even slightly as for the “woodiness" trait.

The most informative species trait is the “plant growth form". Organizer’s submissions
4, 5 and 6 demonstrate that adding auxiliary tasks based on species traits improves performance.
As hypothesised, it seems to help gathering and discriminating wide groups of plant species

sharing similar visual aspects (such as tendrils for climber plants, typical large leaves for tropical
trees against smaller leaves for shrubs or long thin leaves and frequent flowers for herbs). Finally,
the last organizer’s submission 7 combining a total of 8 auxiliary tasks resulted in the highest
score for the primary MRR metric over the challenge, but half as good as the best NeuonAI’s
submission regarding the second MRR metric focusing on the very difficult species to identify.

4. Conclusion

This paper presented the overview and the results of the LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification
challenge following the 10 previous editions conducted within CLEF evaluation forum. This
year’s task was particularly challenging, focusing on species rarely photographed in the field in
the northern tropical Amazon. The results revealed that the last advances in domain adaptation
enable the use of herbarium data to facilitate the identification of rare tropical species for which
no or very few other training photos are available. A mapping domain adaptation technique
based on a two-streamed Herbarium-Field triplet loss network reached an impressive genericity
by obtaining quite high similar results regardless of whether the species have many or very few
field photos in the training set. We believe that the proposed task may be in the future a new
baseline dataset in the field of domain adaptation, and motivate new contributions through a
realistic and crucial usage for the plant biology research community.
