Abstract 
Surfactin is a lipoheptapeptide produced by several Bacillus species and identified for the first time in 
1969.  At  first,  the  biosynthesis  of  this  remarkable  biosurfactant  was  described  in  this  review.  The 
peptide  moiety  of  the  surfactin  is  synthesized  using  huge  multienzymatic  proteins  called 
NonRibosomal Peptide Synthetases. This mechanism is responsible for the peptide biodiversity of the 
members of the surfactin family. In addition, on the fatty acid side, fifteen different isoforms (from 
C12  to  C17)  can  be  incorporated  so  increasing  the  number  of  the  surfactin-like  biomolecules.  The 
review also highlights the last development in metabolic modelling and engineering and in synthetic 
biology to direct surfactin biosynthesis but also to generate novel derivatives. This large set of different 
biomolecules leads to a broad spectrum of physico-chemical properties and biological activities. The 
last  parts  of  the  review  summarized  the  numerous  studies  related  to  the  production  processes 
optimization as well as the approaches developed to increase the surfactin productivity of Bacillus cells 
taking  into  account  the  different  steps  of  its  biosynthesis  from  gene  transcription  to  surfactin 
degradation in the culture medium. 

Introduction 

1 
Surfactin was firstly isolated in 1968 by Arima et al. as a new biologically active compound produced 
by  Bacillus  with  surfactant  activities,  leading  to  its  appellation.  Its  structure  was  elucidated  firstly 
through its amino acid sequence (Kakinuma, Hori, et al., 1969) and then its fatty acid chain (Kakinuma, 
Sugino, et al., 1969). Surfactin was thus characterized as a lipopeptide composed of a heptapeptide 
with  the  following  sequence:  L-Glu1-L-Leu2-D-Leu3-L-Val4-L-Asp5-D-Leu6-L-Leu7,  forming  a 
lactone ring structure with a β-hydroxy fatty acid chain. Bearing both, a hydrophilic peptide portion 
and a lipophilic fatty acid chain, surfactin is of amphiphilic nature, leading to exceptional biosurfactant 
activities and diverse biological activities. 
Surfactins are actually considered as a family of lipopeptides, sharing common structural traits with a 
great structural diversity due to the type of amino acids in the peptide chain and the length and isomery 
of the lipidic chain (Ongena et al., 2008). More than one thousand variants can potentially be naturally 
synthesized. This remarkable biodiversity mainly results from their biosynthetic mechanism. 
This  review  is  composed  of  4  main  sections.  At  first,  a  detailed  description  of  the  biosynthesis 
mechanisms will allow to understand origin of the biodiversity. Secondly, the diversity of variants will 
be seen, as well as its enhancement possibilities.  Thirdly, the link between surfactin’s varying structure 
and its properties and activities will be described. Lastly, the production process and its optimisation 
will be discussed, either for the whole surfactin family or for specific variants. 

Biosynthesis of surfactins

2.1  Peptide moiety 
Surfactins, as most of the cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs), are not synthesized ribosomally, but rather by 
specialized  systems,  termed  non-ribosomal  peptide  synthetases  (NRPSs).  NRPSs  are  multimodular 
mega-enzymes, consisting of repeated modules. A module is defined as a portion of the NRPS that 
incorporates one specific amino acid into a peptide backbone. The order of the modules is usually co-
linear with the product peptide sequence. Each module can in turn be dissected into the following three 
domains: the adenylation (A) domain, the thiolation (T) domain (“-syn. peptidyl-carrier protein (PCP)-
“) and the condensation (C) domain (Marahiel et al., 1997; Roongsawang et al., 2011). The A-domain

recognizes, selects and activates the specific amino acid of interest (Dieckmann et al., 1995). Taking 
into account the 3D-structures of several adenylation domains and their active site, several tools have 
been set up to correlate the amino acid residue present in this active site and their substrate specificity. 
A NRPS code was so defined that it is based on 8 amino acid residues from the active site (Stachelhaus 
et al., 1996; Rausch et al., 2005). The activated amino acid is hereby covalently bonded as a thioester 
to the flexible 4'-phosphopantetheinyl (4'-Ppant) arm of the T-domain. The 4'-Ppant prosthetic group 
is 20 Å in length and can swing from one to another adjacent catalytic centre. Exactly this flexibility 
enables the transfer of the activated amino acid substrate to the C-domain, which catalyzes in turn (i) 
the formation of a peptide bond between the nascent peptide and the amino acid carried by the adjacent 
module  and  allows  afterwards  (ii)  the  translocation  of  the  growing  chain  to  the  following  module. 
Various  functional  subtypes  of  the  C  domain  have  been  described.  For  example,  an  LCL  domain 
catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between two L-amino acids while a DCL domain between a 
L-amino  acid  and  a  growing  peptide  ending  with  a  D-amino  acid (Rausch  et  al.,  2007).    The  first 
module (A-T module) is considered the initiation module, while the subsequent (C-A-T) modules are 
defined  as  elongation  modules.  After  several  module-mediated  cycles  of  peptide  extension,  the 
complete linear intermediate peptide is released by the terminal thioesterase (TE) domain which, often, 
catalyzes  an  internal  cyclization  (Marahiel  et  al.,  1997;  Trauger  et  al.,  2000).  Besides  the  above 
mentioned domains, the NPRS assembly line can furthermore comprise additional optional domains, 
which  catalyze  modifications  of  amino  acid  building  blocks  e.g.  their  epimerization  (E-domains)  
(Süssmuth  et  al.,  2017).  The  lipid  moiety  of  surfactins  and  most  of  the  microbial  lipopeptides  is 
introduced directly at the start of the biosynthesis. The initiation module features a C-A-T- instead of 
a classic A-T-structure (Sieber et al., 2005; Bloudoff et al., 2017). It contains a special N-terminal C-
domain, termed C-starter (CS) domain and is in charge of the linkage of a CoA-activated β-hydroxy 
fatty acid to the first amino acid. The activated fatty acid stems foremost from the primary metabolism 
(Figure 1). 
Three decades ago, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of the CLP surfactin was described in parallel 
by different research groups (Nakano et al., 1988; Cosmina et al., 1993; Fuma et al., 1993; Sinderen et 
al., 1993). The structural genes were identified in B. subtilis and are formed by the four biosynthetic 
core NRPS genes srfAA, srfAB, srfAC and srfAD (Figure 1) which code together for a heptamodular 
NRPS assembly line. The three-modular enzyme SrfAA contains N-terminally the typical CS-domain 
of CLP-BGCs and acylates the first amino acid Glu1 with various 3-OH-fatty acids stemming from 
primary  metabolism. The  peptide  is  subsequently  extended  in  a  co-linear  fashion  by  the  elongation 
modules of SrfAA, SrfAB and SrfAC to yield a linear heptapeptide (FA-L-Glu1-L-Leu2-D-Leu3-L-
Val4-L-Asp5-D-Leu6-L-Leu7). The inverted stereochemistry can be readily attributed to the presence 
of E-domains in modules M3 and M6 and DCL domains in modules M4 and M7 (Figure 1). Finally, the 
TE domain of SrfAC releases the lipopeptide and performs the macrocyclization between Leu7 and 
the hydroxy-group of the 3-OH fatty acid. Notably, SrfAD consist solely of a second TE-domain, which 
represents  rather  a  supportive repair  enzyme  and is  able  to regenerate  misprimed T-domains  during 
NRPS assembly (Schneider et al., 1998; Schwarzer et al., 2002; Yeh et al., 2004). 
Beside  the  structural  NRPS  genes,  the  surfactin  BGC  comprises  one  built-in  and  several  adjacent 
accessory  genes  encoding  e.g.  transporters  and  regulatory  proteins  (MiBIG  Accession  No:

BG0000433). Amongst these, we would like to further highlight the genes sfp, ycxA, krsE, yerP and 
comS, which are particularly related with the production yield of surfactin.  
Sfp  represents  a  phosphopantetheinyl  transferase  (PPTase)  and  is  located  approximately  4  kb 
downstream of the srf BGC. The T-domain of an NRPS is, upon its expression, not directly active but 
rather exists nascent in its non-functional apo-form. For full functionality, the flexible 4'-Ppant arm 
needs to be fused to the T-domain. The latter process is mediated by the PPTase Sfp, thereby converting 
all T-domains of the surfactin BGC into their active holo form (Quadri et al., 1998; Mootz et al., 2001). 
This fact makes Sfp indispensable for the production of surfactin (Tsuge et al., 1999). For example, in 
the reference strain, Bacillus subtilis 168, the sfp locus is truncated and therefore non-functional, which 
abolishes in turn surfactin production. However, the production can be restored by the transfer of a 
complete sfp locus (Nakano et al., 1988, 1992). 
Further important genes in the context of surfactin production are genes encoding transporters which 
are  efflux  pumps.  From  a  physiologically  point  of  view,  the  pumps  avoid  intracellular  surfactin 
accumulation and constitute an essential self-resistance mechanism (Tsuge et al., 2001). In particular 
since surfactin inserts into biomembranes and at higher concentration causes membrane disruption. An 
ecological rationale for transporters could be that surfactin is extracellularly at the correct site where it 
can  exert  its  beneficial  activity.  So  far,  three  transporters  have  been  identified  in  Bacilli,  that  are 
involved  in  surfactin  efflux,  i.e. YcxA,  KrsE  and YerP.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  separate 
overexpression of the corresponding genes enhanced release rates of surfactin (Li et al., 2015) by 89%, 
52% and 145%, respectively. 
Finally, the surfactin BGC exhibits a unique peculiarity on the genetic level, in bearing a co-encoded 
regulatory gene, termed comS inside itself (D’Souza et al., 1994). It is located in the open reading frame 
of  the  NRPS  gene  srfAB  (Hamoen  et  al.,  1995),  more  precisely  within  the A-domain  of  module  4 
(Figure 1). ComS is on the one hand involved in the positive regulation of the genetic competence of 
the cell (Liu et al., 1998) and on the other hand part of the quorum sensing system comQXPA (Ansaldi 
et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2002; Auchtung et al., 2006) which in turn regulates surfactin production. 
Beyond this brief explanation, for an excellent overview about the role of ComS, the reader is referred 
to a review, written by Stiegelmeyer and Giddings (Stiegelmeyer et al., 2013). Since the production 
yield is coupled with the presence and functionality of ComS in the coding region of srfAB, the genetic 
engineering of the surfactin synthetase in this region requires special attention. 

2.2  Fatty acid chain synthesis 
Since fatty acid biosynthesis plays a critical role in surfactin production, and strongly determines its 
activity and properties, in this section we briefly summarize this central metabolic pathway and the 
subsequent steps leading to the modification and activation of the fatty acyl-CoA precursor. 
All organisms employ a conserved set of chemical reactions to achieve the de novo Fatty Acid (FA) 
biosynthesis, which works by the sequential extension of the growing carbon chain, two carbons at a 
time, through a series of decarboxylative condensation reactions (Wakil et al., 1983) (Figure 2). This 
biosynthetic route proceeds in two stages: initiation and iterative cyclic elongation. The acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase  enzyme  complex  (ACC)  performs  the  first  committed  step  in  bacterial  FA  synthesis  to 
generate malonyl-CoA through the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA (Marini et al., 1995; Tong, 2013). The 
malonate  group  from  malonyl-CoA  is  transferred  to  the  acyl  carrier  protein  (ACP)  by  a  malonyl-

CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD) (Serre et al., 1994, 1995; Morbidoni et al., 1996). The first reaction for 
the synthesis of the nascent carbon chain comprises the condensation of malonyl-ACP with a short-
chain acyl-CoA (C2–C5) catalyzed by a 3-keto-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH). Acetyl-CoA is 
used as a  substrate for the synthesis of straight-chain FA, while branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) 
arise  from  isobutyryl-CoA,  isovaleryl-CoA  and  methylbutyryl-CoA  priming  substrates.  These 
precursors  derive,  from  the  catabolism  of  the  branched-chain  amino  acids  valine,  leucine  and 
isoleucine,  respectively.  The  crucial  branched-chain  α-keto  acid  decarboxylase  (BKD)  complex 
catalyzes the decarboxylation of α-keto acids to generate the corresponding branched-chain acyl-CoA 
primers (Willecke et al., 1971; Kaneda, 1991; Lu et al., 2004). The substrate specificity of FabH plays 
a determining role in the branched/straight and even/odd characteristics of the fatty acid produced. B. 
subtilis  possesses  two  FabH  isoenzymes,  FabHA  and  FabHB,  both  of  which  preferentially  utilize 
branched-chain acyl-CoA primers (Choi et al., 2000). Therefore, BCFA are the main components of 
phospholipids, where iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, iso-C17:0, and anteiso-C17:0 represent the 
major FA found in Bacillus species (Kaneda, 1969; Kämpfer, 1994). The pattern of the BCFA can be 
modified by environmental conditions such as temperature (Graumann et al., 1999).   
Next,  the  keto-acyl-ACP  product  of FabH  condensation  enters  the  elongation/reducing  cycle  of  the 
fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II). There, the keto group is reduced by the NADPH dependent β-ketoacyl-
ACP  reductase  (FabG)  to  give  β-hydroxy-acyl-ACP.  The  β-hydroxyacyl-ACP  intermediate  is  then 
dehydrated  to  trans-2-enoyl-ACP  by  a  3-hydroxyacyl-ACP  dehydratase  (FabZ). Then,  the  cycle  is 
completed by an enoyl-ACP reductase, which reduces the double bond in trans-2-enoyl-ACP to form 
acyl-ACP (Fujita et al., 2007). B. subtilis possesses two enoyl-ACP reductases (FabI and FabL) with 
opposite preferences for the NADPH or NADH cofactor (Heath et al., 2000). 
In  all  the  successive  steps  of  FA  elongation,  the  acyl-ACP  intermediate  and  malonyl-ACP  are  the 
substrates of FabF condensing enzyme (3-oxoacyl-ACP-synthase II) that elongates the growing acyl 
chain and initiate each new round of the cycle (Schujman et al., 2001). Finally, the acyl-ACPs of the 
proper  chain  length  are  substrates  of  acyltransferases  involved  in  cell  membrane  phospholipid 
synthesis.  Alternatively,  some  structurally  specific  FA  are  not  integrated  in  the  cell  membrane 
phospholipids.  Those  modified  FA  could  be,  under  specific  environmental  or  growth  conditions, 
channelled into secondary metabolic pathways. They are then a of specialized molecules, as it is the 
case of lipopeptides. 
Once the long chain FA is synthesized, the next steps needed for surfactin biosynthesis involves the 
production  of  the  3-hydroxy-acyl-coenzyme A  (CoA)  substrates.  Youssef  et  al.,  based  on  in  vitro 
assays, suggested that acyl 3-hydroxylation occurs prior to CoA ligation (Youssef et al., 2011). These 
authors  reported  that  YbdT,  a  cytochrome  P450  enzyme,  catalyzes  the  hydroxylation  of  the  FA 
precursors  to  be  incorporated  in  the  lipopeptide  biosynthetic  pathway  (Youssef  et  al.,  2011). 
Cytochrome P450 are monooxigenases capable of introducing an oxygen atom into FA and in other 
lipidic and non-lipidic molecules. The B. subtilis genome contains eight genes coding for cytochrome 
P450 enzymes (Hlavica et al., 2010). In vitro, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
gas  chromatography–mass  spectrometry  analyses  demonstrated  that  the  recombinant  ybdT  gene 
product hydroxylates myristic acid in the presence of H2O2, to produce β-hydroxymyristic acid and α-
hydroxymyristic  acid  (Matsunaga  et  al.,  1999).  Furthermore,  a  ybdT  mutant  strain  of  B.  subtilis

OKB105 produces biosurfactants with only 2.2% of 3-hydroxylated C14, while the 97.8% contained 
non-hydroxylated FA with chain lengths of C12, and C14–C18 (Youssef et al., 2011) and are thus linear. 
Finally,  the  surfactin  synthetase  assembly  line  can  be  initiated  in  presence  of  a  CoA-activated  FA 
(Steller et al., 2004). Fatty acids are converted into their corresponding acyl-CoA derivative by fatty 
acyl CoA ligases (FACS). Of the four putative FACS identified in homology searches in the genome 
of  B.  subtilis,  two  of  them, LcfA  and YhfL,  were  characterized  in  vitro  to  be  involved  in  surfactin 
production. HPLC-MS based FACS activity assays indicated that LcfA and YhfL catalyze the thioester 
formation with CoA and various FA substrates (3-OH C8, 3-OH C10, C12 and C14). All four single 
mutants in the FACS homolog genes, lcfA, yhfL, yhfT and yngI, decreased surfactin production by 38% 
-  55%,  compared  with  the  wild-type  levels.  Interestingly,  a  quadruple  mutant  in  the  FACS  did  not 
completely  abolish  surfactin  biosynthesis,  such  strain  still  presents  16%  surfactin  production, 
compared with the levels produced by the wild-type strain. This observation suggests that other non-
canonical FACS are present in B. subtilis or that other pathways, such as transthiolation from ACPs to 
CoA, could be involved in providing the fatty acyl moiety. 
The hydroxylated and CoA activated FA derivative is finally transferred onto the surfactin synthetase 
assembly  line,  in  a  reaction  performed  by  the  N-terminal  condensation  (CS)  domain,  that  is  as 
mentioned above responsible for the lipoinitiation mechanism. In vitro, the recombinant dissected C 
domain, catalyzed the acylation reaction using glutamate-loaded PCP domain and 3-OH-C14-CoA as 
substrates (Kraas et al., 2010). 

3.  Variants of surfactin 

The surfactin biosynthesis mechanism previously described is responsible for the high biodiversity of 
surfactin-like molecules. In addition, the assembly line machinery of surfactin synthetases can be easily 
modified by synthetic biology in order to increase this biodiversity. Both aspects will be developed in 
the following chapter. 

3.1.Natural variants 
Three main peptide backbones and the NRPSs responsible for their biosynthesis, produced by different 
Bacillus  species,  have  been  so far  described  in  literature:  surfactin  as  previously  described from  B. 
subtilis,  B.  amyloliquefaciens,  B.  velezensi  and  B.  spizizeni  amongst  others,  pumilacidin  from  B.  
pumilus (Naruse et al., 1990) and lichenysin from B. licheniformis (Horowitz et al., 1990). Compared 
to surfactin, pumilacidin has a leucine in position 4 instead of a valine, as well as an isoleucine or a 
valine in position 7 instead of a leucine. Lichenysin differs from surfactin by a change in the first amino 
acid residue: a glutamine (Gln) instead of a glutamic acid (Figure 3). 
This first biosynthetic diversity in surfactin is increased by the promiscuous specificity of adenylation 
domains of modules 2, 4 and 7 of surfactin synthetases which are able to accept L-Leu, L-Val or L-Ile 
amino  acids  residues  as  well  as  L-Ala  for  module  4.  Similarly  low  levels  of  specificity  have  been 
observed for lichenysin (Peypoux et al., 1991; Bonmatin et al., 2003). 
Based on all these results, it appears that the aspartic acid in position 5, as well as the D-Leucine in 
position  3  and  6  are  present  in  all  the  members  of  the  surfactin  family.  The  only  mention  of  an 
asparagine (Asn) for lichenysin (Yakimov et al., 1995) was quickly refuted by the same author after 
the use of fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (Yakimov et al., 1999). The specificity of M3

and  M6  could  result  from  (i)  an  enzyme  of the  assembly  line  machinery  such  as  the  epimerisation 
domain which could accept only leucine as substrate, (ii) from the specificity of the adenylation domain 
or (iii) from the specificity of the involved condensation domains. 
The  changes  in  the  peptide  chain  are  not  the  only  source  of  diversity  in  the  surfactin  family. As 
mentioned  before,  surfactin  is  a  heptapeptide  linked  to  a  fatty  acid  chain.  Regarding  this  chain,  the 
length of it can vary from 12 to 17 carbons atoms, mainly being C14 and C15. 
Another change in this lipid chain is its isomery, it can have a linear, n, configuration, but it can also 
be branched, iso and anteiso. Anteiso can only be in an uneven carbon chain length, while iso can be 
found in all chain lengths (odd and even-numbered carbon chain). These derivatives can be mainly 
explained  by  the  promiscuity  of  the  CS-domain  present  in  module  M1  towards  its  relaxed  substrate 
specificity. 
Finally,  natural  linear  surfactins  (Figure  3)  have  been  also  identified  in  the  culture  supernatant  of 
Bacillus strains (Gao et al., 2017). The molecular mechanism responsible for this linearization is not 
yet  known.  It  could  result  from  an  incomplete  efficacy  of  TE  domain  which  could  release  some 
surfactin without cyclization or from enzymatic or chemical degradation of cyclic surfactin. 
In addition, heterologous enzymes are also capable to catalyze linearization. An in vitro study showed 
the linearisation effect of a purified V8 endoprotease from Staphylococcus aureus (Grangemard et al., 
1999).  Furthermore,  an  in  vivo  study  demonstrated  that  Streptomyces  sp.  Mg1  produces,  as  a 
mechanism of resistance, an enzyme that hydrolyses surfactin into its linear form (Hoefler et al., 2012). 
Surfactin methyl ester was observed in the supernatant of Bacillus subtilis HSO121 (Liu et al., 2009), 
and a methylated product of surfactin with a valine in position 7 was discovered  in the supernatant of 
a  Bacillus  mangrove  bacteria  strain  (Tang  et  al.,  2007).  This  change  was  also  discovered  in  the 
supernatant of Bacillus licheniformis HSN221 with surfactin and lichenysin methyl esters  (Li et al., 
2010) and in the culture medium of Bacillus pumilus through surfactin methyl ester (Zhuravleva et al., 
2010). 

3.2.Synthetic and biosynthetic variants 
In addition to the natural surfactins seen before, synthetic variants can be obtained through chemical 
modifications  or  genetic  engineering  of  the  NRPS.  This  leads  to  new  forms  or  to  a  controlled 
production of a specific form. Reasons for structural changes are manifoldly given, foremost to reduce 
the toxicity of surfactin, but also to optimize its biological activities or to increase its water solubility. 
Esterification can be achieved through chemical treatment with alcohol, reacting with the Asp-β- and/or 
Glu-γ-carboxyl group, producing monoester and/or diester-surfactin (Figure 3). 
For example, reaction of surfactin with n-hexyl alcohol lead to mono- and di-hexyl-surfactin, with 2-
methoxyethanol to mono- and di-2-methoxy-ethyl-surfactin (Shao et al., 2015). Amidation through a 
reaction with alcohol and then NH4Cl was also observed (Morikawa et al., 2000). Esterification and 
amidation of aspartic and glutamic acid eliminate the negative charge of those amino acid residues, 
creating an even greater diversity in the surfactin family because of the charge change that they bring 
and thus the modification in surfactin biological and surfactant properties. 
Linearization of the cyclic surfactin previously mentioned as a natural process can also be obtained by 
chemical alkaline treatment (Figure 3) (Eeman et al., 2006).

In  addition  to  those  chemical  modifications  of  surfactin  naturally  produced,  synthetic  forms  can  be 
chemically produced (Figure 3). Liquid phase techniques have been used at first (Nagai et al., 1996) 
but, because of the many steps and the purification of intermediates needed, it was replaced with a 
quicker  solid  phase  peptide  synthesis  (SPPS)  technique.  Different  forms  of  surfactins  have  been 
produced, such as standard surfactin, but also analogues with a change in the amino acid sequence, 
such as an epimerisation (D-Leu2), a change in charge (Asn5) and the switch of two residues (Asp4-
Leu5) (Pagadoy et al., 2005). Linear surfactin was also produced, as well as linear with an amidated 
carboxy-terminus  function  (Dufour  et  al.,  2005).  Finally,  the  fatty  acid  chain  length  was  likewise 
changed, with C10 and C18 (Francius et al., 2008). However, due to the complexity of the production, 
these lipopeptides are intended only for research use. 
As said before, in addition to the chemical changes, the genetic engineering can be also applied to the 
genes  coding  for  the  NRPS,  in  order  to  modify  the  structure  of  surfactin.  The  generation  of  novel 
derivatives by rational design can hereby be achieved by site directed mutagenesis, module- insertion, 
deletion and substitution (Alanjary et al., 2019). Application of the site directed mutagenesis technique, 
an A-domain specificity of an NRPS module shift from L-Glu to L-Gln and from L-Asp to L-Asn at 
position 5 in modules 1 and 5 was accomplished, respectively (Eppelmann et al., 2002). 
Concerning the concept of module substitutions, particularly the Marahiel group showed in a ground 
breaking  way  from  the  mid  90s  onwards  the  feasibility  of  module  swaps  which  allowed  single  or 
multiple variations concerning all seven amino acids (Stachelhaus et al., 1995, 1996; Schneider et al., 
1998; Eppelmann et al., 2002). As a practical aspect, beside the gain in basic research knowledge, for 
several  modified  surfactins,  such  as  Cys7-surfactin,  a  decreased  hemolytic  activity  was  observed. 
Furthermore,  ring  contracted  surfactin  derivatives  were  obtained  by  deletion  of  complete  NRPS 
modules.  In  this  way,  the  corresponding  knockouts  yielded  hexapeptidic  surfactin  congeners, 
individually lacking Leu2, Leu3, Asp5 and Leu6. Notably, the ∆Leu2 ∆Leu3 and the ∆Leu6 surfactin 
variants showed a reduced toxicity towards erythrocytes and enhanced  antibacterial activities, while 
the ∆Asp5 surfactin exhibited an even higher inhibitory ability for Gram positive bacteria, but kept the 
hemolytic capabilities of the native surfactin (Mootz et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2016). However, each 
genetic  manipulation  mentioned  above  resulted  in  a  significant  decrease  in  the  production  yield. 
Nevertheless, these studies showed the feasibility and moreover demonstrated in an encouraging way 
that  the  surfactin  scaffold  can  be  fine-tuned  concerning  its  intended  activity  and  its  undesired  side 
effects. 
Very recently, the Bode group revolutionized the concept of module swapping. It includes the finding 
that C-domains have to be subdivided into a CDonor (CD) and CAcceptor (CA) portion and that both are 
amino-acid specific (Bozhüyük et al., 2019). This redefines nowadays the borders of an exchange unit. 
Instead of a classic A, A-T or C-A-T domain swap, it is preferable to exchange a CD-A-T-CA domain 
unit  (Figure  4).  The  huge  advantage  of  these  findings  is  that  peptide-variants  can  be  generated  by 
genetic engineering at a much higher success rate and without any production loss. The technique will 
be  an  incentive  to  modify  highly  bioactive  structures,  such  as  surfactin. The  exchange  units  can  be 
derived from other Bacilli or codon-optimized from other bacterial genera. Particularly, in combination 
with  synthetic  biology,  in  future  numerous  genetically-engineered  modifications  can  be  envisioned: 
beside  the  exchange  of  amino  acids,  ring  contractions  by  module  deletion  and  ring  expansions,  by 
addition of an exchange unit, can be generated, respectively (Figure 4). Since peptides, containing D-

configured  amino  acids  are  less  prone  to  degradation,  the  change  of  the  absolute  configuration  by 
insertion  of  epimerization  domains  could  lead  to  derivatives  that  are  less  prone  to  enzymatic 
degradation.  Furthermore,  since  the  biotechnological  production  of  surfactin  always  results  in  the 
production of complex mixtures, e.g. varying in the fatty acid portion, it would be desirable to produce 
surfactin with a more defined lipid moiety. For this purpose, the biobrick-like exchange of the CDonor-
portion of the CS-domain could lead to the incorporation of the desired 3-OH fatty acid. Finally, it can 
be also envisioned to modify the surfactin NRPS assembly line even further, e.g. by introduction of 
catalytic domains which drive intramolecular cyclization-, N-methylation-, hydroxylation- and redox-
reactions. 

4.  Structure and properties relationship 
Surfactins and surfactin-like molecules are amphiphilic molecules with a polar part mainly constituted 
by  the two  negatively  charged  amino  acid  residues  Glu  and Asp  (in  native  surfactin)  and  an  apolar 
domain formed by the lateral groups of aliphatic amino acid residues (mainly Leu) and the fatty acid 
chain. This amphiphilic structure is responsible for its attractive physico-chemical properties as well 
as its various biological activities. 

4.1.Surfactin structure and its influence on physico-chemical properties and biological activites 
The amphiphilic structure of surfactins leads to strong surface activity, i.e. their capacity to reduce the 
surface/interfacial  tension  and  to  self-assembly  in  nanostructures,  and  the  presence  of  negative 
charge(s). Thus, they display as physico-chemical properties foaming (Razafindralambo et al., 1998; 
Fei et al., 2020), emulsifying (Deleu et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2015; Long et al., 2017; Fei et al., 2020) 
and dispersing properties, solid surface wetting and surface hydrophobicity modification performance 
(Ahimou et al., 2000; Shakerifard et al., 2009; Marcelino et al., 2019; Fei et al., 2020), and chelating 
ability (Mulligan et al., 1999; Grangemard et al., 2001; Eivazihollagh et al., 2019). This strong surface 
activity  leads  to  detergent  applications  (Zezzi  do  Valle  Gomes  et  al.,  2012),  but  they  also  show 
promising  perspectives  of  applications  in  the  environmental  sector  to  enhance  oil  recovery  in  oil-
producing wells (Liu et al., 2015; Joshi et al., 2016; Long et al., 2017; de Araujo et al., 2019; Alvarez 
et  al.,  2020;  Miyazaki  et  al.,  2020),  to  increase  the  biodegradation  rate  of  linear  and  aromatic 
hydrocarbons (Wang et al., 2020), and for metal removal from soil or aqueous solutions (Zouboulis et 
al., 2003; Eivazihollagh et al., 2019). Very recently, it was also suggested that surfactin can effectively 
demulsify waste crude oil (Yang et al., 2020). Their emulsifying property also confers them a potential 
of application in the food and cosmetics area for the product formulation (Mnif et al., 2013; Varvaresou 
et  al.,  2015;  Zouari  et  al.,  2016)  as  well  as  in  the  pharmaceutical  area for  the  formulation  of  stable 
microemulsion drug delivery systems (Ohadi et al., 2020). 
The variations in the molecular structure of the peptidic part and/or of the hydrocarbon chain greatly 
impact  their  physico-chemical  properties. In  term  of  self-aggregation  behavior,  the  critical  micellar 
concentration (CMC) value decreases with a longer fatty acid chain (CMC Surfactin C15 = 20 µM; 
CMC surfactin C14 = 65 µM; CMC surfactin C13 = 84 µM in Tris-HCl pH 8) (Deleu et al., 2003; Liu 
et al., 2015). It also decreases with the presence of a methyl ester on the Glu residue (Grangemard et 
al.,  2001)  or  the  replacing  of  the  Glu  residue  by  a  Gln  as  in  lichenysin  (Grangemard  et  al.,  2001; 
Bonmatin et al., 2003). On the contrary, the linearization of the peptide cycle (CMC linear surfactin

C14 = 374 µM in Tris pH 8.5) (Dufour et al., 2005) and the presence of a Leu4 instead of the Val4 as 
in pumilacidin (de Araujo et al., 2019) increase it. Different self-assembled nanostructures like sphere-
like micelles, wormlike micelles and unilamellar bilayers coexist with larger aggregates in aqueous 
solution depending on the surfactin concentration, pH, temperature, ionic strength and metal ions (Zou 
et al., 2010; Taira et al., 2017; Jahan et al., 2020). These parameters can induce conformational changes 
in the secondary structure of the cyclic peptide moiety and thereby affect the shape and the packing 
parameter of surfactin (Jahan et al., 2020). 
The  capacity  of  surface  tension  reducing is  also  influenced  by  the  molecular  structure  of  surfactin. 
Depending of environmental conditions, lichenysin is or not more efficient than surfactin to reduce the 
surface tension (in Tris pH 9.4 γcmc=35 and 37 for lichenysin and surfactin respectively and in NaHCO3 
pH  9.4  γcmc=30  and  29  for  lichenysin  and  surfactin  respectively)  (Grangemard  et  al.,  2001),  while 
pumilacidin is less (de Araujo et al., 2019). Linearization of the peptide cycle lessens this capacity (34 
mN/m in Tris pH 8.5). Nevertheless, the replacing of carboxyl group by a sulfo methylene amido group 
leads to a complete loss of activity (Bonmatin et al., 2003). The chain length but also the branching 
type also impact the surface tension. A longer chain is more efficient and the normal configuration is 
more active than the iso one which is more powerful than the anteiso (Yakimov et al., 1996). 
The effect of the chain length on the foaming properties does not follow this trend as it was shown that 
a lipidic chain with 14 carbon atoms provides surfactin with best foaming properties compared to that 
with 13 or 15 carbon atoms (Razafindralambo et al., 1998). 
Lichenysin  was  also  demonstrated  to  be  a  better  divalent  cation  chelating  agent  than  surfactin 
(Grangemard et al., 2001). This effect is assigned to an increase accessibility of the carboxyl group to 
the cation in the case of lichenysin (Habe et al., 2018). The complexation of divalent cations with the 
lipopeptide in a molar ratio of 2:1 for lichenysin leads to the formation of an intermolecular salt bridge, 
stronger than the intramolecular complexation in a 1:1 ratio with surfactin (Grangemard et al., 2001; 
Habe et al., 2018). 
Globally speaking, the few studies focused on the structure-properties relationships of surfactin family 
emphasize three main facts. The first is that the unique feature of the peptide loop provides surfactin 
with a fascinating molecular behavior at interfaces (Liu et al., 2020). Furthermore, the peptide cycle 
linearization leads to a structural distortion of the molecule reducing or annihilating its surface active 
power.  The  second  fact  is  that  the  surface  activity  of  surfactin  is  dictated  by  the  interplay  of 
hydrocarbon chain and peptide sequence (Liu et al., 2020). The more distant and distinct the polar and 
apolar domains are, the stronger the surface active power is. The last fact is that the charges of the polar 
part also play a primordial role in the physico-chemical properties. A monoanionic surfactin is more 
efficient than a dianionic one, due to a reduced repulsive effect between the molecules at the interface. 

The  remarkable  physico-chemical  properties  of  surfactin  are  also  responsible  for  their  biological  
activities which, in most of the cases, involve perturbation or disruption of membrane integrity. It was 
demonstrated for haemolytic (Kracht et al., 1999; Dufour et al., 2005), antibacterial (Bernheimer et al., 
1970), antiviral (Yuan et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2019) and antimycoplasma (Vollenbroich et al., 1997) 
activities of surfactin as well as its ability to inducing systemic resistance in plant (Ongena et al., 2007, 
2008). Some of those activities leading to promising results in the agricultural field (Chandler et al., 
2015; Loiseau et al., 2015). But surfactin was also characterized for anti-inflammation (Takahashi et

al.,  2006;  Zhao  et  al.,  2017),  anti-sepsis  (Hwang  et  al.,  2007),  anti-tumor  (Wu  et  al.,  2017)  and 
immunomodulatory (Park et al., 2009) activities for which another target than membranes is involved. 
A  synergistic  effect  has  been  observed  between  surfactin  and  other  lipopeptides.  The  addition  of 
surfactin  at  an  inactive  concentration  to  iturin  increase  its  haemolytic  activity  (Maget-Dana  et  al., 
1992). The  combination  of  surfactin  and fengycin  lead  to  a  decrease  in  disease  in  tomato  and  bean 
plants (Ongena et al., 2007). Furthermore, while surfactin has no effect against fungi, it has been shown 
to enhance the biological activities of other lipopeptides against fungi and oomycetes (Deravel et al., 
2014; Tanaka et al., 2015; Desmyttere et al., 2019).

4.2.Use of molecular modelling for mechanism of action investigation 
Molecular  modelling  methods  are  powerful  theoretical  tools  to  investigate  structure  functions 
relationship of surfactin and its mode of action. Docking and Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations 
have been used in various studies involving surfactin for the characterization of diverse properties to 
predict activities and domains of applications. 
For membrane interactions, Hypermatrix (Brasseur et al., 1987), was used to simulate the interaction 
of surfactin with a membrane monolayer in order to determine the lipid specificity for insertion and 
interacts  specifically  with  1,2-
membrane  destabilization. 
the  DPPC/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholin 
phosphocholine (DOPC) domain boundaries (Lins et al., 1995; Deleu et al., 2003, 2013). 
For medical applications, the interaction of surfactin with the amyloid  β -peptide (A β 42) has been 
studied with MD simulation and docking experiments (with GROMACS (Abraham et al., 2015) and 
AutoDock (Morris et al., 2009) respectively). 
Further investigations have shown that surfactin binds protofibrils by forming a stable hydrogen bond 
with residues involved in salt bridges responsible of amyloid aggregation and plaques stability (Verma 
et al., 2016). Another docking investigation, employing Swiss Dock (Lien Grosdidier et al., 2011), has 
shown that surfactin binds favorably via hydrogen bonds to porcine pancreatic lipase and inhibits its 
activity, which could lead to a novel and potent body weight reducer for obesity control (Meena et al., 
2018). 
Beside these investigations on monomeric surfactin interacting with potential targets, MD simulations 
proved to be an efficient tool to study  molecular assemblies. A surfactin monolayer at the air-water 
interface was studied under various interfacial concentrations. It was shown that packed structures are 
formed via intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, stabilizing the β-turn structure of the peptide 
ring, favouring the β-sheet domain organization and hydrophobic contacts between molecules Another 
simulation  was  applied  to  study  the  self-assembly  of  surfactin  in  water  and  more  particularly  the 
structural organization of the micelles (Lebecque et al., 2017). Micelles were pre-formed with PackMol 
(Martinez et al., 2009) and were simulated to analyse their behavior. The optimal aggregation number, 
i.e.20, predicted by this approach is in good agreement with the experimental values. Two parameters 
were analysed,  the hydrophilic (phi)/hydrophobic (pho) surface and the hydrophobic tail hydration 
(Lebecque et al., 2017). A higher phi/pho surface ratio means a more thermodynamically favorable 
organization  of  the  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic  domains,  but  steric  and/or  electrical  repulsions 
between polar heads have also to be considered. For surfactin, it was shown that the phi/pho surface 
ratio  undergoes  a  decrease  for  the  largest  micelles  of  surfactin  because  they  have  to  rearrange

themselves  to  reach  a  more  favorable  organization.  The  low  value  of  apolar  moieties  hydration 
observed  for  surfactin  micelles  is  due  to  the  very  large  peptidic  head  that  efficiently  preserves 
hydrophobic tails from contact with water. The Coarse Grain (CG) representation MARTINI (Marrink 
et al., 2007) (grouping atoms into beads to speed up the simulation process) was similarly applied to 
analyse  the  structural  properties  and  kinetics  of  surfactin  self-assembly  in  aqueous  solution  and  at 
octane/water interface (Gang et al., 2020). With complementary MD of a pre-formed micelle and a 
monolayer,  the  authors  showed  that  their  CG  model  is  in  agreement  with  atomistic  MD  and 
experimental data, for micelle self-assembly and stability, as well as for the monolayer. Furthermore, 
this study allows the development of a set of optimized parameters in a MARTINI CG model that could 
open further investigations for surfactin interaction with various biofilms, proteins or other targets of 
interest with a better sampling than atomistic MD. 

5.  Production 
This  last  part  of  this  review  is  dedicated  to  the  improvement  of  the  production  of  surfactin  like 
compounds. It will first consider the techniques for the identification and the quantification of these 
lipopeptides and then focus on strain, culture conditions and bioprocess optimization. Not to forget, 
the purification process allows for a greater recovery of the surfactin produced and lower the losses. 

5.1.Identification and quantification of surfactin and its variants 
In order to discover new natural variants or verify the production of synthetic ones, the identification 
is an important process. The first surfactin structure elucidation was made through hydrolysis of the 
peptide and fatty acid chain into fragments, their identification and alignment (Kakinuma, Sugino, et 
al., 1969). However, with the continuous innovations of analytical-chemical techniques such as mass 
spectrometry MS/MS (Yang, Li, et al., 2015), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Kowall et al., 1998) 
and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Fenibo et al., 2019), the analysis of new variants can 
be determined quicker and without hydrolysis. While FT-IR provides the functional groups, NMR leads 
to a complete structural characterization of the compounds but requires completely purified products 
at  the  level  of  mg  quantities.  Mass  spectrometry  does  not  enable  the  differentiation  of  compounds 
having the same mass (such as leucine and isoleucine for example), nor the type of fatty acid chain 
(linear, iso or anteiso), but provides the global mass and the peptide moiety primary sequence. 
An overview of surfactin’s dosage techniques can be found in Table 1. The first ones rely on surfactin´s 
amphiphilic nature, so that its production can be detected through its surfactant activity. 
Indirect methods, such as emulsification measure, haemolytic activity (blood agar plate) or cell surface 
hydrophobicity can be used. However, the correlation between those activities and surfactant activity 
has been refuted. Youssef et al. (Youssef et al., 2004) does not recommend the use of blood agar lysis 
as a screening method. Therefore, direct methods to measure the surface activity, such as interfacial 
tension measurement, drop shape analysis, drop collapse assay or oil spreading should be used (Youssef 
et  al.,  2004).  Newer  techniques  have  been  developed  the  last  few  years  for  a  rapid  detection  and 
quantification, based on colour shifts or fluorescence. 
The first colour shift approach is based on the higher affinity of a mediator, initially forming a complex 
with a colour indicator, for surfactin and thus the release of the colour indicator in the solution (Yang, 
Yu, et al., 2015). The fluorescence technique is based on the same principle, but with fluorescein instead

of  a  colour  indicator  (Heuson  et  al.,  2018).  This  leads  to  a  more  sensitive  and  stable  procedure. 
However,  another  colour  shift  approach  has  been  developed  based  only  on  the  interaction  between 
bromothymol blue solution and lipopeptides (Ong et al., 2018). However, since they are not specific 
for surfactin, the best and most sensitive quantification method is still the use of reversed phase HPLC-
UV  or  MS  (Geissler  et  al.,  2017). This  method  also  allows  the  discrimination  between  the  various 
homologues of the surfactin family. Indeed, the molecules are separated based on their hydrophobic 
properties, giving a shorter retention time for lipopeptides with a leucine in position 7 and a longer 
retention time for lipopeptides with a valine in position 7. The separation is also based on the fatty acid 
chain,  the  shorter  the  fatty  acid  chain  length  is,  the  shorter  the  elution  time  is  (Dhali,  2016). 
Furthermore,  the  production  capacity  of  a  micro-organism  can  be  discovered  through  PCR,  with 
primers  specific  to  the  surfactin  biosynthesis  genes  (sfp  and  srf)  (Mohammadipour  et  al.,  2009)  or 
genome sequencing. However, these methods do not reflect the real lipopeptide production, since only 
the presence of the genes is observed. RT-PCR allows the detection of the transcribed genes, but does 
not allow to reflect the post-transcriptional modifications. 

5.2.Optimisation of surfactin production 
In  order  to  enhance  the  surfactin  production,  in  addition  to  fermentation  optimization,  the  genetic 
engineering of the producing strains is of great significance. It was already covered in the past by other 
teams (Hu et al., 2019) and will be more developed here. 
A first strategy would be to allocate more resources of the cell to surfactin biosynthesis by suppressing 
different cellular processes. It was successful with the plipastatin operon disruption (Coutte, Leclère, 
et al., 2010) or biofilm formation related genes (Wu et al., 2019). However, a strain with a 10 % genome 
deletion,  comprising  genes  for  plipastin,  bacilysin,  toxins,  prophages  and  sporulation,  had  a  lower 
surfactin production (Geissler et al., 2019). Then, concerning surfactin production itself, the strategy 
can take place at different stages of the surfactin cell production: at the transcription level by promoter 
substitution  or  modification  of  the  transcriptional  regulatory  genes  of  srfA  operon,  at  the  level  of 
surfactin synthesis by increasing the precursor availability, during the molecule's excretion and finally 
during its degradation (Figure 5).  

5.2.1.  Transcription 
As seen before, surfactin NRPS is coded by four genes,  srfA-A, srfA-B, srfA-C and srfA-D, that are 
controlled by the Psrf antoinducible promoter, triggered by signal molecules from a quorum sensing 
pathway. Studies were performed to exchange this promoter with inducer-specific or constitutive ones. 
It emerged that a replacement with a constitutive promoter in a weak surfactin producer strain leads to 
an increase in the production, but that the opposite effect is observed for strong surfactin producers 
(Willenbacher et al., 2016). However, the use of novel artificial inducible promoters leads to an increase 
in surfactin production of more than 17 times (Jiao et al., 2017). 
In addition to the promoter, transcriptional regulatory genes also control the expression of the NRPS 
genes. The cell density dependent quorum sensing system plays a regulatory role in many pathways in 
Bacillus, and among others in the regulation of the srfA operon. Ohsawa et al. (Ohsawa et al., 2006) 
showed that the inhibition of the ComQXP quorum sensing locus lead to a decrease in the expression

of srfA genes and Jung et al. (Jung et al., 2012) showed that the overexpression of ComX and PhrC 
increases the production of surfactin. 
In addition to the quorum sensing system itself, regulators also impact the  srfA operon, the quorum 
sensing system or even other mechanisms that indirectly impact surfactin. There are positive regulators 
such as PerR (Hayashi et al., 2005) and negative regulators such as CodY (Coutte et al., 2015), Rap 
(Hayashi et al., 2006), SinI (López et al., 2009) and Spx (Zhang et al., 2006).  

5.2.2.  Increasing precursor supply of NRPS by feeding or metabolic engineering 
Modifying media and fermentation condition is a strategy to overproduce the lipopeptide precursors as 
well as to favor the production of certain isoforms. For example it was seen that the feeding of leucine 
as 50% of the nitrogen source lead to an increase in specific surfactin production of three times (Coutte 
et al., 2015).   Another strategy is the application of rational metabolic engineering approaches such 
as: (i) blocking competitive pathways for building blocks, as well as, those pathways that consume 
products; (ii) pulling flux through biosynthetic pathways by removing regulatory signals; and (iii) by 
overexpressing rate-limiting enzymes. 

5.2.2.1.Amino acids precursors 
One way to develop this metabolic engineering approach is to use knockout of genes which negatively 
influence the intracellular pool of amino acids precursors. To implement the knock-out of gene which 
negatively influence the intracellular pool of amino acid precursor, their metabolic pathways have to 
be modelled as a reaction network taking into account the regulation processes. 
Firstly, the various pathways involved in the metabolites needed for the amino acid production should 
be  addressed.  In  this  research  for  compounds  from  the  glycolysis  that  influence  the  amino  acid 
production, pyruvate is interesting from multiple points of view. It is the entry point of the Krebs cycle 
through its conversion into acetyl-CoA, but it is also used as a substrate for the production of amino 
acids that compose the surfactin. Indeed, pyruvate is converted into valine and leucine. Furthermore, 
the production of isoleucine is made through threonine and pyruvate. The Krebs cycle also contributes 
to the amino acid production,  with oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate, they belong to the metabolism of 
aspartic and glutamic acid. Secondly, the various enzymes that regulates metabolite production should 
be addressed. The search can also go a level above, with the regulators and promoters of those enzymes, 
such as pleiotropic regulators CodY or TnrA (Dhali, 2016). Lastly, the transporters of the amino acid 
precursors  can  be  addressed.  Indeed,  the  amino  acid  can  be  transported  into  the  cell  from  the 
environment. 
Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2019), showed that the knockout of murC, yrpC and racE, negative regulators 
involved in the metabolism of glutamate, lead to an increase in surfactin production. The choice of 
those knock-outs can also be directed by methods from computational biology, to narrow them down 
and reduce the laboratory time needed. 
Some prediction methods are based on formal reasoning techniques based on abstract-interpretation 
(Niehren et al., 2016). This is a general framework for abstracting formal models that is widely used 
in  the  static  analysis  of  programming  languages.  Formal  models  are  reaction  networks  with  partial 
kinetic  information  with  steady  state  semantics  define  systems  of  linear  equations,  with  kinetic 
constraints, that are then abstracted. Here, the methods were to be developed further, so that they could

be applied to reaction networks rather than other kinds of programs. This approach has been used for 
the  branched  chain  amino  acids  (leucine,  valine  and  isoleucine)  that  mainly  compose  the  surfactin 
peptide chain (Coutte et al., 2015). 
The  quite  complex  metabolic  pathway  of  leucine  production  from  threonine  and  pyruvate  was 
modelled,  by  rewriting  the  informal  model  from  SubtiWiki  (Coutte  et  al.,  2015)  into  this  formal 
modelling language, while adding and adapting some reactions. It selected gene knock-outs that may 
lead to leucine overproduction, for which some of them an increase in surfactin production in Bacillus 
subtilis 168 was observed after experimental verification (Dhali et al., 2017). 
Since single gene deletion is successful, multiple gene deletion must be the next aim. To be able to 
perform various deletions and/or insertions in the same strain, a markerless strategy is required. Various 
strategies can be performed such as temperature sensitive plasmid, pORI vectors, auxotrophy based 
methods, but also the cre/lox system (Yan et al., 2008), the pop-in pop-out technique (Tanaka et al., 
2013) and the CRISPRi technology (Wang et al., 2019). 

5.2.2.2.Fatty acid precursors 
As mentioned, fatty acids are one of the crucial components of surfactin, and modifications of this part 
of  the  molecule,  such  as  length  and  isomerism,  demonstrated  to  impact  on  the  physicochemical 
properties  and  on  the  biological  activity  of  lipopeptides  (Dufour  et  al.,  2005;  De  Faria  et  al., 2011; 
Henry et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015; Dhali et al., 2017). Different metabolic engineering strategies were 
applied to improve surfactin production, in terms of the branched-chain fatty acid supply included: (i) 
enhancing the branched-chain α-ketoacyl-CoA supply (Dhali et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 
2019); (ii) enhancing malonyl-ACP synthesis (Wu et al., 2019); (iii) overexpressing the whole fatty 
acid synthase complex (Wu et al., 2019); and (iv) pulling substrates flux towards surfactin biosynthesis 
by enhancing srfA transcription (Jiao et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). 
Another study showed that the overexpression of the bkd operon produces less surfactin, besides being 
detrimental  for  cell  growth  (Wu  et  al.,  2019).  As  the  BKD  complex  requires  lipoylation  for  its 
dehydrogenase activity, this enzyme competes with other lipoic acid dependent complexes (pyruvate 
dehydrogenase  complex  (PDH),  2-oxoacid  dehydrogenase,  acetoin  dehydrogenase  and  the  glycine 
cleavage system), generating a suppression of cell growth and, eventually, of surfactin production. By 
overexpressing the enzymes responsible for lipoic acid synthesis (lipA, lipL and lipM) (Christensen et 
al., 2011; Martin et al., 2011), this suppressive effect is reversed. The competitive lipoylation process 
between  BKD  and  other  lipoic  acid  dependent  complexes  is  eliminated  (Wu  et  al.,  2019)  and  thus 
generates a higher production of surfactin with respect to the parental strain. 
A  further  pathway,  targeted  to  modification,  represents  the  malonyl-ACP  synthesis. Acetyl-CoA  is 
converted into malonyl-CoA through the activity of ACC (accDABC). Thus, overexpression of these 
genes  in  combination  with  that  of  fabD,  the  malonyl-CoA:ACP  transacylase,  has  been  reported  to 
increase  the  levels  of  surfactin  production  (Wu  et  al.,  2019).  Furthermore,  these  authors  applied 
systematic metabolic engineering in B. subtilis 168 to construct surfactin hyperproducer strains. Other 
successful  interventions  related  to  FA  biosynthesis  have  also  been  described.  The  simultaneous 
overexpression  of  most  FAS  II  coding  genes;  fabH  and  fabGZIF  (Runguphan  et  al.,  2014)  and 
expression  of  the  E.  coli  tesA  thioesterase  (Steen  et  al.,  2010),  to  “pull”  through  the  pathway. The

combination  of  the  mentioned  interventions,  in  an  already  modified  B.  subtilis  168  chassis,  further 
improved surfactin production by 220% (Wu et al., 2019). 
Acetyl-CoA, is a key intermediate metabolite, which is not only used for surfactin biosynthesis, but 
fundamentally  for  cell  growth  and  proliferation. Acetyl-CoA  is  generated  from  pyruvate  by  PDH; 
overexpression  of  enzymes  of  the  glycolytic  pathway  and  the  KO  of  genes  coding  for  enzymes 
associated with the acetyl-CoA consumption are common strategies to increase the supply of this key 
intermediate.  Wu  et  al. (Wu  et  al.,  2019)  showed  that  the  simultaneous  overexpression  of  the  PDH 
genes and that of the glycolysis enzymes produce an increase in biomass but not a significant increase 
in 
the 
overexpression/deregulation of the srf gene cluster, the surfactin production could be further improved 
to 12.8 g/l, achieving a 42% (mmol surfactin/mol sucrose) of the theoretical yield.

5.2.2.3.Directed biosynthesis of surfactin 
Due to the non-specificity of some adenylation domains, the proportion of natural variants of surfactin 
can  be  modified  through  the  feeding  of  certain  amino  acids  as  the  nitrogen  source  in  the  culture 
medium. In the peptide moiety, this only affects L amino acid residues located in position 2, 4 and 7, 
and with a greater variation in position 4. Indeed, the feeding of valine leads to an increase of valine in 
position 7 (Menkhaus et al., 1993), the feeding of isoleucine (Ile) leads to the apparition of isoleucine 
in position 2 and/or 4 (Grangemard et al., 1997) and the feeding of alanine (Ala) lead to a surfactin 
with  alanine  in  position  4  (Peypoux  et  al.,  1994). Also,  the  culture  medium  can  also  influence  the 
proportion of surfactin variants with different acyl moieties. For example, Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2015) 
found  that  the  strain  B.  subtilis  BS-37  has  lower  surfactin  titers  with  higher  proportions  of  C15-
surfactin when grown in LB compared with glucose medium. Another team analysed the influence of 
amino acid residues on the pattern of surfactin variants produced by B. subtilis TD7 (Liu et al., 2012). 
The β-hydroxy fatty acid in surfactin variants was C15>C14>C13>C16, when no amino acid was added 
in the culture medium. On the other hand, when Arg, Gln, or Val was added to the culture medium, the 
proportion  of  surfactins  with  even  β-hydroxy  fatty  acid  chain  significantly  increased;  whereas  the 
addition of Cys, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Ser, or Thr significantly enhanced the proportion of surfactins with 
odd  β-hydroxy  fatty  acid.  Some  of  these  results  can  be  explained  by  the  mode  of  biosynthesis  of 
branched fatty acids, the precursors of which are branched chain amino acids (Kaneda, 1991). Thus, 
valine feeding enhances the proportion of iso variants with even fatty acid chains, while leucine and 
isoleucine feeding enhances the proportion of uneven iso or anteiso fatty acids chains respectively (Liu 
et al., 2012). 
Modification of the variant pattern can also be obtained by genetic engineering of precursor pathways. 
As previously mentioned, increasing the branched chain 2-ketoacyl-CoAs intermediates is one of the 
strategies used for enhancing the synthesis of surfactin. The deletion of gene  codY, which encodes a 
global transcriptional regulator and negatively regulates the bkd operon lead to a 5.8-fold increase in 
surfactin production in B. subtilis BBG258 with an increase by a factor 1.4 of the amino acid valine in 
position 7 instead of leucine (Dhali et al., 2017). On the other hand, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2019), 
using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology, were able to repress the bkdAA and bkdAB genes 
of the bkd operon; provoking a modest improvement in surfactin concentration, but a significant change 
in  the  proportion  of  the  nC14  component.  Similar  results  were  observed  in  B.  subtilis  BBG261,  a

derivative  lpdV  mutant  strain,  where  the  interruption  of  this  2-oxoisovalerate  dehydrogenase  of the 
BKD complex led to higher percentage of the nC14 isoform (52,7% in the lpdV mutant in comparison 
with the 21,2% of the control strain) (Dhali et al., 2017). 

5.2.3.  Excretion 
The  excretion  of  surfactin  is  another  important  step  for  its  overproduction.  Even  if,  as  mentioned 
before, surfactin can insert itself in the membrane of the cell, the transmembrane efflux is mediated by 
protein transporters. 
As mentioned before, thanks to its amphiphilic structure, surfactin can interact with the membrane of 
the cell. Under or at the CMC, the surfactin can insert itself in the membrane, and above the CMC it 
can even solubilize it (Deleu et al., 2003, 2013). However, it was hypothesised by Tsuge et al. that the 
gene yerP, homolog to the RND family efflux pumps, is involved in the surfactin efflux (Tsuge et al., 
2001). Later, Li et al. (Li et al., 2015) showed that the overexpression of three lipopeptide transporters, 
dependent on proton motive force, YcxA, KrsE and YerP lead to an increase in surfactin export of 89%, 
52% and 145% respectively. 
Those studies are promising and the efflux proteins need to be further investigated to fully understand 
the excretion of surfactin. 

5.2.4.  Degradation 
Lastly, the importance of surfactin degradation should not be underestimated. Indeed, a decrease in 
surfactin concentration of 59% and 73% has been observed during the fermentation process (Nitschke 
et  al.,  2004;  Maass  et  al.,  2016),  leading  to  the  presence  of  degradation  mechanisms  by  the  cell 
themselves. 
Three  hypotheses  are  considered  by the  different teams  observing  this  phenomenon.  Since  that,  for 
different mediums with the same carbon content, the surfactin decrease happened at the same time, it 
could  be  that  surfactin  is  used  as  a  carbon  source  after  glucose  depletion.  Or,  since  the  decrease 
happened at the same surfactin concentration, that it is degraded because of its possible inhibitory effect 
at higher concentration (Maass et al., 2016). It was also shown that the surfactin decrease is linked to 
the  increase  in  protease  activity  in  the  culture  medium  and  thus  the  produced  enzymes  could  be 
involved in this degradation (Nitschke et al., 2004). 
As for the excretion, this degradation process was seldomly researched but could greatly influence the 
surfactin production. 

5.3.Culture medium and conditions 
Landy culture medium, based on glucose and glutamic acid, is one the main culture medium usually 
used for surfactin production. Furthermore, some studies have been performed to ameliorate it (Jacques 
et al., 1999; Akpa et al., 2001; Wei et al., 2007; Ghribi et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015; Willenbacher et 
al., 2015). 
However, another type of approach for the culture medium is rising. Indeed, the use of cheap substrate 
such as waste or by-products from the agro-industrial field is more and more researched (De Faria et 
al.,  2011;  Gudiña  et  al.,  2015;  Moya  Ramírez  et  al.,  2015;  Paraszkiewicz  et  al.,  2018),  since  this

approach enables a sustainable production of surfactins. The recent review of Zanotto et al. develops 
specifically this approach (Zanotto et al., 2019). 
Concerning the fundamental parameters of culture condition, a pH of 7 and a temperature of 37°C leads 
to a higher production rate (Ohno et al., 1995a). However, when up-scaling from a flask culture to a 
larger  scale,  the  main  challenge  in  surfactin  production  appears.  Indeed,  the  agitation  rate  and 
oxygenation of the culture medium play an important role in the production (Hbid et al., 1996; Guez 
et al., 2008; Ghribi et al., 2011). As surfactin is a surfactant and thus increases the stability of a gas-
liquid  dispersion,  this  agitation  leads  to  the  abundant  production  of  foam.  Nonetheless,  even  if  this 
foam production is often considered as a drawback, it can be used with the appropriate reactors as an 
advantage to easily recover surfactin. 

5.4.Production processes 
For  an  overproduction  of  surfactin,  the  addition  of  a  solid  carrier  to  an  agitated  liquid  culture  can 
enhance surfactin production by stimulating cell growth and by promoting a biofilm formation. Yeh et 
al. (Yeh et al., 2005) added activated carbon, agar and expanded clay, observing a 36 times increase 
with activated carbon. 
Nonetheless, as mentioned before, due to the high foam generation in surfactin production, classical 
stirred reactors are not optimal for this bioprocess. Indeed, adding antifoam to the culture medium has 
many drawbacks. Antifoams may have a negative effect on cell growth and are costly, but even more, 
they have to be eliminated during purification. Thus, multiple strategies can be applied: (i) to use this 
foam production to its advantage or (ii) to reduce or avoid foam production. 
For the first strategy, the foam fractionation method consists in a continuous removal of the foam from 
a  liquid  agitated  culture  to  a  sterile  vessel.  So,  this  removal  is  a  first  purification  step  and  by  the 
continuous extraction avoids any possible feedback inhibition from the products (Cooper et al., 1981; 
Davis et al., 2001). However, the foam can carry a part of the culture medium and cells out and thus 
decrease the production. For the second strategy, a rotating disk bioreactor was used by Chtioui et al. 
(Chtioui  et  al.,  2012)  where  a  biofilm formation occurs  on  a rotating  disk  in  a  liquid  medium. The 
process is simple and can easily be upscaled, but the oxygen transfer is quite low and thus not optimal 
for surfactin production. 
Bacillus biofilm formation capacity can also be used in other type of biofilm reactors such as packed 
bed reactors, where the liquid medium recirculates on a packing in the reactor (Zune et al., 2016). The 
purification is easily performed, but the biofilm growth is difficult to control because it depends on the 
liquid  distribution  in  the  packing.  Recent  studies  have  considered  the  genetic  engineering  of  the 
bacterial cells to modify their biofilm formation ability or their filamentous growth in order to enhance 
their adhesion on the packing (Brück et al., 2019, 2020). 
A membrane reactor allows for a bubbleless oxygen transfer through a membrane between the air and 
the  culture  medium.  Furthermore,  a  first  surfactin  purification  can  be  made  through  ultrafiltration 
coupled to the fermentation (Coutte, Lecouturier, et al., 2010). However, there is a surfactin adsorption 
on the membrane and they can be costly when upscaled. 
Lastly, a solid medium can be used with solid state fermentation that avoids the mechanical stirring of 
liquid cultures and thus the foam production. It represents a simple process but with parameters more

difficult  to  control  than  in  a  liquid  culture.  However,  many  waste  and  by-products  used  as  novel 
substrate are in a solid state and could thus be used without pretreatment (Ohno et al., 1995b). 
Most studies are performed on the enhancement of one of the steps of the production process, but some 
studies are performed to decrease the costs in a large scale production (Czinkóczky et al., 2020). 

5.5.Purification 
The purification process is a major step in the surfactin production and depends on the fermentation 
process  used.  Linked  to  the  techniques  mentioned  before,  foam  can  be  recovered  during  the 
fermentation  and  lead  to  70  %  of  recovery  (Davis  et  al.,  2001;  Willenbacher  et  al.,  2014).  For  a 
fermentation process with the surfactin in the liquid medium, acid precipitation, linked to the negative 
charge of surfactin, is the oldest and more common used technique. It can lead to a high recovery rate, 
but  has  a  low  purity  (55  %)  and  is  the  only  technique  that  cannot  be  continuously  coupled  to  the 
production. Solvent extraction can also be used alone but it is mostly coupled with acid precipitation 
to  enhance  the  purity  (Kim  et  al.,  1997;  Geissler  et  al.,  2017).  One  of  the  most  common  type  of 
purification,  membrane  filtration,  can  especially  be  used  for  surfactin  through  its  micelle  forming 
ability  above  its  critical  micelle  concentration.  The  aggregated  molecule  is  larger  an  thus  can  be 
retained by membranes with a MWCO of 10 to 100 kDa (Jauregi et al., 2013) with recovery rates and 
a  purity  above  90  %  depending  on  the  applied  membrane.  Furthermore,  hybrid methods  have  been 
successfully  employed,  i.e.  precipitation  before  filtration  (Chen  et  al.,  2007),  which  facilitated  the 
process or increased the final purity. 
The  techniques  mentioned  above  are  mostly  used  for  the  extraction  of  surfactin  from  the  culture 
medium.  Some  uses  of  surfactin  require  a  higher  purity  that  can  be  obtained  with  the  following 
methods. The physico-chemical properties of surfactin can be used through its adsorption on resin or 
active  charcoal  (Liu  et  al.,  2007),  leading  to  variable  recovery  rates  and  purity.  Chromatographic 
derived methods can also be used to get a better purity and to separate individual variants or isoforms 
of  the  lipopeptide  (Smyth  et  al.,  2010).  Reverse  phase  chromatography,  based  on  hydrophobic 
interactions, is the most common technique employed. 

6.  Conclusions 
With the improved genetic toolbox which is now available, a larger and more diverse chemical space 
of the surfactin scaffold can be generated and explored.  This endeavour will create novel surfactin 
derivatives with improved, specialized or expanded biological activities. And even if this molecule’s 
potential  applications  range  is  already  broad  and  reaches  different  industrials  sectors,  it  may  be 
enhanced with those novel compounds. However, despite the advancements in surfactin production, its 
production cost is still withholding it for a widespread commercial use in low added-value applications.

Figure 2: Biochemical steps for the formation of fatty acid and their channeling to surfactin 

biosynthesis. The first step of fatty acid synthesis involves the production of malonyl-CoA by the 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex (ACC). The malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase, FadD, transfers 
the malonyl groups to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to produce malonyl-ACP. FabH, 
condensates the malonyl-ACP and a priming acyl-CoA substrate to produce the first new C-C 
bond. The  keto group of the -ketoacyl-ACP is completely reduced by the reducing enzymes of 
the cycle, FabG, FabZ, FabI,  and then the condensing enzyme FabF initiates a new round of 
elongation of the growing carbon chain utilizing malonyl-ACP. The acyl-ACP product is 
primarily channeled to PL biosynthesis or alternatively to surfactin biosynthesis. For this, at 
least two additional biochemical steps are required, a hydroxylation of a free FA by YbdT and 
its activation by an ACS. 

Figure 3 : Natural and synthetic variants of surfactin. The natural variants can be obtained through 
specific strains, the non specificity of the adenylation domain or the first condensation domain, 
a non cyclization or a linearization and through the genetic engineering of the NRPS. The

synthetic variants can be obtained through a chemical modification of a natural product or 
through total chemical synthesis. The first three molecule naturally produced are surfactin 
produced by B. subtilis and others, pumilacidin from B.  pumilus and lichenysin from B. 
licheniformis.

subdomains. The new module definition CA-A-T-CD is indicated in light green. BOTTOM: 
Examples of biobrick-like exchanges and deletions using a synthetic biology concept. The 
resultant changes in the molecule are indicated in red. R represents the rest of the fatty acid 
moiety, which has numerous possibilities regarding chain length, degree of saturation and 
branching.
