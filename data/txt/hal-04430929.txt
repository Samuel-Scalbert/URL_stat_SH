Abstract

Human activities have a growing impact on global biodiversity. While our understanding of
biodiversity worldwide is not yet comprehensive, it is crucial to explore effective means of
characterizing it in order to mitigate these impacts. The advancements in data storage,
exchange capabilities, and the increasing availability of extensive taxonomic, ecological,
and environmental databases offer possibilities for implementing new approaches that can
address knowledge gaps regarding species and habitats. This enhanced knowledge will, in
turn,   facilitate   improved   management   practices   and   enable   better   local   governance   of

territories. Meeting these requirements necessitates the development of innovative tools
and methods to respond to these needs.

Citizen   science   platforms   have   emerged   as   valuable   resources   for   generating   large
amounts   of   biodiversity   data,   thanks   to   their   visibility   and   attractiveness   to   individuals
involved   in   territorial   management   and   education.   These   platforms   present   new
opportunities to train deep learning models for automated species recognition, leveraging
the   substantial   volumes   of   multimedia   data   they   accumulate.   However,   effectively
managing, curating, and disseminating the data and services generated by these platforms
remains a significant challenge that hinders the achievement of their objectives. In line with
this,   the   GUARDEN  and   MAMBO  European   projects   aim   to   utilize   the   Pl@ntNet
participatory   science   platform   (Affouard   et   al.   2021)   to   develop   and   implement   novel
computational services to enable the widespread creation of floristic inventories.

In   the   pursuit   of   this   project,   various   standards   and   reference   datasets   have   been
employed,   such   as   the   POWO  (Plants   of   the   World   Online)   world   checklist   and   the
WGSRPD  (World   Geographical   Scheme   for   Recording   Plant   Distributions)   standard,   to
establish a foundation for creating a global service that aids in plant identification through
visual   analysis.   This   service   relies   on   a   NoSQL   (Not   Only   Structured   Query
Language) data management system ArangoDB (Arango Database), utilizes state-of-the-
art   automated   visual   classification   models   (vision   transformers),   and   operates   on   a
distributed   IT   (Information   Technology) infrastructure   that   leverages   the   capabilities   of
collaborative stakeholders interested in supporting this initiative.

Global-scale   automated   workflows   have   been   established   specifically   for   the   collection,
analysis, and dissemination of illustrated occurrences of plant species. These workflows
now enable the development of new IT tools that facilitate the description and monitoring of
species and habitat conservation statuses. A comprehensive presentation highlighting the
significant advancements achieved will be provided to share the lessons learned during its
development   and   ensure   the   widespread   adoption   of   this   service   within   the   scientific
community.
