This article describes our study on the alignment of two complementary
knowledge graphs useful
in agriculture: the thesaurus of cultivated plants in
France named French Crop Usage (FCU) and the French national taxonomic
repository TAXREF for fauna, ﬂora, and fungi. FCU describes the usages of plants
in agriculture: “tomatoes” are crops used for human food, and “grapevines” are
crops used for human beverage. TAXREF describes biological taxa and associated
scientiﬁc names: for example, a tomato species may be “Solanum lycopersicum”
or a grapevine species may be “Vitis vinifera”. Both knowledge graphs contain
vernacular names of plants but those names are ambiguous. Thus, a group of
agricultural experts produced some mappings from FCU crops to TAXREF taxa.
Moreover, new RDF properties have been deﬁned to declare those new types of
mapping relations between plant descriptions. The metadata for the mappings and
the mapping set are encoded with the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological
Mappings (SSSOM), a new model which, among other qualities, offers means to
report on provenance of particular interest for this study. The produced mappings
are available for download in Recherche Data Gouv, the federated national
platform for research data in France.

1. Introduction

While the Web of linked data makes more and more knowledge graphs available,
their cross-use often remains a challenge. This study presents a dataset containing
mappings between two knowledge graphs representing diﬀerent points of view on the
same objects. This mapping set should allow to query simultaneously these graphs
to enrich object descriptions by combining these points of view. Agriculture oﬀers
a particular use case of mappings,
linked to the modeling of cultivated plants.
Several expertises are needed to describe a cultivated plant: farmer vs. agronomist,
agronomist vs. ecologist. The scientiﬁc world (ecologists or agronomists) tends to
use scientiﬁc names from taxonomic science to designate living organisms (plants,
insects). These scientiﬁc names are stored in biological taxonomies. The world of users
(farmers) generally uses vernacular names or domain speciﬁc categories (e.g., cereals)

to designate the living organisms involved in their practice. In
parallel, a plant can have several usages in agriculture: (1) plants
cultivated in a plot for production purposes such as vegetables or
cereals, in other word crops, (2) weeds that appear on a plot without
being cultivated for which farmers want to limit the development or
remove them from the plot, (3) a ﬁrst cultivated plant that provides
a service to a second cultivated plant for production purposes. Both
plants are cultivated on the same plot but sometime not at the
same time. The ﬁrst cultivated plant will be destroyed without being
harvested and is called service plant. The second cultivated plant
will be harvested and is called the crop. For reasons of conciseness,
we will limit this article to the plant usages for production purposes
that is to say crops.

We present our study on the mappings of two complementary
knowledge graphs useful in the agricultural domain: the French
Crop Usage thesaurus (FCU) and the French national taxonomic
register TAXREF for fauna, ﬂora, and fungi. FCU describes the
usage of plants in agriculture: “tomatoes” are crops used for human
food, “grapevines” are crops used for human food or beverage. It
represents the farmers’ point of view. TAXREF describes biological
taxa and associated scientiﬁc names: for example, a tomato species
may be “Solanum lycopersicum” or a grapevine species may be “Vitis
vinifera”. TAXREF represents the agronomists’ point of view. Both
knowledge graphs contain vernacular names of plants. Vernacular
names are often ambiguous and not consensual, which renders the
matching activity particularly challenging.

Our previous studies (Michel et al., 2022) have implemented
several automatic alignment methods based on vernacular names
comparison. Those automatic methods reused existing reference
sources such as EPPO global database1 and the oﬃcial French
catalog of species and varieties of cultivated plants GEVES.2
The results show that it is necessary to clean the automatically
produced alignments due to the ambiguity of vernacular names.
Therefore, a group of agricultural experts has produced a set of
valid mappings. Those mappings are published as open data on the
French Recherche Data Gouv repository.3 Thus, they could be used
as a gold standard to validate any automatic alignment methods.

The remainder of the study is organized as follows: Section
2 describes ﬁrst the knowledge graphs and vocabularies used in
our mapping set (Section 2.1), followed by the manual method
applied to align the two knowledge graphs (Section 2.2). Section 3
presents our analysis of the challenge encountered in matching the
graphs and representing the mapping set using the SSSOM model.
In Section 4, we summarize the results and provide an outlook for
future improvement.

2. Methods

2.1. Materials

First, we describe in detail the two aligned knowledge graphs:
TAXREF-LD and FCU. Second we present the RDF vocabulary

accessible at https://www.geves.fr/catalogue/.

that we deﬁned to declare new types of mapping relations between
plant descriptions. Indeed, SKOS properties are not suﬃcient to
align an agricultural usage with a scientiﬁc taxon. Third, the
SSSOM vocabulary is presented to store the set of mappings and
their metadata.

2.1.1. TAXREF and TAXREF-LD

TAXREF (Gargominy et al., 2021) is the French taxonomic
repository for fauna, ﬂora, and fungi. In addition to a Web portal,
a REST service, and a set of downloadable CSV ﬁles, TAXREF is
available in the form of a knowledge graph complying with the
Linked Data principles, named TAXREF-LD (Michel et al., 2017).
TAXREF-LD is available on the AgroPortal repository.4 This study
has been developed using the 15.2 version of TAXREF-LD which
contains 287,229 classes and more than 1,000,000 instances.

To accurately reﬂect the distinction between taxonomy (a taxon
gathers biological individuals that share common characteristics)
and nomenclature (the scientiﬁc names assigned to taxa), TAXREF-
LD has two distinct levels of modeling, as shown in Figure 1.
At the taxonomic level, each taxon is modeled as an OWL class
whose members are the biological individuals of that taxon. The
parent class is the higher ranked taxon (e.g., “Daucus carota” is of
rank species, the parent class “Daucus” is of rank genus). At the
nomenclatural level, scientiﬁc names are represented as concepts in
a SKOS thesaurus. Each name (instance of skos:Concept) is linked
to a taxon (an OWL class) by a property indicating whether it is
the reference name (accepted name in zoology or valid name in
botany) or a synonym. The ﬁgure also presents vernacular names
that are represented as a simple literal as well as a blank node of type
skos-xl:Label that reiﬁes the vernacular name and makes it possible
to provide additional information such as the geographic area in
which this vernacular name is valid or a bibliographic reference.
In addition to strictly taxonomic information, TAXREF-LD also
represents other types of information not shown on this ﬁgure, such
as habitats, conservation status, biogeographical status, interactions
between species, and the bibliographical references associated with
this information. Notably, TAXREF-LD sometimes associates the
same vernacular name with several taxa. These vernacular names
are taken from the publications where the scientiﬁc names are
declared. Furthermore, TAXREF-LD is linked to several third-party
taxonomic repositories including Agrovoc Thesaurus and NCBI
Organismal Taxonomy.

2.1.2. French Crop Usage thesaurus

The French Crop Usage (FCU) thesaurus normalizes crop
names in French. Moreover, it organizes these crop names in
categories, according to their usages on the French territory. The
usages represent also the agricultural sectors.

As shown in Figure 2,

the thesaurus hierarchy has two
main branches. The branch named “Multiusages” contains all
the cultivated plants that have several usages in agriculture. For
example, “carotte” (carrot) may be used as vegetable or fodder.
The branch “Usages_plantes_cultivees” organizes cultivated plants
according to their usages and represents agricultural sectors. In this

branch, the crop usage “carotte potagère” is linked to the vegetable
category “légume racine” (root vegetable).

The FCU thesaurus is formalized using the Simple Knowledge
Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary proposed by W3C (Miles
and Bechhofer, 2009). Each crop usage or category is represented
by an instance of skos:Concept. The thesaurus is published on the
Web using Linked Data principles.

The thesaurus is available on the AgroPortal repository.5 This
study has been developed using the 3.3 version of FCU which
contains 707 instances of skos:Concept. The maximum depth of
the hierarchy is 6 levels. Each skos:Concept is deﬁned by several
properties, as shown in Figure 3. The description of a crop usage
or category contains the following:

• The value of property skos:prefLabel is the crop name in
French. The term is the vernacular name of the cultivated
plant or the category name. To avoid ambiguity in the case
of a cultivated plant with diﬀerent usages, the crop name is
the combination of the vernacular name of the plant and its
usage. For example, in Figure 3, the crop name is “carotte” +
“potagère”.

• The value of property skos:altLabel is other possible labels
that can be used for the crop. For example, in Figure 3, an
alternative crop name is “carotte cultivée”.

• The value of property skos:deﬁnition is the deﬁnition of the
crop usage in French. The deﬁnition accounts for the crop
position in the hierarchy.

• The value of property skos:note is at least one deﬁnition from
another source, such as the French Wikipedia. The deﬁnition
always ends by the indication of the source. For example, in
Figure 3, the crop “carotte potagère” was found in The Oﬃcial
Catalog of Species and Varieties of Cultivated Crops in France.6
Thus, depending on the source, the same crop may have
diﬀerent names which show the ambiguity of crop names.

2.1.3. Mapping properties: taxon vs. usage

In TAXREF-LD, a taxon is deﬁned by an OWL class, and the
names of taxon are deﬁned by instances of skos:Concept. In FCU, a
crop usage is deﬁned by an instance of skos:Concept.

We have deﬁned 10 annotation properties to link an OWL class
representing a taxon to an instance of skos:Concept representing a
crop usage. The main annotation property is ontofcu:hasTaxon (/
its inverse property is ontofcu:hasUsage). This property (/ its inverse
property) links a crop usage to a taxon. This relation indicates that
the taxon is a candidate to fulﬁll the crop usage. For example, the
species “Daucus Carota” can be used as “carotte fourragère” (fodder

species “Daucus Carota” is one of the reference taxa used as
“carotte potagère” (vegetable carrot). The subspecies “Daucus
carota subsp. sativus” is another reference taxon to be used as
“carotte potagère” (vegetable carrot).

annotation property represents a relationship from a crop
usage to a taxon. This relation indicates that one of the
descendants of the crop usage is the reference usage of the

usage “tomate cerise” (cherry tomato). Unfortunately, this type
of tomato is not deﬁned in FCU. Thus, the mapping between

We have deﬁned 12 object properties to link an instance

(sugarloaf chicory). Unfortunately, this form does not appear
in TAXREF-LD. Its parent, the variety “Cichorium intybus

2.1.4. Alignment metadata model SSSOM

Simple standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) is
a recent standard model developed by the biomedical community
around OBO Foundry and described by Matentzoglu et al. (2022).
It provides a rich set of metadata to describe mappings (individual
mappings between a pair of entities) and a mapping set (a set of
individual mappings). For this work, we used SSSOM version 0.15
that was released in July 2023.

The main objective of the SSSOM project is to propose
a catalog of metadata allowing to have information about
the provenance of the mappings, whether they are calculated
manually or automatically. The expected impact is an augmented
trustworthiness resulting in an increased reuse of mappings by
third parties. Meanwhile, there is also a real desire to produce a
model that is easy to use. Indeed, the project proposes, on the
one hand, the serialization in RDF/OWL for the Semantic Web
community and, on the other hand, a TSV format for a larger
community which can thus exchange mappings in a simple format
yet with rich semantics.

We chose to publish the mapping set in the TSV format as a ﬁrst
step. We opted for the embedded mode where mapping set level
metadata are integrated in the mapping TSV ﬁle as commented
YAML (preﬁxed with #). The properties used to describe the
mapping set are presented in Table 1 while those used to describe
each mapping are shown in Table 2. Mandatory properties are
marked with an asterisk (*). For each property, we indicate its
description as stated in the SSSOM model version 0.15. In Section
3, we present a short analysis of advantages and limits of the SSSOM
model.

2.2. Manual alignment method

Previously, we have tested some automatic alignment methods
(Michel et al., 2022) that reused existing reference sources such as
EPPO global database (see text footnote1) and the oﬃcial French
catalog of species and varieties of cultivated plants GEVES (see
text footnote2). The ﬁnal automatic method computes a conﬁdence
score of the mapping between a taxon from TAXREF-LD and a

crop usage from FCU using EPPO database and GEVES catalog.
The main problems come from name ambiguity: depending
on the source (1) the scientiﬁc name may follow or not the
botanical nomenclature code used in TAXREF-LD. For example,
the scientiﬁc name of carrot may be “Daucus carota”, “Daucus
carota L”, or “Daucus carota L, 1753”. (2) The vernacular name
presents in the source may not match exactly the vernacular name
displayed in FCU. For example, the vernacular name of carrot
presents in the source may be “carotte sauvage” (“wild carrot”). This
name does not appear in FCU. (3) The vernacular name present
in the source may not identify precisely a crop usage, that is to
say a FCU concept narrower than “Usages_plantes_cultivees”. For
example, carrot has two crop usages in FCU “carotte potagère”
(“vegetable carrot”) and “carotte fourragère” (“folder carrot”). The
output of the automatic method should be cleaned by human
experts due to the inaccuracy of name comparison.

Thus, we decided to create a new mapping set by asking experts
to propose correct and well-known mappings between crop usages,
taxa, and their scientiﬁc names. All the proposed mappings should
have a high conﬁdence value. If any ambiguity existed, the mapping
should not be created. First, we provided the experts with guidelines
to help them in their decisions. Second, some research tools were
proposed to search terms into the two knowledge graphs. Third,
three curation rules were written to contextualize the mappings
they created and indicate the provenance of the mappings. We
focused on speciﬁc crops: grapevine, carrot, chicory, and tomato
according to the availability of experts.

As shown in Figure 5, two kind of experts are involved.
First, the mapping reviewer proposes some mapping speciﬁcations
based on its knowledge or other information source. A mapping
speciﬁcation looks like :
the taxon “Daucus carota” is used
as “carotte potagère” (“vegetable carrot”). Second, the reviewer

author has to ﬁnd the correct URI from TAXREF-LD and FCU
knowledge graphs to produce the SSSOM mappings following the
mapping speciﬁcations.

2.2.1. Generic guidelines

We provide the following guidelines to help the experts create

their mappings:

1. Only the mappings from FCU crop usages to TAXREF-LD taxa
are represented. We focus on crop usages that belong to the
branch “Usages_plantes_cultivees” to avoid ambiguity. The goal
is to select the most speciﬁc crop usage from FCU and align it to
some TAXREF-LD taxa using the properties deﬁned in Section
2.1.3.

2. If possible the experts should select a reference information
source used to identify the mappings. Each information source
is associated with a curation rule to describe the mapping
identiﬁcation method.

3. First, the experts should create a mapping between a crop
usage and its reference taxon using the annotation property
ontofcu:hasReferenceTaxon. We impose that the ﬁrst reference
taxon has the rank species.

4. Second,

if a more speciﬁc type of

for example, a
subspecies or a variety, is well known as the reference taxon of
the crop usage, another mapping is created using the annotation
property ontofcu:hasReferenceTaxon.

taxon,

5. If the known reference taxon of the crop usage is not available in
TAXREF-LD, another type of mapping should be used. A triple
based on property ontofcu:hasGenericTaxon should be created.

6. Based on the above annotation properties,

the mapping

instance named “fcu:Carottes_potageres.” Notably, this interface
presents ﬁrst English labels, and if no English label is provided, the
French labels are presented. Thus, Figure 6 presents a mixture of
English and French labels.

To be sure to search French labels, another solution is to query
the SPARQL Endpoint.10 For example, the query presented in
Figure 7 search for an instance of skos:Concept that contains the
French word “carotte” in their preferred French label.

As shown in Figure 7, there exist three skos:Concept instances
that have a French preferred label containing the word “carotte.”
Remember that the expert should select FCU concept narrower
than “Usages_plantes_cultivees”. When clicking on one of the
the SPARQL query displayed on Figure 7, e.g.,
results of
fcu:Carrottes_potageres, the expert accesses the RDF description of
the FCU concept, as depicted in Figure 3.

To ﬁnd a taxon in TAXREF-LD, a text search interface is
accessible at http://taxref.i3s.unice.fr/fct/. For example, looking for
the text expression “Daucus carota” provides the results presented
in Figure 8.

should select

line
“taxref:taxon/94503.” The preﬁx “taxref ” indicates that the entity
belongs to TAXREF-LD. The URL part “taxon” indicates that
the entity represents a taxon in TAXREF-LD, that is to say an
OWL class. Then, the experts click on the Web link to display
more information about the entity, as shown in Figures 9, 10.
By navigating through the Web interface, the experts follow the
property “has reference name ” to ﬁnd its scientiﬁc name, as
presented in Figure 11.

2.2.3. Curation rules

Three curation rules were created to document our mappings.
The goal of curation rules is to prove that the source of information
contains the mapping and can be used as mapping justiﬁcation.
Along with the rule, we indicate how to ﬁnd the relevant elements
in each of the mapped resources.

2.2.3.1. CR_Geves

The Oﬃcial Catalog of Species and Varieties of Cultivated Crops
in France from GEVES is a good source of information to ﬁnd
which crop usage is associated with a taxon. As shown in Figure 12,
this catalog indicates for each cultivar (seed used by farmers):

• Its vernacular name in the ﬁeld Common species,
• Its crop usage in the ﬁeld Category,
• Its scientiﬁc name in the ﬁeld Botanical species.

Notably, most of the time, the taxon rank indicated in this
catalog is a species. First, the most speciﬁc crop usage was
selected in the FCU branch “Usages_plantes_cultivees” by using
the information from ﬁelds Common species and Category. Second,
the taxon with the scientiﬁc name indicated in the ﬁeld Botanical
species is searched in TAXREF-LD. If it is possible to ﬁnd the crop

usage and the taxon without ambiguity, the mapping is created and
its conﬁdence value is ﬁxed to one.

For example, based on the information provided in Figure 12
about a carrot cultivar, the expert should ﬁnd in FCU thesaurus the
instance of skos:Concept fcu:Carottes_potageres (see Figure 7). The
expert should also ﬁnd in TAXREF-LD the instance of skos:Concept
identiﬁed by taxref:name/94503 (see Figure 11) and the OWL class
identiﬁed by taxref:taxon/94503 (see Figure 9). Thus, two mappings
are created with a conﬁdence value of one:

• One

between

the

fcu:Carottes_potageres

and the

the

• One between the crop usage fcu:Carottes_potageres and
the taxref:name/94503 reference scientiﬁc name using the
ontofcu:hasReferenceScientiﬁcName object property.

2.2.3.2. CR_C3PO_KB

The Crop Planning and Production Process Ontology and
Knowledge Base (C3PO KB) is a knowledge graph created by
the Elzeard Enterprise (Darnala et al., 2021, 2022). This KG
is another reference source about vegetable.11 The knowledge
graph is accessible as several TTL ﬁles on a git repository.12
To create a mapping between a crop usage and a taxon,
the experts should search into the TTL ﬁle related to the
plant module.13 Figure 13 presents an excerpt of this ﬁle. The
vegetable description contains a crop usage indicated by the
property c3poplant:hasFCUTaxon and a TAXREF-LD scientiﬁc
name indicated by the property c3poplant:hasScientiﬁcName. The
experts should ﬁnd the corresponding taxon by searching in
TAXREF-LD Web interface (following the link “is the reference
name of ”). Based on those information, some new mappings are
created with a conﬁdence value of one.

For example, Figure 13 presents the RDF description in TTL
format of the instance of c3poplant:VegetablePlant related to carrot.
Based on this description, the expert can construct two mappings
with a conﬁdence value of one as follows:

• One

the

between

usage
and the taxref:taxon/133744 subspecies taxon using the
ontofcu:hasReferenceTaxon annotation property.

• One between the crop usage fcu:Carottes_potageres and
the taxref:name/133744 reference scientiﬁc name using the
ontofcu:hasReferenceScientiﬁcName object property.

2.2.3.3. CR_Experts

The experts can also use their own knowledge to state that a
scientiﬁc name is linked to a given crop usage. In this case, the taxon
name is searched in TAXREF-LD. If the scientiﬁc name is retrieved

If the scientiﬁc name is not retrieved (for example, “Cichorium
intybus var. foliosum Hegi f. cylindricum” is the scientiﬁc name of
a form taxon), but the name of a parent taxon can be retrieved
(“Cichorium intybus var. foliosum Hegi ” is the scientiﬁc name
of the variety taxon), the experts should restart the process by
looking for the reference scientiﬁc name of the parent taxon. This
implies that the properties used will be ontofcu:hasGenericTaxon
and ontofcu:hasGenericScientiﬁcName.

The conﬁdence value all these mappings is ﬁxed to one.

3. Analysis

3.1. Alignment challenges

Although the taxonomies and lists of cultivated plants (or crop
usages) refer to living organisms, their alignment raises several
challenges that require manual curation in practice.

A taxonomy is a hierarchical structure that presents a set of
hypotheses uttered by taxonomists on taxa and their relationships.
The names of taxa are regulated by written conventions recorded
in nomenclature codes. The current code in force for plants
is the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and
plants, also known as the Shenzhen Code (Zhang et al., 2013). By
their very nature, taxonomies change over time as the scientiﬁc
consensus between taxonomists evolves. Taxa may merge, split,
spawn, or change taxonomic rank (e.g., from species to subspecies).
Nomenclature codes acknowledge this fact and were designed to
stabilize taxon names as much as possible, given the versatility
of taxonomies.

At a given time, a taxon has a single valid name and possibly a
list of synonyms that have spawned from previous studies. Changes
in the nomenclature are published on an ad hoc basis in the
scientiﬁc literature. However, taxonomies and lists of cultivated
plants are updated at a diﬀerent pace. As a consequence, diﬀerent
references might not be completely up-to-date and may exhibit
discrepancies on speciﬁc taxa. For instance, a list of cultivated
plants may use a scientiﬁc name which is no longer valid or whose
taxon has changed parent taxon or rank.

Additionally, nomenclature codes apply unambiguously to the
species and subspecies taxon ranks but not to the lower ranks (e.g.,
variety or cultivar). On the other hand, the naming of cultivated

plants is not regulated in any way, and a cultivated plant name is
not even required to refer to a scientiﬁc taxon.

plants often retain only a scientiﬁc name instead of a taxon, a name
which may no longer be valid.

Furthermore, due to their complexity, nomenclature codes are
not always strictly observed. For instance, the Oﬃcial Catalog
of Species and Varieties of Cultivated Crops in France gives the
authority without the date (e.g., “L.” instead of “L. 1758”). Lists
of cultivated plants are often built by aggregating several primary
sources. However, these resources seldom cite primary sources,
hindering the assessment of the conﬁdence of their content.

Finally, vernacular names used to denote cultivated plants
are sometimes speciﬁc to a given region, making alignment
locale-dependent.

There are more technical diﬃculties related to modeling choices
for representing taxa, names, and cultivated plants. For example,
TAXREF-LD (Michel et al., 2017) strictly separates taxonomy
and nomenclature. Other resources do distinguish taxonomy and
nomenclature, representing both taxa and their names at the same
level. Some classiﬁcations represent only scientiﬁc names, such as
the Catalog of Life (Hobern et al., 2021). The lists of cultivated

These design and modeling variations raise recurring questions
on the type of objects to be aligned: do we align two taxa, or a taxon
and a name, or a cultivated plant and a taxon, etc.?

Facing these challenges, we have proposed to deﬁne new
mapping properties to represent the link between a crop usage, a
taxon, and its scientiﬁc name.

3.2. SSSOM model analysis

SSSOM is a Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings
which provides means to represent rich metadata for mappings and
mapping sets. This standard representation has several advantages
as follows:

• Entities of diﬀerent nature can be mapped, for example, an

instance of owl:Class with an instance of skos:Concept.

• Mappings can be described as ﬁrst class objects and be
referenced individually with an identiﬁer (URI). This allows to
declare equivalences between mappings coming from various
sources to build aggregated mappings.

• Authors and reviewers of the mappings can be credited for
their study as SSSOM recommends the use of ORCIDs with
the author_id and reviewer_id properties.

The SSSOM project provides a rich documentation with many
examples which facilitates the study. In addition, the SSSOM
community is very active in working on improving and extending
the model based on feedback from use cases issued from varied
communities. This study of publishing mappings led us to

FIGURE 9

• SSSOM does not impose the use of speciﬁc mapping properties
such as owl:equivalentClass, the oboInOwl hasDbXref, or the
well-known SKOS mapping properties, e.g., skos:exactMatch.
In the context of this study, we were, thus, able to deﬁne the
mapping properties relevant to our application (see Section
2.1.3).

• A set of mappings can become a dataset

to be stored
and shared independently of
aligned resources.
Provenance metadata at dataset level allow to document

is also possible

to publish successive versions of a mapping set

mappings may include a property to assert the role of each
component of a combination. If so, our RDF vocabulary
would be extended to provide the types of roles in our
speciﬁc context.

• Negative mappings: the open world assumption holds in
Semantic Web models. This means that the absence of
this does not exist or is
mapping does not mean that
incorrect. Moreover, we want to declare that some mappings
are false or irrelevant. The SSSOM community investigated
two solutions: adding a modiﬁer column or creating negative
mapping properties. As we developed our own mapping
vocabulary, we decided to create some speciﬁc mapping
properties to indicate that a mapping should not exist
between FCU and TAXREF-LD: ontofcu:hasInvalidTaxon /
ontofcu:hasInvalidUsage / ontofcu:hasInvalidScientiﬁcName /
hasInvalidVernacularName.

• Conﬁdence is deﬁned in SSSOM as “A score between 0 and
1 to denote the conﬁdence or probability that the match is
correct, where 1 denotes total conﬁdence.” We are wandering
if this property is relevant in the case of manual alignment.
Concretely, the experts working on this mapping set faced
two diﬃculties in ﬁlling out this ﬁeld. First, it was diﬃcult
to ﬁx a conﬁdence value when they were not completely
sure about a mapping, or even worse, when they disagreed.
For this reason, and also because the SSSOM property lacks
some clarity and is actually under discussion, we agreed

contribute to the discussions taking place on the SSSOM github
repository.14 We expressed our need to document the rules that led
us to assess a given mapping and discussed with the SSSOM authors
on how to represent and expose these rules. As this new feature was
plebiscited by several users, two new properties sssom:curation_rule
and sssom:curation_rule_text were recently added to the SSSOM
model. The rule can be represented either directly in the mapping
set (using sssom:curation_rule_text) or be published as a RDF
resource and be referenced with its URI in the mapping set (using
sssom:curation_rule). As we work in TSV, we decided to give a short
version of each curation rule in the TSV ﬁle of the mapping set, to
refer to this article for a much ﬁner description of our curation rules
2.2.3.

SSSOM, however, still shows some limitations or elements that

are not fully mature as follows:

• Complex mappings:

taxa;

In our case, a crop usage may
be fulﬁlled by a combination of
for instance in
viticulture, a vine plant can be composed of a rootstock
and a graft. The rootstock is the buried part of the vine
and serves as a support
for the graft. Here, we may
want to align crop A with a combination of a taxon B
(rootstock) and a taxon C (graft) and indicate their respective
roles. The future extension of SSSOM to handle complex

on publishing only mappings with a conﬁdence value equal
to one.

• Cardinality: as recommended in the guidelines, this property
should be automatically ﬁlled in. It took a long time to
compute the values and would be diﬃcult to maintain when
more mappings are added to the mapping set.

Overall, SSSOM is a rising metadata standard for sharing,
analyzing, and integrating mappings. It covers our needs pretty
well. The SSSOM project also oﬀers a forum to discuss solutions
with experts and practitioners from various domains.

4. Conclusion and perspectives

This article describes our work on the alignment of two
complementary knowledge graphs useful in agriculture: the crop
usage deﬁned in the thesaurus of cultivated plants in France named
French Crop Usage (FCU) and the taxa and associated scientiﬁc
names deﬁned in the French national
taxonomic repository
TAXREF for fauna, ﬂora, and fungi. Due to the fact that automatic
alignment methods provide poor results, a group of agricultural
experts has produced a set of valid mappings between crop usages,
taxa, and associated scientiﬁc names. To do so, a new RDF

vocabulary of mapping properties was deﬁned to align those plant
descriptions. The metadata for the mappings and the mapping
set are encoded with the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological
Mappings (SSSOM), a new model which oﬀers means to report
on the mapping provenance. To help the mapping creation, we
provided some guidelines and tools to the experts. The produced
mappings are available for download in Recherche Data Gouv, the
federated national platform for research data in France.

Those mappings can be viewed as a ﬁrst eﬀort to test SSSOM
Model using the TSV format. The mappings are manual and
simple ones with high conﬁdence value. Thus, they represent
valid and consolidate mappings. We would like to enrich this
mapping set by taking into account the whole Catalog of GEVES
and C3PO KB. Both are evaluated as good source of information
by our experts. We also plan to exploit these valid mappings
to evaluate automatic alignment methods. The diﬃculty will be

to manage the evolution of FCU and TAXREF-LD and keep
up to date the mappings between those graphs. We would
like to detect automatically obsolete mappings. This study is
a ﬁrst step to test the description of mappings produced by
experts. We hope that it can help other use cases of mapping
between complementary description deﬁning diﬀerent points
of view on the same objects of study. We also hope that
the provision of curated mappings will allow testing of new
automatic methods capable of working with scientiﬁc names and
vernacular names.
