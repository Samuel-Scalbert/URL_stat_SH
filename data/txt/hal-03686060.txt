Plant phenotyping platforms generate large amounts of high-dimensional data at different scales of plant organi-
zation. The possibility to use this information as inputs of models is an opportunity to develop models that inte-
grate new processes and genetic inputs. We assessed to what extent the phenomics and modelling communities can 
address the issues of interoperability and data exchange, using a science mapping approach (i.e. visualization and 
analysis  of  a  broad  range  of  scientific  and  technological  activities  as  a  whole).  In  this  paper,  we  (i)  evaluate  con-
nections, (ii) identify compatible and connectable research topics and (iii) propose strategies to facilitate connec-
tion across communities. We applied a science mapping approach based on reference and term analyses to a set of 
4332 scientific papers published by the plant phenomics and modelling communities from 1980 to 2019, retrieved 
using  the  Elsevier’s  Scopus  database  and  the  quantitative-plant.org  website.  The  number  of  papers  on  phenotyp-
ing and modelling dramatically increased during the past decade, boosted by progress in phenotyping technologies 
and by key developments at hardware and software levels. The science mapping approach indicated a large diversity 
of  research  topics  studied  in  each  community.  Despite  compatibilities  of  research  topics,  the  level  of  connection 
between the phenomics and modelling communities was low. Although phenomics and modelling crucially need to 
exchange data, the two communities appeared to be weakly connected. We encourage these communities to work on 
ontologies, harmonized formats, translators and connectors to facilitate transparent data exchange.

During the past decade, plant phenotyping platforms have generated 
large amounts of detailed data at different spatial and temporal scales 
for thousands of genotypes under controlled conditions or in the field 
(Tardieu et al. 2017). Information extracted from these datasets could 
be more widely used as variables or parameters of mathematical and 
computational models, thereby broadening the scope of information 
extracted from phenomics data (Muller and Martre 2019; Louarn and 
Song 2020). Feeding such data to process-based crop models (models 

representing  crop  characteristics  at  the  field  scale;  Jones  et  al.  2003; 
Holzworth et al. 2014) or individual-based models (models represent-
ing  plants  individually  with  various  degrees  of  architectural  realism, 
e.g. functional–structural plant models; Evers et al. 2018; Louarn and 
Song 2020) in ad hoc pipelines has the potential to predict integrated 
(e.g.  yield)  or  functional  traits  (e.g.  root  system  architecture)  across 
a  wide  range  of  environments  or  management  practices  (Liu  et  al. 
2017;  Chen  et  al.  2019).  Interestingly,  such  interplay  between  mod-
els and data could also help identify which plant traits and metadata

are needed most in model calibration and parametrization, potentially 
identifying  new  traits  or  environmental  data  of  interest  to  the  plant 
phenotyping community (Long 2019). Furthermore, plant phenotyp-
ing platforms supply information to improve robustness and biologi-
cal soundness of plant and crop models by providing detailed data to 
integrate  new  physiological  processes  and  genetic  inputs  (Gosseau 
et al. 2019; Muller and Martre 2019). For example, process-based crop 
models with genotype-dependent parameters will become more wide-
spread as parameters can now be obtained for thousands of genotypes 
in phenotyping platforms (Parent and Tardieu 2014; Casadebaig et al. 
2020).

A  crucial  question  is  to  what  extent  phenomics  and  modelling 
communities  exchange  datasets  and  use  them  together.  Bibliometric 
analysis  and  science  mapping  of  scientific  publications  are  relevant 
approaches  to  assess  current  connections  and  identify  compatible 
and connectable research topics. They have been used to provide new 
insights into specific disciplines (e.g. reveal the historical evolution or 
identify the emerging topics of a research discipline) and provide a field 
overview by visualizing the main research areas of a community. For 
example, bibliometric science mapping has been used to evaluate the 
structure and evolution of Mediterranean forest research (Nardi et al. 
2016). It has also revealed the evolution of plant phenotyping research 
structures (Costa et al. 2019), with a trend toward a higher diversity 
of phenotyped species and research in real field conditions. However, 
bibliometric  mapping  science  has  never  been  applied  to  reveal  and 
evaluate the connections between different scientific communities.

Here,  we  carried  out  bibliometric  analysis  on  a  set  of  scientific 
papers related to plant phenotyping and modelling. We retrieved the 
papers via Elsevier’s Scopus database. Then, we evaluated the connec-
tions and identified compatible research topics between the commu-
nities  using  the  VOSviewer  software  (van  Eck  and  Waltman  2010). 
Finally, we present strategies to facilitate connection across scientific 
communities in the context of the EMPHASIS research infrastructure 
initiative  (European  Infrastructure  for  Multi-scale  Plant  Phenomics 
and  Simulation  for  Food  Security  in  a  Changing  Climate;  https://
emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu/).

2.  M AT E R I A L S   A N D   M ET H O D S
2.1  Scopus search
The Scopus database (https://www.scopus.com/) was used to retrieve 
bibliographic records related to plant phenotyping, plant image analy-
sis software tools (called ‘image analysis tools’ hereafter), process-based 
crop  models  (called  ‘crop  models’  hereafter)  and  individual-based 
models (called ‘plant models’ hereafter) over the period 1980–2019. 
To  identify  relevant  papers  and  retrieve  the  bibliographic  datasets 
associated  with  each  community  (image  analysis  tool  database,  crop 
model database or plant model database), we used the following key-
words in the combined field of title, abstract and keywords for:

 •  the plant phenotyping: phenotyping AND plant*
 •  the image analysis tools: plant* AND image* PRE/2 analys* 

AND software

 •  the crop models: crop PRE/2 model* AND growth AND 
simulation OR crop PRE/2 growth PRE/2 model* AND 
simulation

 •  the plant models: structural* PRE/3 plant* PRE/3 

model* OR functional* PRE/3 plant* PRE/3 model* OR 
structural-functional* PRE/2 model* AND plant* OR 
functional-structural* PRE/2 model* AND plant* AND 
NOT structural* PRE/1 equation*

The  proximity  operator  PRE/n  specifies  the  proximity  (n  being  the 
number of terms) between two terms in an exact order. For instance, 
‘crop  PRE/2  model’  will  find  documents  in  which  ‘crop’  precedes 
‘model’ with no more than two terms in between. The wildcard char-
acter (*) was used to replace or represent one or more characters. For 
instance,  ‘model*’  will  find  documents  in  which  ‘model’,  ‘models’, 
‘modelling’, ‘modeling’, ‘modelled’ or ‘modeled’ appear.

The  Scopus  search  was  conducted  in  June  2020.  For  this  reason, 
2020 papers were not yet completely introduced in the Scopus data-
base and the 2020 papers were not considered in this database.

It should be noted that, due to Scopus limitations, some sources 
could  be  missing  in  the  research.  Indeed,  Scopus  only  analyzes  the 
citations of the journals in its index and has a bias in its coverage of 
European  journals  and  Elsevier  titles.  The  search  was  restricted  to 
papers written in English; therefore, the study might exclude region-
ally important research published in other languages.

2.2  ‘Quantitative Plant’ database
The Scopus database was completed with scientific articles from the 
online  resource  quantitative-plant.org  (Saint  Cast  and  Lobet  2019), 
a  website  referencing plant  image analysis software  tools, crop mod-
els  and  plant  models.  ‘Quantitative  Plant’  extends  the  ‘Plant  Image 
Analysis website’ (Lobet et al. 2013; Lobet 2017). One of the objec-
tives of ‘Quantitative Plant’ is to develop an online portal referencing 
crop and plant models to raise awareness and highlight the diversity of 
models and their applications. This website is hand curated with image 
analysis tools and plant or crop models identified in a thorough review 
of the literature. Each tool and model is presented concisely in a con-
sistent framework and is described by their general characteristics (e.g. 
plant part studied) and uses (e.g. species studied). They are referenced 
by  one  or  more  scientific  articles  presenting  their  characteristics  or 
success stories. These papers were added to the corresponding Scopus 
datasets (image analysis tool database, crop model database or plant 
model database).

2.3  Bibliometric mapping
In order to visualize connections between papers from both communi-
ties, we used the VOSviewer software version 1.6.13 (freely available 
at https://www.vosviewer.com/) which was specifically developed for 
creating,  visualizing  and  exploring  science’s  bibliometric  maps  (van 
Eck  and  Waltman  2010).  VOSviewer  allows  linking  documents  that 
reference the same set of cited documents (i.e. bibliographic coupling 
links). Two articles with at least one common reference are identified 
as  articles  with  a  bibliographic  coupling  relationship  (Kessler  1963; 
Chang and Huang 2012). The method of bibliographic coupling can 
help researchers to filter out a group of articles with a particular type of 
connection by the creation of so-called ‘bibliography coupling maps’ 
(Boyack  and  Klavans  2010).  A  bibliography  coupling  map  is  a  two-
dimensional representation of a research field, in which the distance

between related papers depends on their similarities. Thus, bibliogra-
phy coupling maps provide overviews for visualizing and identifying 
the connection between papers and different cluster groups or com-
munities. To display the elements on the maps, the software uses the 
VOS (Visualization Of Similarities) mapping technique, that is closely 
related to the well-known multidimensional scaling method (van Eck 
and Waltman 2010). The principle of the VOS mapping technique is 
to minimize a weighted sum of squared Euclidean distances between 
all  pairs  of  papers  through  an  optimization  process.  This  mapping 
approach allows laying out papers on the map following the distance 
between each pair of papers that represents their similarity. In a bib-
liographic  coupling  map,  similarities  among  papers  are  calculated 
based on the number of cited reference papers they have in common 
(for  further  explanation  regarding  the  method,  please  see  van  Eck 
and Waltman 2010). The larger the number of cited reference papers 
have  in  common,  the  stronger  the  papers  are  related  to  each  other. 
Therefore, papers citing the same references are closely located to each 
other on the map while less strongly related papers are located farther 
from each other. An example of the bibliographic coupling approach is 
illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.4  Bibliometric clustering
To  identify  clusters  of  related  papers,  the  software  uses  a  weighted 
and parameterized variant of modularity-based clustering, that is the 
VOS clustering technique (Waltman et al. 2010; Waltman and van Eck 
2013). A cluster can be understood as a research area in which one or 
more research topics can be identified. The assignment of two papers 
to the same cluster depends on the cited references the two papers have 
in common. Papers citing the same documents are strongly related to 
each  other  and  are  likely  to  be  assigned  to  the  same  cluster.  On  the 
contrary, papers with a low number of cited references in common are 
likely to be assigned to different clusters. Papers without cited refer-
ences in common with other papers are not assigned to a cluster and 
are absent from the bibliometric maps and analysis.

Figure 1. Example of how the bibliographic coupling approach 
partitions a set of scientific papers. The grey box represents 
the documents within a Scopus dataset (e.g. scientific papers 
associated to the plant phenotyping community). Documents 
W, X, Y and Z are documents outside the set, but are referenced 
by documents within the set. Solid arrows represent citations 
to documents within the set. Dashed arrows represent citations 
to documents outside the set. Colour in the panel shows how 
the documents might be clustered by this approach.

Connecting plant phenotyping and modelling communities  •  3

In  order  for  the  reader  of  the  present  article  to  navigate  all  the 
maps with labels, VOSviewer Map and Network files are available as 
Supporting Information—Figure S1. It should be noted that a biblio-
graphic  coupling  map  represents  a  simplified  version  of  reality  on  a 
subject, owing to the loss of information and partial representation of 
the investigated field (van Raan 2014). This limitation should be con-
sidered when interpreting results.

2.5  Identification of the research topics in each 
community
To identify the research topics of each cluster, an analysis of the most 
common  terms  used  by  the  papers  of  each  cluster  was  performed. 
Terms occurring in titles, abstracts and keywords were extracted from 
papers and analysed to identify the frequency distribution of the key 
terms associated to the papers. The most frequent terms of the cluster 
papers were used to characterize the research topics of each group and 
identify  compatibilities  between  groups  (i.e.  proportion  of  common 
research topics shared).

This  analysis  was  performed  in  R  environment  (R  Development 
Core Team 2019) using the biblioAnalysis function of the bibliometrix 
package (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017).

Before  starting  with  the  analysis,  a  thesaurus  file  was  created  to 
ensure consistency for different term spelling and synonyms (e.g. leaf 
area index is often termed ‘LAI’). We also cleaned the data by omit-
ting terms considered not relevant for analyses: terms related to time, 
publishers’  names  or  geographical  locations  (e.g.  names  of  cities  or 
countries).

3.   R E S U LTS
3.1  Evolution of the trends of publication
A total of 4173 scientific papers were retrieved from the Scopus data-
base, completed by 159 scientific papers from the quantitative-plant.
org website. Approximately, 88.6 % of the papers were research papers, 
6.9 % review papers, 3.4 % book chapters and the remaining 1.1 % were 
books, letters, conference papers or notes. Top journals were Frontiers 
in Plant Science (n = 224; 5.2 %), Field Crop Research (n = 163; 3.8 %), 
Annals of Botany (n = 144; 3.3 %), Plant Methods (n = 132; 3.2 %) and 
Journal of Experimental Botany (n = 120; 2.8 %).

These  papers  were  then  clustered  manually  in  four  categories 
that  belong  to  either  phenomic  or  modelling  communities,  namely 
plant phenotyping, image analysis tools, crop models and plant mod-
els  (numbers  of  papers:  n  =  2074,  n  =  363,  n  =  1567  and  n  =  328, 
respectively).

The  crop  model  community  produced  the  highest  cumulative 
number of papers from 1980 to 2010 (222, 134, 812 and 96 papers in 
21 years for the four aforementioned categories, respectively; Fig. 2). 
Between 2011 and 2019, the paper rate per year increased in all four 
communities (+1853, +435, +117 and +532 %, or 1858, 307, 755 and 
260 additional papers in only 9 years). The trend was close to exponen-
tial for the plant phenotyping community, whose paper rate per year 
increased by about +2600 % in 2015 to 2019 relative to the 1980–2010 
reference (1425 cumulative papers, or more than 68 % of all papers in 
5 years). Similarly, more than 35 % of the image analysis tool and plant 
model papers were published during the last 5 years (i.e. 38 and 41 %,

Figure 2. (A) Number of papers per year and (B) cumulative number of papers from the plant phenotyping (yellow), plant image 
analysis tool (red), process-based crop model (blue) and individual-based model (green) communities from 1980 to 2019.

n = 167 and n = 145, during the period 2015–19 for the image analysis 
tools and plant models, respectively).

3.2  Research topics of the phenomics and modelling 
communities
Most of the scientific papers were grouped into six clusters within each 
community (99, 74, 86 and 99 % of the papers, for the plant phenotyp-
ing, image analysis tools, crop models and plant models, respectively; 
Fig. 3). The clustering procedure discriminated papers according to the 
plant  parts  (e.g.  above-  or  belowground  compartments),  the  species 
(e.g. wheat, maize, rice or Arabidopsis) or the subject area (e.g. biochem-
istry,  genetics,  engineering,  computer  science,  environmental  science 
or mathematics). For example, the blue cluster of the plant model com-
munity is mainly represented by terms related to the shoot part of the 
plant  (i.e.  ‘Light’,  ‘Photosynthesis’  and  ‘Plant  leaf ’;  Fig.  3D),  whereas 
the orange cluster is mainly represented by terms related to the roots 
(i.e. ‘Plant root’, ‘Root system’ and ‘Soil’; Fig. 3D). The complete lists of 
terms identified in each cluster are given in Supporting Information—
Table S1.

Not surprisingly, the communities shared common research topics, 
i.e. high compatibility. For example, the research topics associated to the 
shoot and root in the plant model community (the blue and orange clus-
ters, for the shoot and root parts, respectively; Fig. 3D) were also observed 
in the communities of plant phenotyping (the orange and green clusters, 
for  the  shoot  and  root  parts,  respectively;  Fig.  3A)  and  image  analysis 
(the yellow and the red clusters for the shoot and root parts, respectively;  
Fig. 3B). On the contrary, most of the research topics identified in the 
crop model clusters (e.g. ‘Crop yield’, ‘Climate Change’ or ‘Climate effect’; 
Fig. 3C) were not observed in the others communities.

3.3  Connection between phenomics and modelling 
communities
The coupling map of the four communities combined (4332 articles) 
is presented in Fig. 4. The plant phenotyping community is positioned 
at the left of the map (yellow group in the Fig. 4). It is mingled with the 

image analysis tool papers (red group in Fig. 4) and characterized by a 
wide distribution. This community is characterized by a low number of 
links (i.e. cited references in common with all other scientific papers) 
per paper (249 ± 252; Table 1). The links occur largely between plant 
phenotyping and image analysis tool papers and extend in a lesser pro-
portion, to the crop or plant models (42.1, 32.7, 10.6 and 14.6 % for 
the  plant  phenotyping,  image  analysis  tools,  crop  models  and  plant 
models, respectively; Table 1).

The  image  analysis  tool  community  is  characterized  by  a  lower 
number of links per paper (190 ± 221). A high proportion involved 
the image analysis tool and plant phenotyping papers and, in a lesser 
proportion, the crop or plant models (27.5, 50.2, 7.3 and 15.1 % for the 
plant phenotyping, image analysis tools, crop models and plant mod-
els, respectively).

The crop model community is characterized by a narrow dispersion 
and a low number of links per paper (227 ± 183). A low proportion 
of  links  involved  the  plant  phenotyping  and  the  image  analysis  tool 
communities (7.0 and 2.4 % for the plant phenotyping and the image 
analysis tools, respectively), but a higher proportion involved the plant 
model community (21.7 %). The strong proportion of links between 
crop model papers (69.0 %) highlights a high number of common ref-
erences and a strong connection between papers of this community.

The plant model community is positioned between the plant phe-
notyping and the crop model communities (green group at the center 
of  the  map  in  the  Fig.  4).  It  is  characterized  by  a  narrow  dispersion 
and by a higher number of links compared to the other communities 
(479 ± 268). The proportion of the links with the other communities 
is very low (7.2, 7.1 and 12.2 %).

Figure 3. Bibliography coupling map based on (A) plant phenotyping papers, (B) plant image analysis software tool papers, (C) 
process-based crop model papers and (D) individual-based model papers from the time slice 1980–2019. Dots of different colours 
represent articles belonging to different clusters. The connecting lines indicate the bibliography coupling links between articles. 
In general, the closer two articles are located to each other, the stronger their relation. The two most frequent terms of each paper 
cluster are given below each subplot.

papers indexed in the survey provides a partial representation of the 
crop modelling activity as our research may be biased by the Scopus 
database (i.e. the publications and the journals indexed) and the field 
(i.e. title, abstract and keywords) or the keyword used in Scopus que-
ries. However, the above-mentioned period seems to correspond to the 
early stage of the crop modelling community described by Passioura 
(1996),  Jones  et  al.  (2017)  and  Keating  and  Thorburn  (2018).  This 
early establishment led to the development of a well-organized com-
munity. Several groups (e.g. APSIM, DSSAT, EPIC or STICS; Jones 
et al. 1991, 2003; Brisson et al. 1998; Holzworth et al. 2014), symposia 
(e.g. International Crop Modelling Symposium [iCROPM]; https://
www.icropm2020.org/) and international consortia (e.g. Agricultural 
Model  Intercomparison  Project  [AgMIP];  Rosenzweig  et  al.  2013) 
were initiated to develop, improve and evaluate models. For example, 
AgMIP was designed to improve the capacity of models to describe 
the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  agriculture  systems 
(Rosenzweig  et  al.  2013)  and  involved  the  collaboration  of  diverse 
crop modelling groups (e.g. APSIM, CropSyst, EPIC or WOFOST). 

An important outcome of this project was the development of a plat-
form  that  facilitates  researcher  collaborations  from  many  organiza-
tions, across many countries (Porter et al. 2014).

4.1.2  The  plant  phenotyping  community.  During  the  last  decade, 
research  activity  on  plant  phenotyping  increased  exponentially. 
This  can  be  largely  attributed  to  the  emergence  of  the  phenotyping 
platforms,  the  appearance  of  more  complex  technologies  and  the 
increasing availability of powerful sensors to address the urgent need 
for  structural,  physiological  and  performance-related  plant  traits  to 
ensure  food  security  in  the  coming  decades  (Tardieu  et  al.  2017). 
Indeed,  major  improvements  in  crop  yield  are  needed  to  maintain 
suitable  levels  of  agricultural  production  in  spite  of  soil  degrada-
tion and climate change. Over the past decade, the improvement of 
crop resistance and resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses has ben-
efited from advances in genomic technologies (e.g. low-cost genome 
sequencing). Unfortunately, the characterization of the structure and 
function  of  the  plant  associated  with  its  genetic  and  environmental

components  remained  one  of  the  main  technical  challenges  in 
research programs (Coppens et al. 2017).

The  urgency  to  address  the  need  for  adaptation  of  agricultural 
systems  to  environmental  challenges  requires  collaborative  efforts 
between  communities  communicating  efficiently.  Faced  with  this 
challenge, several national (e.g. German Plant Phenotyping Network, 
French  Plant  Phenotyping  Network  or  North  American  Plant 
Phenotyping  Network)  and  international  (e.g.  International  Plant 
Phenotyping Network [IPPN], European Plant Phenotyping Network 
2020  [EPPN2020]  or  EMPHASIS)  infrastructures  were  initiated  to 
foster the development of novel scientific concepts, sensors and inte-
grated models or phenotyping platforms (Roy et al. 2017).

images provide information about the structure and the physiological 
status of the plant for the scientists (e.g. shape, colour, growth, transpi-
ration or light received) at different spatial and temporal scales (e.g. leaf 
expansion rate of an individual organ or canopy expansion of a popu-
lation; Dhondt et al. 2013; Coppens et al. 2017). Moreover, they can 
be produced for a large diversity of species (e.g. annual or perennial 
species) in experiments performed in controlled conditions or in the 
field, using automatic image recording (Tardieu et al. 2017; Neveu et al. 
2019). This massive and diverse amount of images produced during 
the last decade called for the development of a variety of image analysis 
software tools dedicated to data extraction and analyse (e.g. quantify 
the morphological shoot traits; Lobet et al. 2013).

4.1.3  The  image  analysis  tool  community.  Plant  scientists  have  pro-
duced  massive  datasets  involving  billions  of  images  during  the  last 
decade (Furbank and Tester 2011; Fiorani and Schurr 2013). Indeed,

models emerged in 1988 and the publication of papers remained sta-

diversity  of  the  shoot  and  root  architectures  (e.g.  Pagès  et  al.  1989; 
Prusinkiewicz  et  al.  1996;  Lynch  et  al.  1997;  Godin  and  Caraglio 
1998). Their development was based on newly recognized botanical 
knowledge  (Hallé  1986;  Fitter  1987;  Atger  1991).  After  this  initial 
period, the plant models became more and more complex, describing 
the physiological processes and the endogenous (e.g. the interactions 
between  the  different  organs  of  the  plant)  and  exogenous  (i.e.  the 
interactions between the plant and its abiotic and biotic environment) 
environments of the plant (Godin and Sinoquet 2005; Prusinkiewicz 
and Runions 2012; Dunbabin et al. 2013; Sievänen et al. 2014). This 
increased  complexity  has  been  allowed  by  the  advent  of  computers 
and  the  availability  of  means  of  rapid  computation  (DeJong  et  al. 
2011; Long et al. 2018). Several plant modelling groups have emerged 
around  diverse  plant  parts  (e.g.  above-  or  belowground  compart-
ments)  or  modelling  approaches  (e.g.  purely  descriptive  static  rep-
resentations  of  plants  or  highly  mechanistic  dynamic  simulations). 
Despite  this  diversity,  the  plant  modelling  community  has  initiated 
collaborative  efforts  to  reinforce  connectivity  between  modellers  in 
order to improve and evaluate models (e.g. a collaborative benchmark-
ing of functional–structural root architecture models; Schnepf et al. 
2020). In the same way, the organization of international conferences 
(e.g. ICPMA2021 or FSPM2020) and the development of modelling 
platforms (e.g. GroIMP or OpenAlea; Hemmerling et al. 2008; Pradal 
et al. 2008; Long et al. 2018) allowed promotion of model use, reuse 
and integration of model components designed by others (Sievänen 
et  al.  2014).  Moreover,  reviews  are  often  published  to  illustrate  the 
relevance of this modelling approach at various scales in the fields of 
developmental biology and promote the interest of plant modelling 
to  other  researchers  (e.g.  Fourcaud  et  al.  2007;  DeJong  et  al.  2011; 
Sievänen et al. 2014; Evers et al. 2018; Passot et al. 2019; Louarn and 
Song 2020).

4.2  Assessment of research topics compatibility and 
connection between the communities
The  analysis  of  the  most  common  terms  used  by  the  communities 
highlights  a  high  compatibility  between  the  plant  phenotyping  and 
image analysis tool communities. Most of the research topics identified 
in  the  image  analysis  tool  community  are  also  observed  in  the  plant 
phenotyping community, in accordance with the connection observed 
between these communities. This connection is observed throughout 
the positions of the papers in the bibliographic coupling map (i.e. the 
image analysis tool and plant phenotyping papers are largely mingled; 
Fig. 4) and the number and proportion of links shared between these 
communities (Table 1). The common use of image analysis tools by 
the plant phenotyping community could explain these positions and 
the links with the plant phenotyping. Current phenotyping pipelines 
often rely on imaging techniques, becoming the major tool for pheno-
typic trait measurement (Dhondt et al. 2013).

In  another  way,  compatibilities  of  research  topics  differ  with  the 
connection  between  communities.  Despite  the  large  range  of  topics 
addressed  by  plant  models  and  their  compatibilities  with  the  plant 
phenotyping community, the number and proportion of links shared 
between  communities  are  low.  This  result  is  likely  due  to  the  differ-
ent scientific goals of these communities. On the one hand, the plant 
phenotyping  community  aims  to  identify  structural,  functional  and 

Connecting plant phenotyping and modelling communities  •  7

genetic traits for plant breeding purposes. On another side, the plant 
modelling community aims to describe and understand plant develop-
ment and its interactions with the environment.

An  interesting  result  relates  to  the  position  of  the  plant  model 
community,  which  occupies  a  central  position  in  the  bibliographic 
coupling map. It is positioned between the plant phenotyping and the 
crop model communities. This finding is not trivial as also discussed 
by Louarn and Song (2020). During the last decade, the plant mod-
elling community has expanded greatly its research area. Plant scien-
tists have designed plant models simulating structural and functional 
processes at different scales (i.e. from the cell to the plant communi-
ties), for annual and perennial species (e.g. Arabidopsis, maize, wheat, 
mango  or  palm  plantation;  Barillot  et  al.  2016;  Boudon  et  al.  2020; 
Perez et al. 2019) with the possibility to consider the endogenous and 
the exogenous environment of the plant. Consequently, plant models 
are positioned at the crossroads of plant phenotyping and crop model 
communities. The future challenge could be to improve its connection 
with the other communities to design a well-connected network.

The compatibility between research topics of the crop model com-
munity and the other communities is low. This result can be attributed 
to the scientific goals and spatial scale of this community. Compared 
to other communities, crop models aim to predict yield and potential 
impacts of climate change on agriculture systems. This community rep-
resents crop characteristics at the field scale compared to plant models 
or  phenotyping  platforms  where  each  plant  is  considered  at  various 
levels of architectural realism. However, the application of plant phe-
notyping in the field is under rapid development (Costa et al. 2019). 
This  emerging  topic  was  not  identified  in  our  bibliographic  analysis 
but is likely to be compatible and connectable with the research top-
ics identified in the crop model community. Moreover, terms extracted 
from papers to identify research topics represent a simplified version of 
reality and a partial representation of the investigated field. For exam-
ple, the terms indexed in the keywords of papers depend on the paper 
objectives. Most often, terms extracted from crop model papers high-
lighted the context of the study (e.g. climate change or climate effect; 
applied sciences; Fig. 3) and less the calibration or physiological pro-
cesses integrated by the models, as observed for the plant model papers 
(e.g. source sink dynamics or photosynthesis; fundamental sciences; 
Fig. 3). In this way, the difference in term indexation can bias the iden-
tification of compatibility between the crop model community and the 
other communities.

4.3  Towards an interoperable phenotyping–model-
ling framework: the EMPHASIS guidelines
Previously,  we  identified  a  well-established  connection  between  the 
plant phenotyping and the image analysis tool communities. However, 
although phenomics and modelling crucially need to exchange data, 
the two communities appeared as weakly related. We hypothesize that 
this  lack  of  connection  is  attributed  to  the  lack  of  awareness  of  the 
benefits promoted by each community, the heterogeneous terminol-
ogy  used  by  the  communities  and  the  lack  of  common  platforms  to 
enable transparent data exchange. Here, we present a strategy to move 
towards  better  connection  and  collaboration  between  phenotyping 
and modelling communities. The framework, composed of three stra-
tegic axes, is presented in Fig. 5.

Figure 5. Strategies suggested to facilitate transparent data exchange from phenotyping platform experiments to models and 
vice versa. (A) Promoting the interest and raising the awareness of the diversity of models, phenomics datasets and phenotyping 
platforms by maintaining and advertising the IPPN and EMPHASIS databases, and the quantitative-plant.org web-based 
repository. (B) Improving the lexical and semantic interoperability between communities by designing a structured controlled 
vocabulary for the plant and crop modelling communities arranged in a new ontology (Plant and Crop Modelling Ontology 
[PCMO]). (C) Developing a common hosting platform considering (i) phenomics data in a harmonized format, (ii) phenomics 
data with their associated metadata and (iii) model with their associated translators and connectors to allow the connection 
between phenomics data and other models.

4.3.  1Promote  the  interest  and  raise  awareness.  It  is  currently  chal-
lenging for phenomics researchers to become aware of the diversity of 
models and their applications (Fig. 5A). To solve this first challenge, 
we  developed  the  ‘Quantitative  Plant’  online  portal  (quantitative-
plant.org) allowing the exploration of the diversity of >100 plant and 
crop simulation models and their applications. This web-based reposi-
tory  extends  the  ‘Plant  Image  Analysis’  website  (an  online  database 
for  plant  image  analysis  software  tools;  Lobet  et  al.  2013).  It  helps 
researchers in search for image analysis software for their phenotyp-
ing  experiments to find out potential game-changing  model  applica-
tions on the associated crop or plant model webpage. From now on, 
the  objectives  will  be  to  maintain  and  update  this  online  portal  and 
promote the interest for modelling approaches by advertising this web-
site within the phenomics community (e.g. at conferences, workshops 
and symposia).

A  second  challenge  is  for  the  modelling  community  to  become 
aware  of  the  phenomics  datasets  and  phenotyping  platforms.  To 
address this second challenge, a mapping exercise was carried out by 
IPPN (https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/infrastructure_map) and 
EMPHASIS 
(https://emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu/emphasis_
infrastructure_map) thereby increasing the visibility of phenotyping 
platforms, in collaboration with national plant phenotyping communi-
ties. Surveys were carried out to extract detailed information on exist-
ing and upcoming infrastructures. In addition, platform characteristics 

were inventoried throughout workshops organized in different regions 
of Europe and the World. Phenotyping platforms were described by 
their general characteristics (e.g. installation category: high-through-
put phenotyping facility) and uses (e.g. trait measurements: root prop-
erties). In this way, the IPPN and EMPHASIS databases provide an 
overview of available plant phenotyping platforms and their associated 
characteristics  enabling  users  to  identify  available  solutions  for  their 
project.

4.3.2  Improve  lexical  and  semantic  interoperability.  Currently,  the 
terminology  (e.g.  objects,  variables)  used  by  phenotyping  and  mod-
elling  communities  can  be  quite  heterogeneous  depending  on  the 
research discipline, scale, objectives and even between research groups  
(Fig. 5B). This limits the ability to accurately relate information within 
and  across  communities.  A  solution  to  facilitate  the  connection  and 
the exchange of information is the use of a controlled and standardized 
dictionary of common and internationally recognized terms that can 
be shared among the communities (Walls et al. 2012). The phenomics 
community has tackled these issues by adopting semantic web tech-
nologies including the use of ontologies (e.g. Plant Ontology [PO] or 
Plant Trait Ontology [TO]; Cooper et al. 2013, 2016, 2018). However, 
no  ontology  describing  the  variable  inputs,  the  variable  outputs  and 
the  parameters  of  the  plant  and  crop  models  exists.  Such  ontology 
could  be  used  to  facilitate  exchange  in  and  across  communities,  like

has been done in the bioinformatic community through the Elixir pro-
ject (e.g. the EDAM ontology; Ison et al. 2013). One solution to this 
problem involves the development of structured controlled vocabular-
ies for the plant and crop modelling communities arranged in a new 
ontology (Plant and Crop Modelling Ontology [PCMO]). The goal 
of the PCMO would be to produce structured controlled vocabularies 
of the variables and parameters used by mathematical and computa-
tional models (plant and crop models) with clear definitions and rela-
tions with the existing phenomics ontologies (e.g. description of the 
phenomics variables used in the parameter estimations). In addition 
of the benefit to find compatibilities between phenomics datasets and 
models using ontologies, the PCMO would facilitate the connection 
between  the  models  themselves,  promoting  the  design  of  modular 
models (Christensen et al. 2018; Passot et al. 2018; Benes et al. 2020; 
Peng et al. 2020) or the intercomparison of models (Athanasiadis et al. 
2009; Porter et al. 2014; Schnepf et al. 2020).

4.3.3  Simplify  the  translation.  In  the  future,  a  long-term  coopera-
tion between the phenomics and modelling communities towards the 
development of common platforms could be designed to enable trans-
parent data exchange from models to experiments and vice versa (Fig. 
5C). However, designing such platform is particularly challenging due 
to the diversity and volume of model and data involved. Indeed, the 
development of this platform involves connecting plant or crop mod-
els from different fields of research (i.e. with different syntax, semantics 
and inputs), integrating the huge amount of data generated by pheno-
typing  platforms  from  different  sensors  (e.g.  laser  scanning  systems, 
x-ray  micro-computed  tomography,  magnetic  resonance  imaging  or 
hyperspectral cameras) at different scales (e.g. individual plant in con-
trolled conditions or plant population in the field) and levels of organi-
zation  (e.g.  cell,  tissues,  organ,  plant  and  population),  and  analyzing 
and evaluating the newly designed system with numerical experiment.
To face these challenges, a common hosting platform should:

 1.  Find and store phenomics data with their associated 

metadata. Recent and collaborative efforts were made 
by the plant community to provide access to phenomics 
and genotypic data. A common application programming 
interface (i.e. the public plant Breeding Application 
Programming Interface [BrAPI]; Selby et al. 2019) was 
created to improve interoperability between heterogeneous 
data repositories for breeding data. The implementation 
of this API enables data search in different systems and 
facilitates the integration of data from different disciplines. 
Moreover, the correct interpretation, replicability, 
comparability and interoperability of data rely on an adequate 
set of integrated metadata standards, which list the fields 
required for interpreting the data from a given experiment 
(Ćwiek-Kupczyńska et al. 2016). To address this problem, 
the plant community implemented a metadata model in 
BrAPI, facilitating the metadata implementation from 
different disciplines (e.g. phenotyping or genotyping data). 
Next to BrAPI, the MIAPPE initiative (Krajewski et al. 2015; 
Papoutsoglou et al. 2020), i.e. ‘Minimum Information About 
a Plant Phenotyping Experiment’, had produced a document 

Connecting plant phenotyping and modelling communities  •  9

which specifies default metadata requirements for phenomics 
experiments and a Phenotyping Configuration for the ISA-
Tab format, which allows one to practically organize this 
information within a dataset.

 2.  Store phenomics data in a harmonized format. Several 

phenotyping data management systems have been proposed 
for integrating, managing and sharing multi-source and multi-
scale data in plant phenomics experiments for both controlled 
and field conditions (Köhl and Gremmels 2015; Reynolds 
et al. 2019; Honecker et al. 2020). For example, the Phenomics 
Ontology Driven Data (PODD) repository is an information 
system designed to support phenomics research in Australia. It 
aims to enable efficient storage and retrieval of plant phenotyping 
data and metadata generated by the Australian facilities (Li 
et al. 2013). Similarly, a central web interface and database was 
developed in Belgium, the Plant Systems Biology Interface 
for Plant Phenotype Analysis (PIPPA; https://pippa.psb.
ugent.be/pippa_nav/home/). PIPPA enables management 
of different types of plant phenotyping robots (e.g. WIWAM; 
https://www.wiwam.be/) and analyzing the huge datasets 
generated (Coppens et al. 2017). More recently, the open-source 
Phenotyping Hybrid Information System (PHIS) was developed 
and made available to the phenomics community (Neveu 
et al. 2019; www.phis.inra.fr). Compared to most information 
systems, PHIS has been designed for integrating and sharing 
multi-source and multi-scale data from various phenotyping 
categories of installations (e.g. field or greenhouse).
 3.  Define a list of variables that might be necessary for 

modelling. Most plant and crop models are based on similar 
concepts, although they currently lack the ability to share 
similar variable and parameter inputs. While the various 
models may implement different algorithms, the driving 
variables are generally similar. A basic description of the 
variables used in model calibration and parametrization 
could support modelling applications and connection 
between the phenomics and the modelling community. 
This work will promote recommendations about the general 
information for modelling by defining a list of variables that 
might be necessary to use models. A document defining 
these variables should rather be considered as a checklist and 
recommendations, and consulted by a phenotyping researcher 
interested in modelling to ensure the inclusion of important 
variables for modelling purposes.

 4.  Promote the development of input translator tools to allow 
the generation of model-ready input files from harmonized 
phenomics datasets. Despite the fact that most plant and 
crop models are based on similar concepts and driving data, 
variables and parameters can be different and can have quite 
heterogeneous specifications, as similar processes can have 
different representations and mathematical implementations 
according to the models (Boote et al. 2013). In order to 
facilitate the connection between phenomics variables and 
model inputs, translating data to variable and parameter inputs 
is required for each model. As it was done by the AgMIP 
project, each model could develop a model-specific input

translator, which allows harmonized phenomics dataset to 
directly be translated to model inputs (Porter et al. 2014).
 5.  Develop connector tools to allow the connection between 

models. More than hundred plant and crop models have been 
created in the last two decades. All these models have the 
potential to be reused and combined, broadening the scope of 
their original uses. Connecting such models into integration 
networks has the potential to integrate more complex                 
with isolated models (Passot et al. 2019; Long 2019). The 
integration of several models should be used to generate new 
outputs (e.g. integrated or more complex plant traits), improve 
model predictions or design new strategies (e.g. a multi-scale 
[from gene to globe] crop modelling framework; Benes et al. 
2020; Peng et al. 2020). However, the technological barriers 
introduced by differences in language, data formats, spatial and 
temporal scales, and units have slowed this progress. AgMIP 
has provided a necessary important first step in bringing 
disparate models of each major crop together (Rosenzweig 
et al. 2013). The plant model community has also designed 
modelling platforms (e.g. OpenAlea; Pradal et al. 2008) that 
make sharing of models increasingly feasible. Moreover, 
recent efforts have been made by the plant science and crop 
modelling communities, such as the Crop in silico project 
(Cis; Marshall-Colon et al. 2017) or the collaboration between 
OpenAlea and GroIMP modelling platforms (Long et al. 
2018). For example, the yggdrasil framework (Lang 2019) 
was developed to facilitate asynchronous connection among 
models written in different languages. It operates at different 
scales, resolving the historical problems associated with 
integrative and multi-scale modelling (Kannan et al. 2019). 
More recently, a centralized framework (Crop2ML; Midingoyi 
et al. 2021) and a new derived language (CyML; Midingoyi 
et al. 2020) were created throughout the Agricultural Model 
Exchange Initiative (AMEI) for exchanging, reusing and 
assembling models and model components. These types 
of developments will speed up model construction and the 
creation of application-oriented models and facilitate linkage 
of different types of models. These recent efforts are promising 
and should be encouraged to facilitate the connection between 
plant and crop models.

datasets  and  phenotyping  platforms  that  exist  by  maintaining  and 
advertising online databases. Secondly, we suggest improving the lexi-
cal and semantic interoperability between communities by designing 
a  structured  controlled  vocabulary  for  the  plant  and  crop  modelling 
communities arranged in a new ontology (PCMO). Thirdly, we sug-
gest the development of a common hosting platform considering (i) 
phenomics data with their associated metadata, (ii) phenomics data in 
a harmonized format and (iii) model with their associated translators 
and connectors to allow the connection between phenomics data and 
other models.

In  the  present  analysis,  we  identified  a  well-established  connection 
between the plant phenotyping and the image analysis tool commu-
nities.  However,  the  connection  between  phenomics  and  modelling 
communities was low despite their research topics compatibilities. We 
hypothesize that this lack of connection is attributed to a lack of aware-
ness of the benefits promoted by each community, the heterogeneous 
terminology used by the communities and the lack of common plat-
forms to enable transparent data exchange.

In  the  framework  of  the  EMPHASIS  project,  strategies  were 
proposed  to  move  towards  better  communication  and  collabora-
tion  between  phenotyping  and  modelling  communities.  Firstly,  we 
suggest  raising  the  awareness  of  the  diversity  of  models,  phenomics
