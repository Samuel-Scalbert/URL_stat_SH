SUMMARY

Fresh berries are a popular and important component of the human diet. The demand for high-quality ber-
ries and sustainable production methods is increasing globally, challenging breeders to develop modern
berry cultivars that fulﬁll all desired characteristics. Since 1994, research projects have characterized genetic
resources, developed modern tools for high-throughput screening, and published data in publicly available
repositories. However, the key ﬁndings of different disciplines are rarely linked together, and only a limited
range of traits and genotypes has been investigated. The Horizon2020 project BreedingValue will address
these challenges by studying a broader panel of strawberry, raspberry and blueberry genotypes in detail, in
order to recover the lost genetic diversity that has limited the aroma and ﬂavor intensity of recent cultivars.
We will combine metabolic analysis with sensory panel tests and surveys to identify the key components of
taste, ﬂavor and aroma in berries across Europe, leading to a high-resolution map of quality requirements
for future berry cultivars. Traits linked to berry yields and the effect of environmental stress will be investi-
gated using modern image analysis methods and modeling. We will also use genetic analysis to determine
the genetic basis of complex traits for the development and optimization of modern breeding technologies,
such as molecular marker arrays, genomic selection and genome-wide association studies. Finally, the
results, raw data and metadata will be made publicly available on the open platform Germinate in order to
meet FAIR data principles and provide the basis for sustainable research in the future.

INTRODUCTION

Berries are highly appreciated for their ﬂavor, appearance
and nutrient content, including high levels of antioxidants
for human health (Jimenez Garcia
that are beneﬁcial
et al., 2013). Commercial production in 2020 exceeded 12.9
million tonnes globally and 3.4 million tonnes in Europe
(FAO, 2021). The berries with the largest global production
volumes were strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cur-
rants, cranberries and gooseberries. In Europe, about 50%
of the total production volume was strawberries, followed
by raspberries and currants, each at approximately 20%,
and blueberries at 5%. As well as being a berry producer,
Europe is also a major importer of berries, and the import
volume grew by nearly 40% between 2015 and 2020. The
global production, import and export markets over the last
50 years are shown for strawberries as an example in Fig-
ure 1. The projected continuous increase in the market
demand for berries is driving investments in global
research and production, which will require increased
breeding efforts. This has been recognized at the EU level
by continuous support for EU-coordinated projects, the
same as in the USA and China.

Breeding objectives include higher yields and yield sta-
bility, lower production costs, and better product quality
In the past,
(Capocasa et al., 2008; Cellon et al., 2018).
breeders focused mainly on yield and production costs,
but product quality is now a high priority (Mezzetti
the
et al., 2016; Verma

et al., 2017). This

increases

complexity of breeding programs because additional traits
must be combined in new cultivars (Akdemir et al., 2018).
For berries in particular, traits related to consumer health
and sensorial quality are becoming essential to compete
on the global market (Mazzoni et al., 2016). The substances
that confer aroma, ﬂavor and taste need to be identiﬁed,
along with the environmental stimuli and signaling mecha-
nisms that lead to the accumulation of such bioactive com-
pounds (Paredes-L(cid:1)opez et al., 2010). At
the same time,
new varieties must also incorporate traits that mitigate the
impact of climate change, including resilience to abiotic
stress factors such as water deﬁciency and high tempera-
tures (Bisbis et al., 2019), as well as resistance to pests and
diseases that are spreading to new areas (Bebber
et al., 2013). Many climate change projections predict
lower food availability, quality and nutritional value in the
future (Challinor et al., 2014; Davies & Ribaut, 2017).
Increasing the resilience of cultivars to biotic and abiotic
stress not only ensures yield stability but may also allow
crops to grow in different environments and cultivation
systems. Strawberry cultivation has shifted in part from
the open ﬁeld to controlled/protected environments since
the Montreal Protocol banned widely-used soil disinfec-
tants. To meet the increasing market demand, all cultiva-
therefore
tion systems will be needed. Breeders must
provide a more diverse portfolio of cultivars,
including
those adapted to alternative cultivation systems, while
meeting quality expectations.

The steadily increasing production and import of berries
in Europe may reﬂect consumer awareness of healthy diet
and lifestyle choices (Santeramo et al., 2018). Breeders are
therefore driven to consider the content of minerals, vita-
mins and favorable secondary metabolites in fresh fruits
(Baselice et al., 2017). The high content of bioactive com-
pounds in fresh berries, as opposed to processed fruits,
can contribute to a healthy diet (Paredes-L(cid:1)opez et al., 2010;
Skrovankova et al., 2015). The visual and sensory quality
attributes of fresh fruits strongly inﬂuence the consump-
tion rate (Barrett et al., 2010; Klee & Tieman, 2018). Fur-
thermore, traders demand products with homogeneous or
narrowly-deﬁned qualities that are difﬁcult to achieve for
traits that are inﬂuenced by environmental conditions.

Fresh berries suffer from post-harvest losses at the retail
level due to their short shelf life, which limits proﬁtability
and reduces the sustainability of production by increasing
food waste. In 2020, the European Commission (EC) pre-
sented the Farm-to-Fork (F2F) Strategy as one of the basic
concepts of the Green Deal for a more sustainable society.
Accordingly, sustainable production is an important aspect
of berry cultivation, and must ensure that quality and nutri-
tional standards are maintained or improved. Smart pro-
agricultural
duction
advances
biotechnology are required to meet
these challenges,
including adaptation to new cultivation systems and high-
precision mechanized farming. Such ambitious goals can
be achieved by combining traditional and biotechnology-
assisted production methods,
including research that
focuses on berry breeding (Sabbadini et al., 2021).

PREVIOUS BERRY RESEARCH AND BREEDING EFFORTS

(Diamanti et al., 2012).

Berry breeding is complex, not only due to the multi-
dimensional targets discussed above, but also because
many species are polyploid and/or interspeciﬁc hybrids.
Genetic diversity is severely limited when only a few indi-
viduals are used for breeding without the development of
further pre-breeding material
In
many berry crops, related (sub)species are underutilized in
breeding. Taking strawberry as an example, the genus Fra-
garia comprises 20 species and many subspecies ranging
from diploid to decaploid (Liston et al., 2014). Today’s cul-
tivated strawberry mostly consists of the octoploid inter-
speciﬁc hybrid Fragaria 9 ananassa that was created in
France in the late 1700s and bred in England in the early
1800s (Darrow, 1966). Raspberry and blackberry/bramble
belong to the genus Rubus, which also provides several
(sub)species for intercrossing. Similarly, blueberry, cran-
berry, bilberry and huckleberry belong to the genus Vac-
cinium, with bilberry considered a rich source of genetic
diversity for the development of blueberry pre-breeding
material (Podwyszynska et al., 2021).

To facilitate the development of pre-breeding material,
previous research projects have characterized not only

modern and ancient berry cultivars but also wild relatives
to investigate their potential to increase the genetic diver-
sity of cultivated berry species. Efforts to assess and main-
tain genetic resources for strawberry breeding in Europe
started in 1994, revealing the loss of important material
and narrowing genetic diversity. The EU-funded COST
action 836 (1998–2004) characterized more than 1000
strawberry cultivars and ~400 wild accessions (Geibel
et al., 2004). Follow-up projects were funded to maintain
the identiﬁed core genetic resources, study additional
genetic resources, include more traits, focus on the under-
lying genetics, and clarify technical issues in commercial
production and laboratory protocols. In COST action 863
(2005–2010), 31 partners investigated environmental effects
on the agronomic performance and metabolic proﬁles of
fruit crops, and harmonized analytical standards for the
metabolic proﬁles of small fruits (Mezzetti et al., 2009). The
EU-funded projects GenBerry (2008–2012), RIBESCO (2007–
2011) and EUBerry (2011–2014) characterized strawberry,
raspberry, currant and blueberry genetic resources in order
to assess genetic diversity and conserve the most valuable
material. The genetic and phenotypic data generated in
these projects were linked (including disease resistance),
and techniques were harmonized between partners (Car-
rasco et al., 2007; Karhu et al., 2012; Lerceteau-K€ohler
et al., 2012; Mezzetti et al., 2016; Scalzo et al., 2005; Stafne
et al., 2005; Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al., 2012). As an example,
the GenBerry project highlighted the originality of old
European cultivars, and focused on consumer preferences
for
fresh fruits with high nutritional value (Horvath
et al., 2011). A platform was generated for data compila-
tion, allowing the key characteristics of fruit quality to be
screened in currants and blackberries (Kr€uger et al., 2012;
Tavares et al., 2013), and a core collection of currant
genetic resources was established (Antonius et al., 2012).

The GoodBerry project (2016–2020) brought together 17
European partners, and one each from Chile and China.
They conducted multiple ﬁeld experiments on strawberry,
raspberry and blackcurrant, and collected genotypic, phe-
notypic and sensory data to provide the knowledge and
procedures necessary for the development of elite cultivars
that maintain high yields and quality in a range of environ-
ments (Allwood et al., 2019; Labadie et al., 2019; Pott
et al., 2019, 2020a; Vallarino et al., 2018, 2019; Woznicki
et al., 2016). Whereas earlier projects targeted key acces-
sions and identiﬁed molecular markers to accelerate breed-
ing as well as providing initial methods for sensory
analysis and metabolomics, GoodBerry focused mainly on
the secondary metabolites responsible for aroma,
fruit
quality and stress tolerance (Dur(cid:1)an-Soria et al., 2021),
while still covering environmental adaptation and genetic
resources.
Importantly, GoodBerry studied physiological
and fruit quality traits in individuals from a biparental pop-
ulation planted in ﬁve European countries for a period of

In the framework of

the European Cooperative Pro-
gramme for Plant Genetic Resources (ECPGR), a working
group on berries was established in March 2019 (https://
www.ecpgr.cgiar.org/working-groups/berries; H€ofer, 2021).
The main goal of the 51 members from 22 European coun-
tries is to coordinate activities between the national collec-
tions based on continuous long-term network cooperation
in Europe to create synergies and establish contact points
for berry research projects.

Outside the EU, one of the largest berry-related projects
was funded from 2009 to 2019 by the USDA Specialty Crop
Research Initiative (SCRI), and focused on the US market.
RosBREED (Iezzoni et al., 2020) covered diverse species in
the family Rosaceae, including strawberry and raspberry,
and published genomic data and some phenotypic data in
the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR; https://www.
rosaceae.org), which is still regularly updated by research-
ers and breeders, and includes downloadable data and
software for data visualization and analysis
(Jung
et al., 2019). The USDA-funded Vaccinium Coordinated
Agricultural Project (VacCAP) was launched in 2020 to
investigate the genetic basis of blueberry and cranberry
fruit quality attributes, develop standard genotyping and
phenotyping protocols, and develop or optimize tools and
methods applied by the project partners. Wild accessions
and related species were included in the project to develop
new pre-breeding material. The project established the
Genomic Database for Vaccinium (GDV; https://www.
vaccinium.org), which is similar in function to GDR, but
focuses on blueberry, cranberry and related berry species.
The knowledge from these projects allows the efﬁcient
use of genetic resources, and the creation of new breeding
material that meets the current demands of growers and
consumers. However, the genomic background of certain
stress–response traits and the contribution of particular
metabolites to the overall sensory qualities of berries
remain unknown. Furthermore, a consumer survey across
a wide geographic area has not yet been commissioned to
inform future breeding objectives.

CLASSIFICATION OF BERRY GENETIC RESOURCES

Breeding alternates between increasing genetic variation
and narrowing it by selection to create new cultivars.
Selection is the beginning of a funnel effect that leads to
domestication. The loss of diversity can result in negative
as well as positive effects depending on the initial genetic
diversity of the breeding material and the intensity and
direction of breeding. For example, the negative effects of
breeding include the loss of aroma and stress resistance

BreedingValue project to boost berry breeding 1241

(Aharoni et al., 2004; Ulrich et al., 1997). In strawberry, the
comparison of old and modern cultivars revealed the loss
of up to 35% of allelic diversity (Gil-Ariza et al., 2009; Hor-
vath et al., 2011), in part reﬂecting the limited number of
ancestral accessions used for initial hybridization in the
1700s (Hancock et al., 2010). High-performance cultivars
are predominantly used in breeding programs worldwide
to avoid linkage drag (inferior traits linked to target traits)
from old cultivars or wild relatives. However, focusing on a
small pool of accessions in breeding accelerates the loss
of genetic diversity (Hardigan et al., 2018).

The diversity in current breeding programs can be
assessed by studying the diversity of germplasm used to
develop pre-breeding materials. By comparing the genetic
diversity in old cultivars, modern cultivars, new releases
and material currently undergoing breeding cycles, the
genetic potential of future cultivars can be predicted. The
most valuable genetic resources can then be deﬁned and
future selection gains can be estimated. The categories of
strawberry germplasm recommended for
inclusion in
future studies are listed in Figure 2.

In the EU, plant breeders’ rights are granted for new cul-
tivars, giving the breeder exclusive control over propaga-
tion and the utilization and sale of harvested parts of the
plant for a speciﬁed number of years. The breeder can
choose to license the cultivar or become its exclusive mar-
keter. The new cultivar must fulﬁll the criteria of registra-
tion and trialing.
It must be new (not commercialized
before), distinct from known cultivars, uniform and stable
(characteristics must be genetically ﬁxed, also with respect
to reproduction). Plant materials that are not covered by
plant breeders’ rights can be subject to material transfer
agreements that protect the intellectual property and mate-
rial, and restrict its use. Such agreements can be applied
to pre-breeding material, material that is not yet registered
as a protected cultivar, or any other material that is not
protected under other contracts or regulations.

NEW GENOMIC TOOLS FOR BERRY IMPROVEMENT

Berry breeding efforts have been accelerated by the devel-
opment of high-throughput genotyping tools and efﬁcient
breeding strategies such as marker-assisted selection and
genomic selection. Marker-assisted selection allows the
rapid combination of
traits in pre-breeding material,
whereas genomic selection predicts genetic gains by
applying knowledge about
the effects of each marker.
When genes or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that follow
Mendelian inheritance are identiﬁed, the use of molecular
markers associated with the desirable traits can accelerate
the introgression of the corresponding genomic regions
because numerous markers can be analyzed simultane-
ously.

Panels of markers are available for strawberry (Whi-

blueberry (Rowland et al., 2011), and can be arranged on
arrays. Genomic selection must be applied effectively to
polygenic traits (Crossa et al., 2017), such as resistance to
leaf scorch
powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis),
(Diplocarpon earlianum) and common leaf spot (Myco-
sphaerella fragariae) in strawberry, leaf rust (Phragmidium
rubi-idaei) in raspberry, and sensory quality traits attribu-
ted to numerous metabolites.

Molecular markers are abundant, reliable and widely
used for berry breeding. For example, Axiom 50K and 9K
arrays have been developed to proﬁle single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in strawberry and raspberry, respec-
tively (Hardigan et al., 2020; Jibran et al., 2018). Genome
sequencing provides even more data to facilitate selection
by the detection of functional genes and their roles in trait
expression. The ﬁrst strawberry genome sequence (diploid
woodland strawberry) was therefore seen as a major break-
through (Shulaev et al., 2011). Recent improvements have
made it possible to obtain a phased genome of tetraploid
blueberry (Colle et al., 2019). By contrast, improvements in
long-read sequencing technology (Dumschott et al., 2020;
van Rengs et al., 2022) coupled with open-source technolo-
gies (Chen et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2021; Schrinner
et al., 2020) have unraveled the black raspberry (VanBuren
et al., 2018) and octoploid strawberry (Edger et al., 2019)
genomes, and pangenomic analysis has shed light on the
evolutionary history of strawberry (Feng et al., 2021; Hardi-
gan et al., 2021; Liston et al., 2020; Qiao et al., 2021). For

strawberry, which was found to be generally high in cos-

facilitates population-based studies of breeding germ-
plasm and the diversity within this genepool, allowing
from which
genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
QTLs and genomic prediction models can be derived.
GWAS and genomic selection often utilize the open-source
software GAPIT (Tang et al., 2016) to detect genomic asso-
ciations, and statistical tools such as ASReml-R (Butler
et al., 2017) or BGLR (P(cid:1)erez & Campos, 2014) to develop
prediction models (Davik et al., 2020; Enciso-Rodriguez
et al., 2018; Gezan et al., 2017). Such approaches have
already been applied successfully to strawberry, for exam-
ple in the context of stress resistance (Petrasch et al., 2022;
Pincot et al., 2018).

COMPLETE PHENOTYPING – FROM METABOLOMICS TO
IMAGE ANALYSIS

High-throughput phenotyping is needed in addition to
genotyping for successful genomic selection.
In berries,
high-throughput phenotyping has mainly targeted fruit
quality traits,
including metabolomic proﬁles and fruit
external morphology. Fruit sensory attributes are inﬂu-
enced by numerous traits and therefore have a complex
genetic basis.
In strawberry, the large-scale analysis of
metabolite-based QTLs has identiﬁed loci that determine
the content of sugars, organic acids, amino acids, polyphe-
nols, volatiles and vitamin C (Davik et al., 2020; Lerceteau-
K€ohler et al., 2012; Pott et al., 2020a; Urrutia et al., 2016;
Vallarino et al., 2019; Zorrilla-Fontanesi et al., 2012). Simi-
lar work is underway to identify QTLs that inﬂuence fruit
quality traits in raspberry (Graham & Simpson, 2018;
McCallum et al., 2018; Willman, 2019) and blueberry
(Ferr~ao et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2015).

identiﬁcation (Emwas, 2015), allowing fruit sensory traits
to be associated with the abundance of particular com-
pounds (Allwood et al., 2021). Following the fractionation
of samples by gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chro-
tech-
matography (LC),
niques in plant metabolomics are nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS;
Roessner-Tunali et al., 2003; Sobolev et al., 2015). These
methods are often combined as multi-platform metabolo-
mics techniques such as GC/LC-MS or GC/LC-MS/MS (Gha-
tak et al., 2018). For example, the metabolic response of
ﬁve strawberry cultivars to three different postharvest
treatments over 10 days revealed the metabolic reconﬁgu-
ration of the fruit, including the depletion of major sugars
and acids, a modiﬁed volatile emission proﬁle, and the
accumulation of protective metabolites (Pott et al., 2020b).
Metabolomics has also been used to evaluate the effect of
breeding on fruit metabolomes (Dur(cid:1)an-Soria et al., 2021;
Vallarino et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2018).
Metabolomics can proﬁle metabolic diversity to identify: (i)
accessions suitable as parents; (ii) metabolic markers for
selection; and (iii) certiﬁcation markers in different species
to develop new strategies for crop improvement.

Berries are cultivated under a range of different environ-
ments and agronomic practices. The resulting plasticity
(the ability of a genotype to produce distinct phenotypes in
different environments) is known as the genotype 9 envi-
ronment (G 9 E) interaction (Via & Lande, 1985), and can
change the selection ranking of genotypes across environ-
ments (El-Soda et al., 2014). Understanding G 9 E interac-
tion in berries is therefore necessary to predict growth and
fruit quality, and to adapt breeding strategies for each tar-
geted environment. The effects of G 9 E interactions, envi-
ronment and agronomic practices on fruit quality have
been investigated in strawberry (Di Vittori et al., 2018) and
raspberry (Dur(cid:1)an-Soria et al., 2021), and also in Vaccinium
species (Karppinen et al., 2016).

Image analysis (2D and 3D) is a cost-effective high-
throughput phenotyping tool (Feldmann et al., 2020; He
et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020; Reynolds et al., 2019) used to
analyze berry phenotypic traits in research and breeding or
to sort fruits into quality classes during processing (Liming
& Yanchao, 2010). The automated capture and analysis of
images relating to plant architecture has accelerated the
assessment of growth in model species, but this technol-
ogy has not yet been widely applied to berry crops (Berno-
tas et al., 2019). However, an analytical pipeline based on
the dissection of plants has been developed, combining
multiscale 2D and 3D representations of plant architecture
(Bolger
Labadie
et al., 2019; Schwacke et al., 2019). Mechanistic models
can integrate phenotyping information, and thus simulate
crop responses to environmental variations and their inte-
grated impacts on productivity (Benes et al., 2020; Hopf

et al., 2019; Cockerton

et al., 2019;

models have been designed to integrate root and shoot

simulate the effects of biotic and abiotic stress on 3D plant
architecture (Braghiere et al., 2020).

QUALITY FROM A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE

The basic concept of quality, including intrinsic product
properties and user satisfaction, has evolved to pursue
aims such as ‘total customer satisfaction’ or even ‘cus-
tomer delight’ (F€uller & Matzler, 2008; Yang, 2017). The
quality of berries is based on key sensory parameters such
as taste, ﬂavor and texture, and these should be optimized
to achieve market and consumer demands.

Various international standards exist to evaluate the sen-
sory quality of fresh berries. A harmonized approach is
needed for the evaluation and documentation of fresh fruit
quality, including a standard lexicon consisting of agreed
attributes and descriptive terms relevant to different berry
species, and procedures for the analysis of different berries
adapted for the use of trained panels. The documentation
of small fruit genetic diversity for pre-breeding and com-
mercial purposes will be improved by developing sensory
proﬁles for selected sets of varieties and relating these to
consumer preferences (Oliver et al., 2018a). Combinations
of trained panel testing and laboratory analysis can be
enhanced by collecting data from non-trained consumer
surveys because these represent a greater number of par-
ticipants covering a broader spectrum of geographic
regions, social classes, ages and other demographic cate-
gories.

The motivation for food selection is generally based on
nine factors: health, mood, convenience, sensory appeal,
content of natural ingredients, price, weight control, famil-
iarity, and ethical concerns (Steptoe et al., 1995). The rela-
tive importance of these factors varies according to the
consumer’s country of origin, but sensory appeal and
health are often the highest
ranking factors (Battino
et al., 2019; Januszewska et al., 2011; Kalt et al., 2019; Pap
et al., 2021). The recent review of consumer requirements
and expectations for strawberry quality showed how mod-
ern consumer science methods can help to orient breeding
strategies and commercial decision-making (Predieri
et al., 2021). Consumer preferences for strawberry attri-
butes have been solicited using methods such as check-all-
that-apply (CATA) questionnaires to evaluate new cultivars
(Lado
compared with those already on the market
et al., 2010). CATA questionnaires simultaneously capture
information about ‘overall liking’ and the corresponding
drivers, can segment consumers according to their prefer-
ences, and provide information useful for communication
and marketing. They do not use a numeric scale. Instead,
participants indicate whether a term is appropriate or not
to describe a given product. This allows the investigation

of sensory characteristics in the context of consumption,
the willingness to purchase, and associated emotions. The
effectiveness of this approach is evident from a strawberry
questionnaire, which revealed no differences in ‘overall lik-
ing’, while responses to more speciﬁc questions about ‘ﬂa-
vor liking’ and ‘willingness to pay’
indicated signiﬁcant
differences in appreciation (Lado et al., 2010). The intro-
duction of new technologies and methods to assess con-
sumer acceptance can accelerate breeding and ensure new
berry varieties meet market demands. The Napping test
(Pag(cid:3)es, 2005) is another rapid sensory proﬁling technique,
in which consumers follow their own criteria to differenti-
ate between products, then use their own language to
describe sensory differences using a consumer-friendly
approach known as
(Perrin
et al., 2008). The Napping test successfully segmented
strawberry samples according to sensory traits by compar-
ing the evaluations of untrained consumers with the judg-
ments of a panel of trained experts (Oliver et al., 2018b).
This revealed sensory and lexical similarities and differ-
ences between experts and consumers, helping to improve
communication. The ultra-ﬂash proﬁle has been applied to
14 berry crops,
including strawberry, bilberry and rasp-
berry (Laaksonen et al., 2016).

the ultra-ﬂash proﬁle

As well as highlighting speciﬁc appealing traits, the
fresh berry industry should point out innovative features
related to sensory traits, environmental sustainability and
health. In globalized food markets, innovation has become
the key competitive force (Md Sohel Uz Zaman &
Anjalin, 2011). Accordingly, data concerning the nutraceu-
tical qualities of berries or their environmental impact dur-
ing production are increasingly important for consumers,
and are considered in addition to sensory traits when mak-
ing purchase decisions.

BIG DATA MADE ‘FAIR’

Information describing the attributes of germplasm collec-
tions should be readily available in data repositories so
that users can access germplasm of interest alongside the
associated data, otherwise the value and potential applica-
tions of that germplasm are hidden (Marx, 2013; Nandyala
& Kim, 2016). Users from different application domains
have different levels of expertise. It is therefore crucial that
repositories offer entry points for casual, public and educa-
tional purposes, as well as the ability to support complex
and powerful query and visualization tools required by
expert users. The recording of experimental data from
large, collaborative projects presents unique challenges
that need to be addressed.

A common requirement of journals and funding agen-
cies is that data are made publicly available in standard
digital formats for utilization by others. This also ensures
that germplasm variation identiﬁed or generated in
research projects can be exploited by research and

breeding communities. Guidelines have been established
through initiatives such as FAIR, which stipulates that data
should be ﬁndable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
in order to facilitate (re)utilization (Wilkinson et al., 2016).
Generalized repositories for genetic and genomic data are
hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-
tion (NCBI; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory – European Bioinformatics
Institute (EMBL-EBI; https://www.ebi.ac.uk) and the DNA
Databank of Japan (DDBJ; https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp).
Related initiatives such as the Proteomics Identiﬁcations
Database (PRIDE) exist
for proteins and peptides, and
metabolite databases have been established for metabolo-
mic data (Haug et al., 2020). However, it is challenging to
set up a generalized repository for phenotypic data (Watt
et al., 2020) or consumer perception and organoleptic
qualities.

Furthermore, common standards serving all communi-
ties might not capture all metadata necessary to reproduce
experiments with plants, where pot size or fertilizer input
are examples of unique factors (Poorter et al., 2012).
Therefore, all experimental and trial data should be col-
lected along with informative and standardized metadata
Information
adhering to standards such as the Minimal
(cid:1)
About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE;
Cwiek-
Kupczy(cid:1)nska et al., 2016; Papoutsoglou et al., 2020). Solu-
tions such as the Breeding Application Programing Inter-
face (BrAPI) should also help to standardize data exchange
(Selby et al., 2019).

To facilitate data reanalysis, it is important to specify in
an unambiguous manner the focus of the study, the exper-
imental design, experimental and environmental factors,
and the tools, materials and methods used. Accordingly,
standard operating procedures are especially important in
research, along with a standardized vocabulary and ontolo-
gies to describe environments and/or plants and their
parts. Relevant ontologies are usually developed in global
communities to ensure they are widely accepted and
understood, for example in the Planteome project (Cooper
et al., 2018).

and

programs

The efﬁcient management and distribution of experi-
mental data ensures the rapid incorporation of germplasm
(Raubach
breeding
into
et al., 2021). The dissemination of data within user com-
munities is easier when standardized data formats and
simple data structures exist, as exempliﬁed by genomics
data in the GDR (Jung et al., 2019). Phenotypic and
organoleptic attributes require databases that allow users
to query complex characterization and evaluation data,
including effective visualization tools that provide a deeper
understanding of the data, alongside tools for data export
in formats suitable for downstream analysis. Open-source
information systems
(Raubach
et al., 2021; Shaw et al., 2017) provide such functionality,

such as Germinate

and are used in the soft fruit, stone fruit and cereal com-
munities. The interactive visual
interfaces in Germinate
provide access to information from plant genetic resources
and pre-breeding experiments, and data can be exported
as plain text if necessary. Germplasm and ﬁeld trial sites
can be represented using geographical maps. Complex
phenotypic data can be displayed in a number of ways,
including interactive matrix plots to show correlation, clus-
tering and outliers in datasets comparing traits, or even
the combined analysis of genetic and phenotypic data.
These user-friendly options are particularly useful
for
queries spanning multiple genotypes.

THE BREEDINGVALUE PROJECT TO BOOST EUROPEAN
SOFT FRUIT BREEDING

The challenges outlined above will be addressed by the
new EU-funded project BreedingValue, in which we aim to
connect European strawberry, raspberry and blueberry
germplasm resources with breeding programs, and to
transfer genetic resources, knowledge and tools to
researchers, pre-breeders and other stakeholders. The
holistic approach combines genomic and phenotypic data
(including metabolomics and sensory quality attributes),
and will meet future market and consumer requirements
by applying consumer science (Figure 3). We will publish
our results, raw data and metadata on the Germinate plat-
form (Shaw et al., 2017).

BreedingValue project to boost berry breeding 1245

A wealth of diverse berry germplasm is maintained
among BreedingValue project partners. From these genetic
resources, a core collection of plant material is planned to
be maintained and utilized across the project, encompass-
ing all six deﬁned Plant Categories (Figure 2). For the ﬁrst
project period, more than 2200 genotypes and 33 breeding
populations have been selected (Table 1). When choosing
material for the core germplasm collection, accessions that
are of interest for molecular investigation, for application
of new phenotyping tools, and for consumer sensory tests
will be prioritized.

The project will analyze strawberry genetic resources
from all major European climate regions, integrating all
historical and recent commercial knowledge from success-
ful cultivars, and thus revealing the direction of different
strawberry breeding programs in Europe. The strawberry
germplasm collection includes more than 1700 genotypes
from Plant Category 1 to 5, as deﬁned in Figure 2. Further-
more, several hundreds of plants coming from 27 breeding
populations complement the strawberry material charac-
terization. Diverse raspberry and blueberry germplasm will
also be investigated, albeit in less detail. The chosen rasp-
berry germplasm collection will
include over 400 geno-
types of Categories 1–5, complemented by four breeding
populations. The available blueberry germplasm collection
consists largely of genotypes from a Vaccinium corymbo-
sum genetic background, and includes 79 cultivars across

Plant Categories 1–5, as well as two populations (Table 1).
The germplasm selection might undergo modiﬁcations in
later project periods.

The majority of genotypes in the chosen collection will
be assessed in ﬁeld trials, and will serve as the foundation
for genotyping, phenotyping and consumer science stud-
ies. Field trials will be performed by BreedingValue part-
ners at the various cultivation sites across two growing
seasons, with strawberry and raspberry germplasm
assessed in replicated trials, and blueberry germplasm
maintained in non-replicated plots. Traits related to plant
performance will be assessed among project partners
according to standard phenotypic descriptors deﬁned in
other EU projects (such as EUBerry, COST 836 and Good-
Berry). Traits will include total yield across the season, fruit
quality traits (such as size, color, shape, ﬁrmness and skin
resistance) at the start and peak of the growing season,
total sugar (°Brix) and titratable acids. These data, when
compared with control cultivars, will allow the consortium
to identify genotypes with higher yield and fruit quality
across the different trial sites, and will increase the under-
standing of how the various genetic resources respond in
different environments. Furthermore, a subset of geno-
types will be assessed for resilience by evaluating water
stress resistance (in strawberry and blueberry), and by
assessing resistance to diseases (including powdery mil-
dew and crown rot in strawberry, leaf rust in raspberry,
and dieback and gall midge in blueberry) under artiﬁcial
direct inoculation or natural high disease pressure. A Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA) will also be undertaken on a sub-
set of material in ﬁeld trials to assess agronomic perfor-
mance and sustainability. The LCA analysis will be
performed using the standardized software Simapro v.9
with associated databases, and methodology based on ISO
14040 and ISO 14044.

The development of genomic tools for improved berry
breeding efﬁciency will be facilitated through three
approaches that will be extensively validated. Transfer of
promising pre-breeding accessions, genomic tools and
technologies to berry breeders outlines the strong focus of
BreedingValue towards innovative technologies, and will
have a strong impact on European berry breeding. Firstly,
previously published markers for commercially important
Mendelian traits in strawberry will be made publicly avail-
able for utilization by the breeding and pre-breeding com-
munities. Markers linked to fruit quality traits (such as
aroma, color, soluble acids and sugars, and anthocyanin
content), ﬂowering traits (everbearing) and disease resis-
tances will be prioritized. A low-density SNP array for
marker-assisted selection and cultivar identiﬁcation will be
developed by utilizing Fluidigm(cid:3) SNP TypeTM technology,
which will allow for high-throughput, cost-effective and
reproducible analysis of polyploid strawberry genotypes.
Leaf samples of the BreedingValue strawberry germplasm
collection extended by further accessions from commercial
breeders (obtained through targeted calls) will be geno-
typed on the array, with data linked to phenotypes for
those selections.

The second approach will employ GWAS and genomic
prediction models to target commercially important poly-
genic traits with complex inheritance. The wide range of
plant material from sources within and outside the project
(obtained through targeted calls) will facilitate the model
development. GWAS and genomic prediction models will
mainly be applied to material deﬁned in the Breed-
ingValue germplasm collection, and those available from
related studies. Genotyping of strawberry will be per-
formed on the Axiom 50K SNP array (Hardigan et al.,
2020), with powdery mildew resistance chosen as the can-
didate trait. A 9K axiom is available for raspberry (Jibran
et al., 2018), but the results of a preliminary study will

for our
purposes. Alternatively,
genotyping-by-sequencing
a
approach might be employed, with resistance to late leaf
rust chosen as candidate trait. In addition, phenotypic data
collected across the project for strawberry and raspberry
will be utilized to identify genomic associations. For breed-
ing programs involved with the project through targeted
calls, both a marker-assisted approach and a genomic pre-
diction approach will be utilized. For individual breeders,
the best training set will be determined by selecting mate-
rial that most closely correlates with the test sets (Akdemir
& Isidro-S(cid:1)anchez, 2019), as recently implemented using
the R software environment (Ou & Liao, 2019). The predic-
tive power of the models will be cross-validated rapidly,
whereas full validation by the ﬁeld-testing of selected
accessions is a longer-term goal for a follow-up project.
Simultaneously, material and technology transfer will take
place to breeders and stakeholders by providing pre-

breeding material and by training the participants of tar-
geted calls in how to implement marker-assisted selection,
GWAS or genomic selection in their breeding programs or
companies, and how to use and improve the predictive
models.

The third approach to develop genetic resources
involves an allelic diversity study to assess genetic varia-
tion in strawberry material of the BreedingValue germ-
plasm collection and further accessions provided by
participants of targeted calls from Plant Categories 1, 2
and 3. Genotyping will be performed using the Axiom
50K SNP array. Genetic differentiation between the three
categories can be assessed using the multiallelic exten-
sion of Wright’s ﬁxation index (FST), while phenotypic
data can provide insight into the strength of selection on
quantitative traits and the prevalence and effects of
inbreeding. Extending the project dataset with historic or
open-source data will additionally enable elucidating the
achieved breeding progress in the different cultivar cate-
gories
(Tollenaar &
Lee, 2002).

underlying

factors

and

the

Accurate and efﬁcient phenotyping is essential for culti-
var
improvement, and for developing marker-assisted
selection and genomic prediction tools. The phenotyping
work will focus on image analysis related to yield traits,
and the analysis of sensory attributes and quality traits of
ripe fruits using multi-platform metabolomics techniques.
This will provide valuable information on the phenotypic
properties of the BreedingValue germplasm collection, and
investigate best methods for screening architectural, ripe
fruit quality and post-harvest traits in large germplasm col-
lections and pre-breeding material. Near-infrared spec-
troscopy will be used to image a subset of previously-
phenotyped genotypes. These data will be used to estab-
lish protocols and predictive models for early screening of
fruit ripening, fruit quality features, and biotic and abiotic
stresses. Similarly, hyperspectral and 3D imaging of phe-
notyped strawberry, raspberry and blueberry germplasm
will be analyzed to link imaging data to fruit quality traits
and stress. Image analysis will be optimized to study plant
architectural traits that correlate with yield, allowing the
high-throughput selection of cultivars with better yields. A
novel 3D plant model, calibrated on phenotypic data, will
be developed to deﬁne ideotypes under various environ-
mental conditions, in the open-source OpenAlea platform
(Pradal et al., 2008).

Imaging and metabolite analysis will be performed on a
subset of genotypes across two growing seasons. Data will
be used to assess whether imaging techniques can be uti-
lized as non-invasive and non-destructive alternatives to
infer metabolite levels in fruit. Metabolic analysis will
include quantiﬁcation of folic acid and vitamin levels (par-
ticularly vitamin C). Primary metabolites of nutritive value
(such as individual sugars, acids and phenolics) will be

assessed using GC-TOF-MS (Osorio et al., 2011). Volatile
compounds associated with aroma and ﬂavor will be
assessed by headspace GC-MS (Rambla et al., 2015), while
secondary metabolites grouped into phenylpropanols, ﬂa-
vonoids, anthocyanins and proanthocyanins will be
assessed by LC-MS/MS (Vallarino et al., 2018). In addition,
mass spectral signatures will be used to identify unknown
metabolites that contribute to fruit quality. The metabolo-
mics approach will identify important genetic resources for
thus enabling future selection gains and
conservation,
ensuring recovery from the loss of aroma in recent breed-
ing programs. It will also enable the identiﬁcation of key
metabolites as selection markers and permit metabolomic
data to be used for the certiﬁcation of different berry spe-
cies.

The fruit quality traits and sensory attributes of the
diverse germplasm under investigation will also be charac-
terized by trained panels, and the metabolomic data will
be linked to these sensory proﬁles as the basis for auto-
mated sensory analytics. User-friendly and multilingual
harmonized sensory analysis tools will be developed to
describe the sensory properties that are important to con-
sumers. Sensory proﬁles of a subset of diverse accessions
will subsequently be obtained by panel testing. A broad
consumer survey will be prepared to gain a high-
resolution picture of consumer preferences relating to
strawberries, raspberries and blueberries across the conti-
nent. A targeted call will allow breeders and pre-breeders
across Europe to evaluate and feedback on the developed
consumer sensory test tools and surveys. This will help to
determine future breeding goals and requirements for the
logistics and processing chain.

Finally, the development of new visualization compo-
nents for Germinate,
including consumer preference/
organoleptic data types, will allow BreedingValue to bene-
ﬁt from the current features and functionality of this plat-
form, while adding components speciﬁc to the soft fruit
domain. This will also contribute to the Germinate open
source codebase for the beneﬁt of the worldwide plant
breeding and research community.
