Background/Question/Methods

Naturalist mobile applications have been deployed worldwide in the last years and enabled access to a considerable
amount of geolocated species presences records. This novel type of data represents a crucial step forward to address
ecological and conservation questions through the use of species distribution models (SDMs). However, in the absence of
a sampling protocol, the sampling effort often concentrates on specific locations (cities, riverside walks, etc.) located in
specific environments, resulting in estimation biases in SDMs. We are introducing a new method to estimate unbiased
parameters of ecological niche. It is based on a Poisson process that jointly models niche-based species intensity and
sampling effort. The latter is modelled with a spatial step function defined over a regular mesh. We analytically define the
design of the spatio-environmental domain allowing separation of species intensity from sampling effort. We simulated
virtual species observations in simplistic scenarios to characterize the joint effects of the sampling effort and species
niche models on estimation performance. We applied the approach to Pl@ntNet's citizen science data, integrating several
hundred plant species and hundreds of thousands of observations. We evaluated the species intensity predictions of our
method on complementary presence-absence data and compared them to the MaxEnt predictions and MaxEnt with
Target-Group background approach.

Results/Conclusions

Regarding analytical and simulation results, we show that our method requires the real sampling effort to be
approximately constant over spatial regions where the environmental variables vary significantly. Efficient bias correction
can theoretically be achieved even with one species only. However, it requires many observations to reach a satisfying
precision, and it is thus appropriate for data-intensive citizen science programs. Furthermore, we show how integrating
multiple species, especially some highly observed ones with broader ecological niche, substantially imroves the precision
of each species niche parameter. When applying the method to the Pl@ntNet data, we show that our method significantly
improves niche estimation of species with soft environmental preferences compared to the reference methods. Thus, it
should be a useful tool, when used in synergy with broad coverage and broadband citizen-science data, to monitor the
evolution of invasive or weed species, which are often under-reported in expert datasets.
