Simple Summary: COVID-19 may be more frequent and more severe in cancer patients than in
other individuals. Our aims were to assess the rate of COVID-19 in hospitalized cancer patients,
to describe their demographic characteristics, clinical features and care trajectories, and to assess
the mortality rate. A total of 1148 hospitalized patients were included. The mortality rate was
33%. In multivariate analysis, mortality-related factors were male sex, advanced age, more than two
comorbidities, C-reactive protein >20 ng/mL, primary brain tumors and lung cancer. Risk of dying
was lower among patients with metabolic comorbidities.

mortality rate. Methods: This multicenter cohort study was based on the Electronic Health Records of
the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP). Cancer patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19
between 3 March and 19 May 2020 were included. Main outcome was all-cause mortality within
30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: A total of 29,141 cancer patients were identiﬁed and 7791
(27%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 1359 (17%) were COVID-19-positive and 1148 (84%)
were hospitalized; 217 (19%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. The mortality rate was 33%
(383 deaths). In multivariate analysis, mortality-related factors were male sex (aHR = 1.39 [95% CI:
1.07–1.81]), advanced age (78–86 y: aHR = 2.83 [95% CI: 1.78–4.51] vs. <66 y; 86–103 y: aHR = 2.61
[95% CI: 1.56–4.35] vs. <66 y), more than two comorbidities (aHR = 2.32 [95% CI: 1.41–3.83]) and
C-reactive protein >20 ng/mL (aHR = 2.20 [95% CI: 1.70–2.86]). Primary brains tumors (aHR = 2.19
[95% CI: 1.08–4.44]) and lung cancer (aHR = 1.66 [95% CI: 1.02–2.70]) were associated with higher
mortality. Risk of dying was lower among patients with metabolic comorbidities (aHR = 0.65 [95% CI:
0.50–0.84]). Conclusions: In a hospital-based setting, cancer patients with COVID-19 had a high
mortality rate. This mortality was mainly driven by age, sex, number of comorbidities and presence
of inﬂammation. This is the ﬁrst cohort of cancer patients in which metabolic comorbidities were
associated with a better outcome.

1. Introduction

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, early reports identiﬁed multiple factors
associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 patients, including advanced age, male sex
and comorbidities such as cardio-metabolic disorders, respiratory diseases and cancer [1,2].
Data from China suggested that patients with active or previous cancer were at higher
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [3] and death [4]. On this basis, national and international
guidelines recommended caution regarding the continuation of cancer screening, cancer
treatments and physical follow-up of cancer patients [5].

Previous data suggest that the type of primary malignancy might be associated with
COVID-19 prognosis. The mortality rates for COVID-19 vary widely among cancer patients,
ranging from 9% to 33%, and no clear association has been found between anticancer
therapies, tumor characteristics and COVID-19 mortality. The spread of the pandemic and
its impact is very heterogeneous across and within different countries. These disparities
have motivated epidemiological reports from several countries and institutions, to better
explain the differences in mortality rates observed across studies. Better knowledge of the
risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in cancer patients is crucial and might help to optimize
the management of patients in the future.

In France, the Paris metropolitan area was one of the most affected regions during the

ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aims of the current study were to describe the demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of hospitalized COVID-19-positive cancer patients during the ﬁrst wave of the
pandemic in this region, to determine the in-hospital mortality rate, to assess the care
trajectories and to identify prognostic factors.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design

This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study based on Electronic Health Record
(EHR) data collected prospectively in the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP)
Information System and collated in the AP-HP Health Data Warehouse (EDS AP-HP). The
AP-HP is the main public health establishment and university hospital center in the Paris
metropolitan area, providing hospital care for a population of 6.7 million individuals. The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB: 00011591) on 16 April 2020.

Cancers 2021, 13, 4749

3 of 11

The database was authorized by the National Freedom and Informatics Commission (CNIL
Number: 1980120).

2.2. Setting

AP-HP is the largest hospital system in Europe and one of the largest worldwide. The
39 hospitals of AP-HP (List S2) provide nearly 6 million hospital stays and outpatient visits,
including 1.5 million emergency visits each year. More than 60,000 patients are treated
annually or followed for their cancer in AP-HP centers, including about 40,000 new cases.
A speciﬁc AP-HP COVID clinical data repository (COVID CDR) database was derived
from the institutional clinical data repository, which has integrated administrative and
clinical data from AP-HP centers since 2013 [6]. The COVID CDR includes clinical data
for all patients tested or diagnosed with COVID-19 since 1 January 2020, and collected
during inpatient or outpatient visits. The clinical data is interoperable and standardized
using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model of the Obser-
vational Health Data Science and Informatics distributed data network and international
terminologies.

2.3. Study Population

The study population consisted of all patients, including children, tested for SARS-
CoV-2 and hospitalized during the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic in one of the AP-HP centers.
The diagnosis of cancer was determined using the codes listed in the International Statistical
Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) (main
diagnosis, related diagnosis or associated diagnosis during hospital stay), corresponding
either to cancer or to cancer-related procedures including tumor surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy (Table S1). For each patient, history of cancer during the last 8 years was
taken into account in the CDR.

2.4. Procedures

Demographic characteristics and in-hospital mortality were collected. COVID-19
infection was conﬁrmed by a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Cancer diagnosis,
cancer location and metastatic status were identiﬁed using ICD-10 codes. Coexisting
conditions (hypertension, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhyth-
mia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
chronic kidney disease), and smoking were identiﬁed using ICD-10 codes (main diagno-
sis, related diagnosis, associated diagnosis) during the study period or during previous
hospitalizations (Table S1), except for obesity retrieved in the previous 12 months. Lab-
oratory parameters were collected at the closest date to the SARS-CoV-2 test, within a
5-day window. Cancer treatment within the 3 months preceding COVID-19 diagnosis and
treatment including admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and
drug therapy were retrieved from the database. Manual reading of the in-hospital reports
for each included patient was performed to extract the relevant information.

2.5. Outcomes

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of the diagnosis of
COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were clinical and tumor characteristics, care trajectories
including hospitalization in an ICU, and discharge.

2.6. Statistical Analysis

Baseline demographic, cancer-related and non-cancer-related characteristics are de-
scribed. Categorical variables are described as numbers and percentages, and continuous
variables as medians and interquartile range. The mortality rate was calculated up until
day 30.

Univariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted. The proportional
hazards assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and the Grambsch-Therneau

Cancers 2021, 13, 4749

test. Variables associated with the main endpoint at p < 0.20 were retrieved for multivariate
analysis. Interactions were tested using the Wald test. Forward and backward stepwise
regression was performed to reduce the null model.

The care trajectories of the patients are described according to the initial care (hospital-

ization or ICU hospitalization).

The threshold for statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05. No imputation was
performed. All tests were two-tailed and all statistical analyses were performed using
R® 2.4.3 and Python® 2.4.3.

Reporting was conducted in accordance with observational, routinely-collected data

(RECORD) guidelines [7].

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the Study Population

Between 3 March 2020 and 19 May 2020, 338,781 patients were referred to an AP-HP
hospital (outpatient, or admission), 29,141 of whom either had an active tumor or a history
of cancer (Figure 1). Among them, 7791 (27%) underwent a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. A
total of 1359 patients (17%) had a conﬁrmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Among these, 1148
(84%) were hospitalized and included in the analysis. The main baseline features of the
hospitalized patients are summarized in Table 1. Median age was 76-years and 41% of the
patients were women. Overall, 50% had hypertension, 34% a history or current coronary
heart disease or congestive heart failure, 26% had a history or current cardiac arrhythmia,
31% diabetes mellitus, 27% chronic kidney disease and 22% had COPD. Approximately 11%
of the patients were former or current smokers, 8% were obese and 15% had hyperlipidemia.
In total, 464 patients (40%) had three or more comorbidities.

3.2. Factors Associated with All-Cause Mortality

The all-cause mortality rate within 30 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis was 33%, account-
ing for 383 deaths. In univariate analysis (Tables 1 and 2), patients who died were older,
more likely to be male, more frequently had coronary heart disease or congestive heart
failure, cardiac arrhythmia, COPD, chronic kidney disease, elevated leukocyte counts and
C-reactive protein. In multivariate analysis, older patients (aHR = 2.83 [95% CI: 1.78–4.51]
for 76–86-years-old; aHR = 2.61 [95% CI: 1.56–4.35] for 86–103-years-old) were at higher
risk of dying than patients <66-years-old. Male sex (aHR = 1.39 [95% CI: 1.07–1.81]),
more than two comorbidities (aHR = 2.32 [95% CI: 1.41–3.83]), leukocytes ≥10 × 109/L
(aHR = 1.36 [95% CI: 1.05–1.77]) and C-reactive protein >20 ng/mL (aHR = 2.20 [95% CI:
1.70–2.86]) were also independently associated with mortality (Figure 2). Patients with

brain tumors (aHR = 2.19 [95% CI: 1.08–4.44]) and lung tumors (aHR = 1.66 [95% CI:
1.02–2.70]) had a higher risk of mortality. The risk of mortality was lower among patients
with metabolic comorbidities (obesity, hyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus) (aHR = 0.65
[95% CI: 0.50–0.84]).

4. Discussion

This French multicenter, hospital-based study gathered medical data for more 300,000
patients during the study period, using an EHR Data warehouse. Amongst the cancer
patients who were hospitalized, the mortality rate from COVID-19 was 33%. The main risk
factors for death were advanced age, male sex, number of comorbidities, tumor type (brain
and lung tumors) and presence of biological inﬂammation.

The mortality rate observed in our study was similar to that observed in a UK study [8]
and another French study [9], which reported a mortality rate of 28% and 29%, respectively.
Nevertheless, it is important to stress that the rate of ICU admission differs from one
country to another: 19% in our study population, which is the highest rate. Despite the
constraints encountered during the ﬁrst COVID-19 wave, this shows that the healthcare
settings participating in this study were able to implement the necessary means and provide
additional intensive care beds.

Compared to other multicenter cohort studies [8,10], our study population was
markedly older with more comorbidities, including cardio-metabolic and pulmonary-
associated diseases (Table 3). Tumor site distribution in our cohort differed from that in
Chinese and US cohorts [10,11], which reported more breast cancers [8], but was similar to
that in a UK study [12]. Uncertainty regarding metastatic status deﬁnition exists in other
studies as hematological malignancies may be included, preventing any comparison.

The advanced age of our study population, including inpatients, might account for
the high case-fatality rate observed. It is now well known that age >65-years is a strong
prognostic factor for COVID-19 [11]. It is also known that older cancer patients have an
increased risk of comorbidities and frailty, which are independently associated with higher
mortality rates [13,14]. Since these comorbidities are competing risks of death in older
patients with cancer, it is challenging to demonstrate whether COVID-19-related death
is linked to the underlying cardio-metabolic or pulmonary comorbidity, or to the cancer
and/or its treatments. In some COVID-19 cancer patients, age may also be a criterion for
treatment limitations, particularly in the case of severe comorbidities [15,16]. In our study,
there was an association between number of comorbidities and mortality. Nevertheless,
all the comorbidities did not have the same prognostic value. Metabolic comorbidities
(including obesity, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia) were associated with decreased
mortality. A large number of retrospective studies have suggested that obesity increases the
risk of death associated with COVID-19 [15–17]. Nevertheless, in the French CORONADO
trial [18] evaluating the risk of mechanical ventilation or death by day 7 of hospital admis-
sion, no relationship between obesity and mortality was observed in patients >75-years-old.
The existence of an obesity paradox phenomenon might be explored in older patients with
COVID-19 [19]. Primary data support a greater risk of more severe COVID-19 outcomes in
patients with type 2 diabetes [20]. However, in some large studies, type 2 diabetes was not
associated with COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients [21]. Cholesterol metabolism
has also been the subject of numerous studies and has been identiﬁed as a potential target
for modiﬁcation of viral infectivity. In preclinical studies, higher levels of low-density

lipoproteins may be associated with protection against ICU admission and mortality from
sepsis [22]. Moreover, a large retrospective study demonstrated that the in-hospital use of
statins was associated with a lower risk of mortality [23]. In our study, the use of statins
could be a cofounding factor. Finally, the association between metabolic comorbidities and
a lower risk of mortality could reﬂect the absence of weight loss induced by COVID-19
infection, which is a major prognostic factor in cancer patients [24], especially in those with
obesity. In a recent review, Drucker et al. highlighted the controversies and unresolved
questions that exist in metabolic aspects of SARS-Cov-2 induced pathophysiology [25].

In our population, patients with brain or lung tumors had a poor outcome, with up
to 43% mortality in patients with lung cancer. An high case-fatality rate of around 33%
was also described in recent studies [26,27]. In France, it will be interesting to evaluate the
mortality rates of cancer patients during subsequent waves of COVID-19.

In our study, we found no association between the administration of anticancer
treatments in the previous 3 months and mortality. These data, although incomplete (20%
missing data for anticancer treatments), support current recommendations encouraging
clinicians not to undertreat cancer patients [28].

The main strengths of our study are the very large study population and the inclusion
of exclusively hospitalized patients, precluding the risk of selection bias and the risk of
a biased case-fatality rate. Secondly, the size of the study population led to accurate
estimations. However, the study has several limitations. First, ICD coding habits may
differ among centers leading to a possible classiﬁcation bias. Secondly, ICD coding may

Cancers 2021, 13, 4749

10 of 11

underestimate some comorbidities or behaviors, particularly obesity or smoking. Neuro-
language processing in textual EHR may improve the reliability of these measures. Finally,
this study, similar to other previous studies, was hospital-based, therefore, extrapolation of
our results to all cancer patients in an ambulatory setting needs to be conﬁrmed.

5. Conclusions

The high COVID-19 mortality rate observed amongst cancer patients was mainly
driven by advanced age, male sex and number of cardiovascular and respiratory comor-
bidities. Metabolic comorbidities may be associated with a lower risk of mortality. The
high case-fatality rate strengthens the need to prevent the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
patients with active or previous cancer, and to carefully balance the risk-beneﬁt ratio of
cancer treatments regarding short-term cancer evolution versus risk of COVID-19.
