Creating a virtual reality serious game

Context

Serious game

A serious game for training and rehabilitation of users with low 
vision, using two differents environments

● Complex environment (house interior)
● Dangerous environment (city exterior)

5

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Context

State of art

Some solutions already exist 

X3D (Daly & Brutzman 2007), DSL for 3D content : 

● XML based language usable for VR
● Describe 3D environnement

(texture, position, rotation, …)

Low level language, doesn’t describe :

● Object relations and interactive properties
● How the user perceives, interacts

6

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Context

System for serious game creation

Tool to create serious game DSL 
oriented on describing interactions

Creation of interactive environment
●
Creation of game scenario
●
● Guidance of user during scenario
Analysis of user experience
●

Challenges

Creation of scenario in interactive environment

8

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Context

Building a serious game in virtual reality

Creation present two main complex points:

Interactive environment

●
● Game scenario

Analyse the experience to give feedback

● Record the experience
● Analyse the record

9

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Complexity

Interactive environment

● Complexities:

Large number of objects

○
○ All unique properties and interactions
○ Walls / Objects obstruct player's view

The development team will have to work on each object

10

Game scenario
● Complexities :

Task in a deﬁned or undeﬁned order

○
○ Different types of different tasks
○ Guidance required depending on user's needs

A domain speciﬁc language approach

12

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Solution

Proposed solution

Tool using a DSL to describe the environment and its 
properties, focusing on interactions

● Annotate objects in the scene
● Creating tasks using DSL
● Record user actions and interaction

Gain  of  time  for  the  development  team  on  the 
creation of interactives environments and scenarios

13

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Solution

A domain speciﬁc language ?

Programming  language  with  speciﬁcations  designed 
to meet the constraints of a speciﬁc application area

DSL  oriented  on  describing  interactions  between 
objects composing a 3D scene and the player

● +

○

Syntax represent any concept to use with the domain
Experts modify without programming knowledge

Cost linked to the production and its maintenance
Performance, use processor time less efﬁciently

Solution

Solution

● Deﬁne the layers
●
●
●
●

Annotate the scene
Create a scenario 
Play the scenario
Analyse the user experience

15

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Solution

Deﬁning the layers

The differents types of objects understood by the language

Explain the domain

●
● Can be extended as needed

16

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Solution

Annotation of objects

● Describes the scene by annotating objects
●

Language that can be extended

Allows actions without being predeﬁned

Pot
Layers - Movable, Hot

Interaction - On the table

Interaction - User holding it

Interaction - On the counter

Creating a virtual reality serious game

Solution

Logs

Analyzing logs to check over time :

●
●
●

Player action and interaction with the environment
Player localisation in the environment
Player visible items and range distance

Allow development team to analyse user experience

Perspectives

We are planning to do 2 case studies

Complex environment (house interior)
●
● Dangerous environment (city exterior)

Applicable in any domain to

● Generate content dynamically 
● Understand user experience
● Describe 3D environment with a vocabulary

Interested by using it in a speciﬁc domain
