ABSTRACT
Geocoding a spatial description is challenging since vernacular
place names and vague spatial expressions give uncertainty and
ambiguity to the description. Usually, digital gazetteers are used to
match geospatial objects to their boundaries. However, gazetteers
do not contain all places. Therefore, a number of studies have
proposed to enrich gazetteers by estimating and representing the
vernacular places. Nevertheless, only a few approaches have taken
into account vague spatial expressions such as "nearby", and have
represented geospatial objects as sharp boundaries. In this work, we
present an automatic workflow to retrieve a location approximation
of vague spatial description. We propose a model to estimate a
fuzzy representation of each mentioned geospatial information and
spatial expressions. Then, we perform information fusion to find
a location approximation of a property. Lastly, we demonstrate
our proposed method by applying it to the case of French Real
Estate advertisements with two real-world datasets in Nice and
Paris. Real Estate advertisements allow us to deal with uncertain
geospatial objects since a vague and exaggerated property location’s
description is usually provided. Our results show that our proposed
method is promising and able to correctly approximate a location
from uncertain spatial descriptions.

1 INTRODUCTION
Geographic coordinate systems, such as the World Geodetic System
(WGS84) used by GPS, quantitatively and precisely locate a place.
However, a lot of unstructured (textual) data using natural language,
such as travel blogs, social media in emergencies or Real Estate
advertisements, qualitatively refer to locations. Humans often use
spatial expressions with toponyms (e.g., "West of Nice, France")
which give vagueness and ambiguity to the description. Sometimes,
place types are even preferred to toponyms to locate a place (e.g.,
"Near the beach"). Therefore, uncertainty arises in the description
of locations and poses a challenge to geocode places.

Representing spatial descriptions and in particular spatial expres-
sions, with exact geometries and sharp boundaries might not be
suitable to capture uncertainty. Some solutions represent toponyms
with quantitative spatial expression as polygons (e.g., isochron).
Nevertheless, spatial expressions are not always quantitative (e.g.,
"nearby", "north of", "not far from") and presume fuzzy and impre-
cise boundaries.

Fuzzy set theory uses membership functions to define the degree
to which each point in the space belongs to a fuzzy set. This ap-
proach could deal with uncertain descriptions and represent geospa-
tial objects with fuzzy boundaries. Several studies have proposed
to use fuzzy sets to model natural language location descriptions
([2, 4, 5, 9, 10]) but, to the best of our knowledge, evaluations have
never been carried out on a large scale.

In this paper, we propose to automatically retrieve a location
approximation of a property based on Real Estate descriptions
written in French using fuzzy set theory. Indeed, Real Estate pro-
fessionals do not often give the exact position of a property, and
use vague spatial expression to locate it [7]. Also, location is one
of the most valuable factors of purchasing. Therefore, Real Estate
agents exaggerate boundaries of place names that are popular and
well-reputed to promote a property [8]. Thus, Real Estate ads are
a great source of data to deal with uncertain geospatial objects.
Furthermore, many applications can result from the extracted fuzzy
representation. First, understanding Real Estate language and po-
sitioning online ads are fundamental to evaluate the Real Estate
market and to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the territory. It
could also help professionals to compare their properties for sale
to similar ones. Lastly, fuzzy representations of geospatial objects
might enrich Geographic Information Systems since Real Estate
professionals often mention non-official/local place-names in their
advertisements.

In this work, we present a method to represent a location ap-
proximation of natural language description from Real Estate ad-
vertisements. We first locate and create a fuzzy representation of

each mentioned geospatial information item. Then, we perform
information fusion to find the (fuzzy) location approximation of
the property description. We evaluate the model on two real-world
datasets in Paris and Nice, France.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
the dataset and the methodological details of our model; Section 3
presents and discusses the results of experiments in Paris and Nice;
Finally, Section 4 draws some conclusions and outlines directions
for further research.

2 PROPOSED METHOD
2.1 Dataset
As a case study, we focused on two cities in France: Paris and Nice.
We first collected Real Estate advertisements from various online
advertisers written in French. We extracted the text describing the
property and its location, and the coordinates (latitude/longitude)
given in the metadata. Then, we selected advertisements with pre-
cise coordinates. Indeed, we computed frequency of each pairs of
latitude and longitude and, we found out coordinates with a high
frequency that correspond to the center of the city or the neigh-
bourhood. Thus, we kept pairs with a low frequency (e.g., less than
15 times in the dataset) in order to be at building or street level. The
number of samples for each city is reported in Table 1. Then, we
applied a geospatial information extraction workflow, described in
[3] and designed for Real Estate advertisements, to retrieve enti-
ties (Toponym, Place Type, Spatiotemporal expression, and Mode
of Transportation) and relationships. This method is a two-stage
pipeline involving Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Ex-
traction. The Named Entity Recognition model architecture is a
BiLSTM+CRF combined with a text embedding, whereas the Rela-
tionship Extraction is based on Dependency Parsing.

Avenue des Champs-Elysées". The first one could refer to a neigh-
borhood or the avenue, the second explicitly refers to the avenue
whereas the last one gives an uncertain spatial location around the
avenue. Therefore, we defined a place name ([1]) as follows :

• Toponym,
• or Place Type + Toponym,
• or Spatial Relationship + Toponym,
• or Spatial Relatiosnhip + Place Type + Topoynm.

Then, we estimated place names by using Kernel Density Estima-
tion, which is a non-parametric estimation method that infers the
shape of a variable from a sample, and gives a probability (density)
for each point of the support. In our study, we chose Gaussian
kernels to approximate the boundary of a geospatial object, mainly
because they are well-supported by existing libraries and Gaussian
membership functions are a popular choice for fuzzy sets. For each
place name, we selected all geotagged ads mentioning it, removed
outliers and estimated its footprint based on the advertisements’
coordinates.

Information Fusion. The second step of our model is about
2.2.2
combining all geospatial information to retrieve a location approxi-
mation of the property. We proposed to represent the kernel density
estimation as a fuzzy set to deal with the uncertainty of the data
and use fuzzy operators. In fuzzy sets theory, elements of a set have
degrees of membership, generally in the interval [0,1]. A major
advantage of fuzzy set theory is that it returns an approximation of
the location instead of a sharp area that should be the location. A
fuzzy set 𝐴 is characterized by its membership function 𝜇𝐴 , which
describes the degree of membership of a point in the space to a
fuzzy geographic set. Another advantage is that we can retrieve
crisp sets from the membership function thanks to 𝛼-cuts, defined
as follows:

˜𝐴𝛼

=

(cid:8)𝑥 ∈ 𝐴; 𝜇 ˜𝐴 (𝑥) ≥ 𝛼 (cid:9),

˜𝐴𝛼 , is a crisp set where all the points belonging to
An 𝛼-cut of a set 𝐴,
the set have a degree of membership greater than or equal to 𝛼. We easily
transformed Gaussian kernels into a fuzzy set by taking the density function
(normalized between 0 and 1) as a membership function. Then, we computed
ordered weighted averaging (OWA) [11] membership functions defined as
follows :

𝜇𝑂𝑊 𝐴 (𝑥) =

𝑤𝑗 𝜇 𝑗 (𝑥)

(cid:213)

2.2 Model
We propose to automatically represent a location approximation of
a property from spatial descriptions found in Real Estate advertise-
ments. Our method mainly consists of representing the footprint
of each spatial information item extracted from the text and per-
forming information fusion to find a location approximation of the
property at hand.

2.2.1 Positioning Uncertain Geospatial Information. As we extracted
place names using our workflow designed for Real Estate advertise-
ments, we had to deal with vernacular and local place names. Also,
professionals give a spatial position using vague spatiotemporal
expressions (e.g., "nearby", "close to", "not far away from", etc.). A
place name depends on its name but also on its type and spatial
relationship. For instance, "Champs-Elysées" is different from "Av-
enue des Champs-Elysées", which in turn is different from "Nearby

Figure 1 gives an example of the method applied on a Real Estate adver-
tisement in Paris. The Real Estate professional mentions three identified
place names. Our method estimates the kernel density of the three place
names, and then computes a membership function based on the fusion of
the three relevant fuzzy sets with the arithmetic mean operator. We can see
that the red icon, which is the exact location of the property, belongs to the
fusion of the estimated footprints of these three information items with a
high degree of membership.

3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
In this section, we first introduce the metrics to evaluate our method. Then,
we present and discuss the performance of the method. All the results are
based on the two datasets presented in 2.1 and split in 10 folds to carry out
a cross-validation.

3.1 Evaluation Metrics
To the best of our knowledge, there is no standard evaluation metric to mea-
sure the quality of a fuzzy and imprecise location. In information retrieval
and, in particular toponym resolution, the Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-
Score (F) are widely used to evaluate methods. As we do have coordinates
for each ad, we suggest to use those three metrics with some adaptations to
our problem. We define the following notation:

• 𝐿𝛼

𝐶 : number of ad locations inside the zone found by the system
corresponding to a given 𝛼-cut

: number of ad locations outside the zone found by the system

• 𝐿𝛼
𝐼
corresponding to a given 𝛼-cut
𝑈 : number of ad locations that the system did not find a zone for
a given 𝛼-cut

• 𝐿𝛼

𝑃

=

Therefore, we can compute Precision, Recall and F1-Score as follows :
𝐿𝛼
𝐶
𝐶 + 𝐿𝛼
𝐿𝛼
𝐼
𝐿𝛼
𝐶
𝐶 + 𝐿𝛼
𝐼 + 𝐿𝛼
𝐿𝛼
𝑈
𝑃 × 𝑅
𝑃 + 𝑅

2 ×

𝐹 1

𝑅

=

=

Precision refers to the ratio of the number of ad locations correctly found
inside the zone of a given 𝛼-cut among the number of ad locations that the
system found a zone for the 𝛼-cut. A high precision means that when the
system find a zone for the 𝛼-cut, then the ad coordinates are inside the area.
Recall is the ratio of the number of ad locations correctly found inside
the zone of a given 𝛼-cut among the total number of ad locations. For this
task, the recall has the same definition as accuracy. Recall gives information
about the capability of the system to find a zone for a certain 𝛼-cut. Indeed,
a high precision and a low recall mean that the system is good at finding
ad coordinates inside fuzzy location, but fails to resolve many areas for a
given 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎-cut.

F1-Score summarizes precision and recall in one metric by computing

their harmonic mean.

A limitation of those metrics is that we only differentiate if an ad location
is inside or outside the 𝛼-cut. This binary distinction does not take into
account the area of the zone. A fuzzy location that equals to the entire city

would not be penalized, whereas it is not precise at all. On the other hand,
a small fuzzy location where the ad coordinates are not within but at a very
close distance would be penalized with those metrics. Thus, we propose to
also use a continuous metric called Root Mean Squared Distance (RMSD)
defined by Leidner [6]. RMSD is derived from the Root Mean Squared Error,
which is frequently used to compare predicted and observed values. Here,
RMSD is the root of the arithmetic mean of the squared distance, in meters,
between the ad coordinates 𝑝𝑖 and the most representative point on surface1
𝑐𝑖 of the 𝛼-cut:

𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐷 =

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:116)

1
𝑁

𝑁
(cid:213)

𝑖=1

Δ(𝑝𝑖, 𝑐𝑖 ) 2.

Nevertheless, RMSD only uses ad locations with a zone found for the
𝛼-cut, and does not evaluate the performance of the system to find a fuzzy
representation. Thus, we should find a good compromise between a high
F1-score and a low RMSD.

3.2 Discussion
We first compared the metrics evolution with different 𝛼-cuts based on the
dataset in Nice. We computed the evaluation metrics for 9 values of 𝛼 from
0.1 to 0.9 by cross-validation. We did not calculate 𝛼 = 1 because the fuzzy
representation is a single point and the ad coordinates would practically
never match. Figure 2 summarizes the mean of the evaluation metrics based
on the results of the 10 folds. Regarding precision, recall and F1-score, the
method reaches a high precision for the three operators whereas recall
remains lower. These results highlight that the method does not always
find an area for a given 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎-cut (i.e., low recall), but is very good at
giving a correct area (i.e., high precision). We also notice that the higher
the 𝛼, the lower the performance. For precision, recall and F1-Score this
could be explained by a smaller area (e.g., 𝛼 = 0.9 yield a very small area
and very low performance). On the other hand, RMSD decreases and then
surprisingly increases for 𝛼 ≥ 0.6. We could have expected a better RMSD
for small areas. It means that the smaller the area, the less representative
the location approximation. Lastly, it is difficult to choose a good 𝛼 since
the performance of F1-score decreases and that of RMSD increases with 𝛼.

Secondly, we applied the method on the two datasets. We chose to extract
the 𝛼-cut with 𝛼 = 0.2 since the previous evaluation showed that precision
is above 0.8 and RMSD is smaller than for 𝛼 = 0.1. In Table 2, we noticed that
the method reaches high precision, particularly for Nice. As we trained the
geospatial information extraction model, described in [3], on advertisements
located in the French Riviera, it is not surprising that our method obtains
better results for Nice. Nevertheless, the results shows that the method
is able to generalize to Paris. Regarding the RMSD and area, the method
achieved very good results for Paris. Indeed, we noticed that more points of
interests (POI) such as subways, monuments or museums, are mentioned by
real estate professionals in Paris. This gives a big help to our method in order
to delineate a zone. On the other hand, smaller cities, such as Nice, possess
fewer POIs and real estate professionals often mention the same one (e.g.,
"Promenade des Anglais" in Nice) despite the property is pretty far from
it. Our method is obviously more accurate with more specific geospatial
information.

In a nutshell, this evaluation shows promising results since the method is
able to correctly locate uncertain spatial descriptions in two different cities
(i.e., high precision). A drawback of this method is the low recall which
means that we do not always find boundaries for a number of geospatial
objects. Nevertheless, one could easily boost the results simply by collecting
more data. Another limitation of this study is the choice of 𝛼 = 0.2 based on
the first evaluation in Nice. This value for 𝛼 might not be equally suitable
for every city and method. Finally, we evaluated the method on two big
cities, and a great challenge could be to apply it on a rural area.

4 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented a method to automatically retrieve a lo-
cation approximation of a property from its vague spatial description in
Real Estate advertisements. In order to deal with uncertainty, we have pro-
posed to use fuzzy set theory to represent place names, and combine several
geospatial information items. The method returns an approximate area of
the vague description. Moreover, our method estimates spatial footprints
with a Kernel Density Estimation, based on the coordinates of advertise-
ments, that models the real estate professionals’ exaggeration of using place
names. This method also helps to approximate vernacular place names that
are not found in official gazetteers, and could be used to enrich the latter.
Several directions could be considered to expand this work. First, it would
be desirable to define a metric or criterion capable of summing up in one

figure the quality of a (fuzzy) location approximation and help to choose
an optimal 𝛼. Furthermore, we have not yet treated unnamed entities (e.g.,
"close to the beach", "nearby the university"), whereas they are detected
by our geospatial information extraction model. After delineating a zone
from place names, those terms can restrain the area if we can match them
to footprints (e.g., if there is only one university in the city, we can easily
match it). Also, we would like to add the mode of transportation to better
model spatial expressions (e.g., 5 minutes by car is different from by walk).
