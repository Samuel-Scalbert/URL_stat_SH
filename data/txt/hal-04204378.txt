Abstract. Building accurate knowledge of the identity, the geographic
distribution and the evolution of species is essential for the sustainable
development of humanity, as well as for biodiversity conservation. How-
ever, the diﬀiculty of identifying plants, animals and fungi is hindering
the aggregation of new data and knowledge. Identifying and naming
living organisms is almost impossible for the general public and is of-
ten diﬀicult, even for professionals and naturalists. Bridging this gap is
a key step towards enabling effective biodiversity monitoring systems.
The LifeCLEF campaign, presented in this paper, has been promoting
and evaluating advances in this domain since 2011. The 2023 edition
proposes five data-oriented challenges related to the identification and
prediction of biodiversity: (i) PlantCLEF: very large-scale plant iden-
tification from images, (ii) BirdCLEF: bird species recognition in au-
dio soundscapes, (iii) GeoLifeCLEF: remote sensing based prediction of
species, (iv) SnakeCLEF: snake recognition in medically important sce-
narios, and (v) FungiCLEF: fungi recognition beyond 0-1 cost.

Keywords: biodiversity · machine learning · AI · species identifica-
tion · species prediction · plant identification · bird identification ·

1 Introduction

Accurately identifying organisms observed in the wild is an essential step in
ecological studies. Unfortunately, observing and identifying living organisms re-
quires high levels of expertise. For instance, plants alone account for more than
400,000 different species and the distinctions between them can be quite subtle.
Since the Rio Conference of 1992, this taxonomic gap has been recognized as
one of the major obstacles to the global implementation of the Convention on
Biological Diversity [1]. In 2004, Gaston and O’Neill [6] discussed the potential
of automated approaches for species identification. They suggested that, if the
scientific community were able to (i) produce large training datasets, (ii) pre-
cisely evaluate error rates, (iii) scale-up automated approaches, and (iv) detect
novel species, then it would be possible to develop a generic automated species
identification system that would open up new vistas for research in biology and
related fields.

Since the publication of [6], automated species identification has been studied
in many contexts [5,8,13,23,25,27,28,33]. This area continues to expand rapidly,
particularly due to advances in deep learning [4,7,24,26,29,30,31,32]. In order
to measure progress in a sustainable and repeatable way, the LifeCLEF [3] re-
search platform was created in 2014 as a continuation and extension of the plant
identification task [12] that had been run within the ImageCLEF lab [2] since
2011 [9,10,11]. Since 2014, LifeCLEF expanded the challenge by considering an-
imals and fungi in addition to plants, and including audio and video content in
addition to images [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. LifeCLEF 2023 consists of five
challenges (PlantCLEF, BirdCLEF, GeoLifeCLEF, SnakeCLEF, FungiCLEF),
which we will now describe in turn. Table 1 provides an overview of the data
and tasks of the five challenges.

2 PlantCLEF 2023 Challenge: Identify the World’s Flora

Motivation: It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 species of
vascular plants in the world. Automatic identification has made considerable
progress in recent years as highlighted during previous editions of PlantCLEF.
Deep learning techniques now seem mature enough to address the ultimate but
realistic problem of global identification of plant biodiversity despite many prob-
lems that the data may present (a huge number of classes, very strongly un-
balanced classes, partially erroneous identifications, duplicate pictures, variable
visual quality, diversity of visual contents, e.g., photos, herbarium sheets, etc).
Data collection: the training dataset that will be used this year can be
distinguished into two main categories: trusted and web (i.e., with or without
a strong revision of species names by human experts). The trusted training
subset will be based on a dataset of more than 2.8 million images, covering more
than 80,000 plant species, shared and aggregated by the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF) platform. The web training dataset will be based
on a web crawl with Google & Bing search engines. All datasets provided in
previous editions of PlantCLEF can also be used; the use of external data will
be possible. Finally, the test set will contain more than 60k pictures verified by
world class experts related to various regions of the world and taxonomic groups.
Task description: the task will be evaluated as a plant species retrieval task
based on multi-image plant observations from the test set. The goal will be to
retrieve the correct plant species among the top results of a ranked list of species
returned by the evaluated system. Participants will initially have access to the
training set, followed up a few months later by the whole test set. Self-supervised,
semi-supervised or unsupervised approaches will be strongly encouraged and a
starter package with pre-trained models will be provided.

3 BirdCLEF 2023 Challenge: Bird species identification

in soundscape recordings

Motivation: Recognizing bird sounds in complex soundscapes is an impor-
tant sampling tool that often helps reduce the limitations of point counts. In
the future, archives of recorded soundscapes will become increasingly valuable
as the habitats in which they were recorded will be lost. In the past few years,
deep learning approaches have transformed the field of automated soundscape
analysis. Yet, when training data is sparse, detection systems struggle with the
recognition of rare species. The goal of this competition is to establish training
and test datasets that can serve as real-world applicable evaluation scenarios for
endangered habitats and help the scientific community to advance their conser-
vation efforts through automated bird sound recognition.

Data collection: We will build on the experience from previous editions and
adjust the overall task to encourage participants to focus on few-shot learning
and task-specific model designs. We will select training and test data to suit this
demand. As in previous iterations, Xeno-canto will be the primary source for

4

A. Joly et al.

training data, expertly annotated soundscape recordings will be used for test-
ing. We will focus on bird species for which there is limited training data, but
we will also include common species so that participants can train good recog-
nition systems. In search of suitable test data, we will consider different data
sources with varying complexity (call density, chorus, signal-to-noise ratio, an-
thropophony…), and quality (mono and stereo recordings). We also want to focus
on very specific real-world use cases (e.g., conservation efforts in India) and frame
the competition based on the demand of the particular use case. Additionally, we
are considering including unlabeled data to encourage self-supervised learning
regimes.

Task description: The challenge will be held on Kaggle and the evaluation
mode will resemble the 2022 test mode (i.e., hidden test data, code competi-
tion). We will use established metrics like F1 score and LwLRAP which reflect
use cases for which precision is key and also allow organizers to assess system
performance independent of fine-tuned confidence thresholds. Participants will
be asked to return a list of species for short audio segments extracted from la-
beled soundscape data. In the past, we used 5-second segments, and we will
consider increasing the duration of these context windows to better reflect the
overall ground truth label distribution. However, the overall structure of the task
will remain unchanged, as it provides a well-established base that has resulted
in significant participation in past editions (e.g., 1,019 participants and 23,352
submissions in 2022). Again, we will strive to keep the dataset size reasonably
small (<50 GB) and easy to process, and we will also provide introductory code
repositories and write-ups to lower the entry level of the competition.

4 GeoLifeCLEF 2023 Challenge: Species presence
prediction based on occurrences data and
high-resolution remote sensing images

Motivation: Predicting which species are present in a given area through
species distribution modeling is a central problem in ecology and a crucial is-
sue for biodiversity conservation. Such predictions are a fundamental element of
many decision-making processes, whether for land use planning, the definition of
protected areas or the implementation of more ecological agricultural practices.
The models classically used in ecology are well-established but have the draw-
back of covering only a limited number of species at spatial resolutions often
coarse in the order of kilometers or hundreds of meters at best. The objective of
GeoLifeCLEF is to evaluate models with orders of magnitude hitherto unseen,
whether in terms of the number of species covered (thousands), spatial resolu-
tion (on the order of 10 meters), or the number of occurrences used as training
data (several million). These models have the potential to greatly improve biodi-
versity management processes, especially at the local level (e.g. municipalities),
where the need for spatial and taxonomic precision is greatest.

Data collection: A brand new dataset will be built for the 2023 edition of
GeoLifeCLEF in the framework of a large-scale European project on biodiver-

LifeCLEF 2023 teaser: Species Identification and Prediction Challenges

5

sity monitoring (MAMBO, Horizon EU program). It will contain about 5 million
species occurrences extracted from various selected datasets of the Global Bio-
diversity Information Facility (GBIF) and covering the whole EU territory (38
countries including E.U. members). For the explanatory variables, we will pro-
vide both high resolution remote sensing data (i.e., Sentinel-2 RGB, Near-IR,
Red-Edge and SWIR, along with altitude) and coarser resolution environmen-
tal raster data (e.g., Chelsa climate, SoilGrids, land use, etc.). An important
change this year will be the evaluation and test set composition. We will evalu-
ate model ability to predict the whole set of species present in local sites using
presence-absence data.

Task description: Given a test set of locations (i.e., geo-coordinates) and
corresponding high-resolution remote sensing images and environmental covari-
ates, the goal of the task will be to return for each location the set of species
that are were inventoried at that location. The test set will include only locations
for which an exhaustive plant species inventory is available (i.e., in the form or
presence/absence data).

5 SnakeCLEF 2023 Challenge: Snake Identification in

Medically Important scenarios

Motivation: Developing a robust system for identifying species of snakes
from photographs is an important goal in biodiversity but also for human health.
With over half a million victims of death & disability from venomous snakebite
annually, understanding the global distribution of the > 4,000 species of snakes
and differentiating species from images (particularly images of low quality)
will significantly improve epidemiology data and treatment outcomes. We have
learned from previous editions that “machines” can accurately recognize (FC
1
≈ 90% and Top1 Accuracy ≈ 90%) even in scenarios with long-tailed distribu-
tions and ≈ 1, 600 species. Thus, testing over real Medically Important Scenarios
and specific countries (primarily tropical and subtropical) and integrating the
medical importance of species is the next step that should provide a more reliable
machine prediction.

Data collection: The dataset of the previous year will be extended up
to ≈ 1, 800% snake species from around the world (minimum 10 images per
species). The images will be divided into observations that depict the same snake
individual. Additionally, medical importance (i.e. how venomous the species is)
and country-species relevance will be provided for each species. The evaluation
will be done on various subsets of a newly created “secret” test set with around
50k images.

Task description: Given the set of authentic snake species observations and
corresponding locations, the goal of the task is to create a classification model
that, for each observation, returns a ranked list of predicted species. The classi-
fication model will have to fit limits for memory footprint (ONNX model with
max size of 1GB) and prediction time limit (will be announced later) measured
on the submission server. The model should have to consider and minimize the

6

danger to human life and the waste of antivenom if a bite from the snake in the
image were treated as coming from the top-ranked prediction.

6 FungiCLEF 2023 Challenge: Fungi Recognition Beyond

0-1 Cost

Motivation: Automatic recognition of species at scale, such as in popu-
lar citizen-science projects, requires eﬀicient prediction on limited resources. In
practice, species identification typically depends not solely on the visual obser-
vation of the specimen but also on other information available to the observer,
e.g., habitat, substrate, location and time. Thanks to rich metadata, precise an-
notations, and baselines available to all competitors, the challenge aims at pro-
viding a major benchmark for combining visual observations with other observed
information. Additionally, since mushrooms are often picked for consumption,
misclassification of edible and poisonous mushrooms is an important aspect for
the evaluation of the practical prediction loss.

Data collection: The dataset comes from a citizen science project, the Atlas
of Danish Fungi, where all samples went through an expert validation process,
guaranteeing a high quality of labels. Rich metadata (Habitat, Substrate, Times-
tamp, GPS, EXIF etc.) are provided for most samples. The training set will be
the union of the training and test set (without out-of-scope samples) from the
2022 challenge (i.e. 295,938 training images belonging to 1,604 species observed
mostly in Denmark). The test set will consist of new fungi observations from the
citizen science project.

Task description: Given the set of real fungi species observations and cor-
responding metadata, the goal of the task is to create a classification model that,
for each observation, returns a ranked list of predicted species. The classification
model will have to fit limits for memory footprint (ONNX model with max size
of 1GB) and prediction time limit (will be announced later) measured on the
submission server. The model should have to consider and minimize the danger
to human life, i.e., the confusion between poisonous and edible species. Baseline
procedures of how metadata can help the classification and pre-trained baseline
classifiers will be provided as part of the task description to all participants.

8 Discussion and Conclusion

To fully reach its objective, an evaluation campaign such as LifeCLEF requires
a long-term research effort so as to (i) encourage non-incremental contributions,
(ii) measure consistent performance gaps, (iii) progressively scale-up the problem

LifeCLEF 2023 teaser: Species Identification and Prediction Challenges

and (iv) enable the emergence of a strong community. The 2023 edition of the
lab supports this vision and also includes the following innovations:

– The GeoLifeCLEF challenge will be entirely revisited towards running at the
scale of the whole Europe thanks to a newly created dataset with millions
of occurrences paired with high-resolution remote sensing data.

– The BirdCLEF challenge will include new data with a focus on Central

African species.

– The world’s coverage of PlantCLEF test set will be improved with a focus

on tropical regions and biodiversity hotspots.

– The inclusion of time- and memory-limits within several challenges to en-
courage the use of frugal methods rather than ensembles of tens of models.
