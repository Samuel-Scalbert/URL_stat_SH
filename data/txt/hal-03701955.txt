Abstract
Water uptake by roots is a key adaptation of plants to aerial life. Water uptake depends on root system architecture
(RSA) and tissue hydraulic properties that, together, shape the root hydraulic architecture. This work investigates how
the interplay between conductivities along radial (e.g. aquaporins) and axial (e.g. xylem vessels) pathways determines
the water transport properties of highly branched RSAs as found in adult Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. A
hydraulic model named HydroRoot was developed, based on multi-scale tree graph representations of RSAs. Root wa-
ter ﬂow was measured by the pressure chamber technique after successive cuts of a same root system from the tip to-
ward the base. HydroRoot model inversion in corresponding RSAs allowed us to concomitantly determine radial and
axial conductivities, providing evidence that the latter is often overestimated by classical evaluation based on the
Hagen–Poiseuille law. Organizing principles of Arabidopsis primary and lateral root growth and branching were deter-
mined and used to apply the HydroRoot model to an extended set of simulated RSAs. Sensitivity analyses revealed
that water transport can be co-limited by radial and axial conductances throughout the whole RSA. The number of
roots that can be sectioned (intercepted) at a given distance from the base was deﬁned as an accessible and informa-
tive indicator of RSA. The overall set of experimental and theoretical procedures was applied to plants mutated in
ESKIMO1 and previously shown to have xylem collapse. This approach will be instrumental to dissect the root water
transport phenotype of plants with intricate alterations in root growth or transport functions.

life. Taking place at the plant–soil

Introduction
Water uptake by roots represents a key adaptation of plants
to aerial
interface, this
process is highly dependent on the root system architecture
(RSA). Most root systems are highly complex, branched
structures with, for instance, thousands of ramifications and
a cumulated length of several hundreds of meters for a sin-
gle maize (Zea mays) plant. These systems are also highly
dynamic. In particular, water availability interferes with the
orientation and rate of primary root growth and the fre-
quency and symmetry of root branching thereby promoting
water resource foraging (Klein et al., 2020; Maurel and
Nacry, 2020). The ability of root systems to reach deep soil
layers at reduced cost was proposed to be a key trait for ac-
climation to water-deprived environments (Lynch, 2013).
Yet, a comprehensive view of how elementary water trans-
port processes occur in root tissues and integrate within the
is
RSA, thereby shaping the root hydraulic architecture,
needed to fully comprehend the water uptake capacity of
plants.

Water uptake and its subsequent transport within the
plant are determined by the gradient of water potentials
throughout the soil–plant–atmosphere-continuum (Steudle,
2001; Draye et al., 2010). Following radial transport across
peripheral cell
layers (epidermis, cortex, and endodermis),
soil water reaches the stele and xylem vessels where it is
transported axially to the plant aerial parts. These radial and
axial processes, that are often presented sequentially, actu-
ally operate simultaneously and throughout the whole RSA.
In most physiological studies of root water transport, axial
conductance was inferred from xylem vessel size using the
Hagen–Poiseuille law (Steudle and Peterson, 1998; Lefebvre
et al., 2011; Klein et al., 2020). Because it is the site for for-
mation of xylem vessels, the root tip was identified as the
main resistive place for axial water transport whereas axial
limitation was supposedly negligible in older root segments
due to the presence of large metaxylem vessels (Steudle and
Peterson, 1998). In contrast, radial transport which is often
represented as a combination of cell-to-cell and cell wall
(apoplastic) paths running in parallel, was proposed to ex-
plain fundamental hydraulic properties of the whole root
(Steudle and Peterson, 1998; Barrowclough et al., 2000;
Knipfer and Fricke, 2011).

Several types of numerical hydraulic models have been de-
veloped to address the complexity of root water uptake,
and radial transport in particular. Whereas early models in-
tegrated concentric hydraulic resistances within a root radial
section (Steudle and Jeschke, 1983;
Jones et al., 1988;
Bramley et al., 2009), modeling was recently applied to a
more precise, cell-based view of the root radial anatomy
(Couvreur et al., 2018; Heymans et al., 2021). Biophysical
models have also addressed water transport at whole root
level. With respect to models that describe the functioning
of root segments (Frensch and Steudle, 1989; Zwieniecki
et al., 2003; Zarebanadkouki et al., 2014) or use a simplified
representation of root system hydraulics (Knipfer and Fricke,

2011), Doussan et al. integrated an explicit description of
RSA with hydraulics. To be linked to soil water transfer,
hydraulic functioning of the root had, however, to be re-
duced to simplified radial and axial processes (Doussan
et al., 1998a, 1998b). Since then, there have been several
attempts to refine the hydraulic functioning of elemen-
tary root segments at the whole root level (Zwieniecki
et al., 2003; Draye et al., 2010; Javaux et al., 2013; Foster
and Miklavcic, 2016; Bouda et al., 2018). More recently,
Meunier et al. (2017b, 2017c) developed a hybrid analyti-
cal–numerical model of root water uptake with increased
computational efficiency.

Despite these efforts, the respective limitations of axial
and radial conductances and their precise contribution to
whole root hydraulics remain key and as yet unresolved
issues. Based on a porous pipe representation of unitary
roots, Zwieniecki et al. (2003) showed that axial hydraulic
limitation can lead to saturation of root conductance mean-
ing that long roots do not provide any additional advantage
in terms of overall flux intensity (Zwieniecki et al., 2003;
Meunier et al., 2017a, 2018). This view was recently ex-
tended to entire root networks which, however, remained
theoretical
in nature (Bouda et al., 2018). While these
modeling approaches point to key hydraulic properties of
root systems, most of them were assessed with scarce or
heterogeneous experimental data.

accurate

hydraulic measurements.

With respect to native, soil-imbedded root systems, roots
excised from hydroponically grown plants are more easily
amenable
In
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in particular, the pressure
chamber technique has proved efficient for addressing fun-
damental root hydraulics properties in various genotypes or
environmental conditions (Postaire et al., 2010; Sutka et al.,
2011; Di Pietro et al., 2013). More specifically, this technique
provides access to the whole root system hydraulic conduc-
tivity (Lpr) and allows to take into account the contribution
of fragile lateral roots.

Here, we used pressure chamber measurements coupled
with a modeling approach to investigate how the interplay
between radial and axial conductivities determines the water
transport properties of complex and realistic RSAs. By com-
bining experimental and computational modeling proce-
dures, this work shows how radial and axial conductivities
can be concomitantly determined and reveals contexts in
which axial conductance can be limiting. The overall ap-
proach can also help dissect the root water transport phe-
notype of plants with complex alterations in root growth or
transport functions.

transport capacity was measured by the pressure cham-

(Figure 1A). The root systems of these plants exhibit a
substantial complexity with total length up to 2.1 m, and
up to 354 root extremities corresponding to a primary
root carrying two orders of lateral roots (Table 1). We
described quantitatively the individual RSAs by con-
(MTGs)
structing dynamical multi-scale tree graphs
(Godin and Caraglio, 1998). The graph nodes repre-
sented plant segments of 100 mm (equivalent to the
range of a cell length) and contained information on the
position of the different branching points (Godin et al.,

1999; Danjon and Reubens, 2008; Lobet et al., 2015;

diameters of the primary and lateral roots were fairly ho-
mogeneous within each branching order but were re-
duced by 30%–40% between successive orders, varying
from 188 ± 22 mm (±SD; n = 64) in the primary root to as
low as 69 mm in second order lateral roots. Thus, exter-
nal root surfaces were calculated in the MTGs, assuming
that root diameter was constant for a given root order,
with a 30% decrease between successive root orders.

Water ﬂow was measured using the pressure chamber technique in excised root sys-
tems from the indicated individual plants (two biological replicates). RSAs were
then exhaustively analyzed. The table summarizes integrated parameters from these
measurements and the k values calculated using HydroRoot to match the measured
water ﬂows. The axial conductance was calibrated according to Hagen–Poiseuille
law, and the same lowess ﬁt proﬁle, as shown in Supplemental Figure S1, was used
for all RSAs.

In this model,

Based on these detailed RSA representations, we devel-
oped a hydraulic model to simulate water fluxes in the cor-
called
responding
segment network.
HydroRoot
(https://github.com/openalea/hydroroot), each
elementary root segment is associated with a derivative mi-
crocircuit containing both radial (k) and axial (K) hydraulic
conductances. While the former (k) accounts for all path-
ways mediating radial water flow, the latter (K) represents
the conductances of the segment xylem vessels (Figure 1C).
Accordingly, each elementary root segment is connected
with the root bathing solution, and with basal and apical
neighboring segments (Figure 1C). Overall, an individual
root is represented as a series of elementary units while root
branching is considered as a derivation in the global circuit
(Figure 1D). Moreover, root tips are considered as terminal
segments, with an elementary radial flow that feeds into the
axial flow of the neighboring segment. In addition, endoge-
nous osmotic driving forces were not taken into account
since spontaneous exudation was close to 0 in our condi-
tions (Boursiac et al., 2005). Thus, the boundary variables of
the hydraulic model are either imposed experimentally [ho-
mogeneous water potential (hydrostatic pressure) in the
bathing solution; root base at equilibrium with atmospheric
pressure] or are measured (outgoing water flow:
Jv(P)).
Based on these principles, HydroRoot can be run through a
two-pass algorithm throughout the RSA, as previously de-
scribed on aerial branching structures (Prusinkiewicz et al.,
2007): equivalent conductances of the different branches are
first computed in a backward pass (from root tips to base),
followed by a forward pass (from root base to tips) comput-
ing the water potentials at each point of the root system.
Due to the lack of capacitive components, water fluxes en-
tering each elementary unit through radial or axial transport
are equilibrated by the out-going axial flux toward the root
base. The set of model parameters is recapitulated in
Supplemental Table S1.

Parameterization of axial conductance (K) for
deduction of root radial conductivity (k)
To parameterize axial conductances, xylem vessel number
and size were sampled along the axis of primary, first and
second-order lateral roots of five independently grown Col-0
plants. Supplemental Figure S1A shows typical xylem differ-
entiation patterns from root tip to base. Xylem conductance
was computed according to Hagen–Poiseuille law applied to
the general case of elliptic conduits and implemented
according to vessel number and size in each elementary
unit, thereby providing a conductance profile along the root
axis (Supplemental Figure S1B). Because it is linked to the
fourth power of vessel radius, K shows a dramatic increase
(4600-fold) from root tip to base. We found no clear dis-
tinction between K profiles, in terms of shape and magni-
tude, among different root orders and plants. Thus, a
unique K profile derived from experimental data by locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing (lowess) was applied along
all root axes (Supplemental Figure S1B).

The direct determination of k is, at present, experimen-
tally not achievable in species with highly branched and tiny
roots such as Arabidopsis, as it would require to measure ra-
dial flows in root segments between consecutive branching
points ((cid:2)2 mm in the present case) (Meunier et al., 2018).
We therefore estimated radial conductance values by inverse
modeling, using the RSA and outgoing water flow [Jv(P)]
data determined in the 10 plants described above.
Considering that k is constant from the root base to tips, its
value was determined in individual plants, as presented in
Table 1, and ranged from 3.4 to 22.1 10–8 m s–1 MPa–1, with
an average of 10.4 ± 2.0 10–8 m s–1 MPa–1 (±SE).

Concomitant determination of axial and radial
conductances by model inversion
Although based on well-established physical principles, the
calculation of K presented above overlooks the finite length
of xylem vessels and neglects possible hydraulic limitations
occurring during water passage between adjacent vessels or
at root branching sites (Shane et al., 2000). Previous authors
have also found discrepancies between calculated and mea-
sured axial conductance (Frensch and Steudle, 1989; Tixier
et al., 2013; Bouda et al., 2018). Here, we refined our ap-
proach to simultaneously determine axial and radial conduc-
tances by model inversion in individual and real RSAs. For
this, we characterized root systems that were sequentially
sectioned at a given distance from their bases. The overall
S2A.
procedure
Figure 2, A and B,
illustrates a series of pressure chamber
measurements obtained after successive cuts of a same root
system from the tip toward the base. The successive cuts
create direct hydraulic connections between the cell bath
and xylem lumen, and thereby Jv(P) increases although over-
all root surface area progressively decreases (Supplemental
Figure S2C and Figure 2, A and B). For reference, control in-
tact roots systems that underwent the same successive

pressurization cycles showed a constant Jv(P) (Supplemental
Figure S2B). Unlike previous analyses performed on elemen-
tary root segments (Frensch and Steudle, 1989; Meunier
et al., 2018), the present experimental procedure results in a
complex mix of sections of various root orders, made at the
same distance from the root base, but at varying distances
from their respective tip (Supplemental Figure S2). Thus, we
used a parameter adjustment procedure on HydroRoot run-

multi-parameter adjustment procedure for K, almost inde-
pendent of the first guess parameter values, is displayed in

in which k was set constant in root tips but, due to suberi-

observed upon successive cuts of the RSA, and opening of
vessels, is much more powerful to capture spatial variations
of axial conductance (K) than k.

A general model of Arabidopsis RSA
In order to explore the combined impacts of k, K, and RSA
on root water
transport, we went on to apply the
HydroRoot model to an extended, yet realistic, set of simu-
lated RSAs. Our first step was therefore to develop a general
model of Arabidopsis RSA.

To do this, we first explored the organizing principles of
Col-0 RSA by observing primary and first and second order
lateral roots in a set of 13 individual plants. When looking
at the distribution of root branching, we observed that this
process was always initiated between 8 and 40 mm from the
root tip, and then developed at a relatively stable rate,
which was similar between the primary root and the lateral
roots (Figure 3A). Thus, the cumulated number of lateral

roots that have emerged at a given distance of any root tip
can be described by a linear relationship defined by a nude
tip length and a slope determined by the average internode
length.

Next, we investigated the length of lateral roots with re-
spect to their position along the parental axis. The scattered
data indicated a progressive but stochastic growth of laterals
on the bearing axis (Figure 3B). Yet, first-order lateral roots
showed a more pronounced growth than second-order lat-
eral roots at a same distance of their respective parental
root tip. We, therefore, established distinct length laws for
the two orders of lateral roots.

These observations allowed us to deduce the parame-
ters of a root model that can be used to generate RSAs.
Using realistic ranges of nude tip length (between 5 and
35 mm) and average internode length (1–2.75 mm), we
modeled the stochastic process of lateral root branching
by a first-order Markov chain on growing root axes

Figure 3 Organizing principles of Col-0 RSA. A, Proﬁle of lateral formation along the parental root axis. The dots show the cumulated number of
lateral roots formed at the indicated distance from the root tip, in individual primary (black) and ﬁrst order lateral (gray) roots. B, Length of lateral
root as a function of distance to tip of parental root. We observed that the absolute lengths of ﬁrst order lateral roots (i.e. carried by the primary
root) were very similar between plants of a same age, despite the variations in length shown by the primary root. Thus, plotting lateral root length
as a function of the relative distance to the tip of the bearing axis provides a comprehensive description of lateral root length repartition. This rep-
resentation was conserved in second order lateral roots, whose length was referred to the longest ﬁrst-order lateral. (A) and (B) show cumulated
data from 13 individual primary roots (black) and 9 ﬁrst-order lateral roots (gray). C, Representative examples of simulated RSAs in (from left to

(Lucas et al., 2008). In addition, the length of simulated
lateral roots was determined by fitting lateral root length
along parental root axes (Figure 3B). Root diameters
were set for each root order as indicated above. Setting
the primary root length between 4 and 20 cm, we gener-
ated 9,520 RSAs that spanned the whole range of input
parameters. Figure 3C illustrates the diversity of RSAs
that can be generated using this pipeline.

Capturing features of RSAs using patterns of
intercepted roots
In line with the cut-and-flow approach, we noted that phe-
notyping real RSAs by counting the number of roots that
can be sectioned (intercepted) at six distances from their
base (e.g. 80, 60, 45, 30, 20, 10 mm) was at least five times as
fast as a full RSA reconstruction. The latter needs determin-
ing the nude tip length, position, and length of all lateral
roots. By comparison, the number of intercepted roots at a
few given distances from the base seems to be a more ac-
cessible yet informative indicator of RSA. Figure 4A illus-
trates intercept number curves derived from discrete cuts in
real RSAs or from digitized Col-0 RSAs. These curves are
overlapping with analogous intercept number curves, but
derived from simulated RSAs.

Analysis of the full data set showed that cumulated inter-
cepts were significantly correlated to architectural parame-
ters of the root, such as the total root length (Supplemental
Figure S5A). Another feature of these curves is that they cu-
mulate intercept distributions of first and second-order lat-
eral roots thereby capturing a key aspect of root branching
(Figure 4B).

Finally, we wondered about the capacity of a determined
intercept number profile to distinguish between markedly
different RSAs. Supplemental Figure S5B shows a set of sim-
ulated RSAs that share intercept number profiles similar to
those of reference real RSAs. The simulated RSAs were in-
deed very close, although with some variation, in their total
root length (Figure 4C). The overall data establish that inter-
cept number profiles allow to capture some fundamental
features of RSAs.

Sensitivity analysis of root water transport to
architecture and hydraulic parameters
Next, we applied the HydroRoot model to calculate the
sap flow at a driving pressure of 0.3 MPa [Jv(0.3 MPa)] in
our collection of simulated RSAs using three distinct, yet
realistic hydraulic configurations. For this, we selected
three contrasting but uniform k values, all derived from
cut-and-flow experiments, and applied a varying multiply-
ing factor (ax) to the median axial conductivity (K) profile
determined in the same approach (see Figure 2C). Thus,
in addition to an intermediate hydraulic configuration
(mean k value: 32.8 10–8 m s–1 MPa–1; ax = 1), we defined
a low hydraulic (minimal k: 9.9 10–8 m s–1 MPa–1; ax = 0.5)
and a high hydraulic (maximal k: 71.4 10–8 m s–1 MPa–1;
ax = 2) setting. The three sets of simulations derived from

these settings show a large range of Jv(0.3 MPa) values for
RSAs of varying size (surface) and encompass the 20 ex-
perimentally determined Jv(0.3 MPa) values (Figure 5A).

The whole set of simulated RSA was used to explore the
overall sensitivity of root water flow to elementary input ar-
chitectural parameters. A dependency of Jv(0.3 MPa) on pri-
mary root length (Figure 5B) and average internode length
(Figure 5C) can be observed whereas nude tip length
(Figure 5D) had no impact on simulated flow. In the latter
case, this means that the presence or absence of relatively
short lateral roots close to the tip has a negligible impact on
Jv(0.3 MPa). Finally, when the intermediate hydraulic setting
was used, the variation range of all
input architectural
parameters was responsible for a variation of Jv(0.3 MPa) by
about one order of magnitude.

Jv(0.3 MPa) was also dependent on variations in hydraulic
parameters (Figure 6). Using the set of 9,520 simulated RSAs
described above, we observed a positive and slightly saturat-
ing relationship between Jv(0.3 MPa) and k (Figure 6, A and
B and Supplemental Figure S6A). A similar behavior was ob-
served when varying ax values were applied to the whole ax-
ial conductivity (K) profile (Figure 6, A and C and
Supplemental Figure S6B). These behaviors were not inde-
pendent since sensitivity of Jv(0.3 MPa) to k or ax was higher
and the saturation plateau was more pronounced when ref-
to lower values
erence ax or k parameters were set
(Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure S6). Thus, Jv(P) seems
to be co-limited by the radial and axial conductivity in a
large range of values.

The strong dependence of K on vessel diameter, as indi-
cated by Hagen–Poiseuille law,
is usually interpreted to
mean that the small vessels present at root tips are by far
the most limiting (Steudle and Peterson, 1998). To examine
this point in detail, we inspected the spatial variation of sap
flow when a constant reducing factor (ax 5 1) was applied
throughout the K profile. Supplemental Figure S7 illustrates
this approach on a representative RSA. Figure 6D summa-
rizes the results, showing the relative variation of primary
root axial flow at the indicated distance from root tip, under
varying ax values. Although flow sensitivity was the highest
close to root tip, we observed, for moderate axial limitations
(0.5 5 ax 5 1), a pronounced and somewhat comparable
impact of ax variation on axial flow all along the root. Thus,
limitation of axial conductivity appears to be distributed
over the whole primary root length. Since converging flows
in a highly branched architecture may create marked hy-
draulic constraints in basal root sections, we also considered
the simpler case of a cylindrical root harboring the same K
profile as above (dashed lines, Figure 6D). Although axial
flow was less sensitive to axial limitation (ax 5 1) than in
highly branched roots, a flow limitation along the whole
root axis was also observed. These results emphasize the
functional relevance of profiles with increasing K along the
whole root axis, as determined by the cut-and-flow ap-
proach (Figure 2C).

Continuous lines correspond to experimental measurements of two real RSAs entirely digitized while dashed lines correspond to discrete meas-
urements of two other real RSAs. The gray area delineates the whole set of intercept number curves derived from 9,520 simulated RSAs. Data are
presented in a limited range of distances from tip (10–80 mm), to match the discrete experimental measurements. B, Proﬁles of ﬁrst and second
order intercepted lateral roots. Data from a RSA digitized from a real plant showing that the total intercept number curve (orange, continuous)
can be decomposed into three curves representing the primary root (blue, dashed), and the ﬁrst (green, dashed, one dot) and second (magenta,
dashed two dots) order lateral roots. C, Relationship between total root length in 10 individual real plants (pink squares) and their close simulated
RSAs (gray circles), screened by an absolute normalized difference in the intercepts at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 80 mm from the tip. See example in
Supplemental Figure S3B.

We then investigated possible interactions between
hydraulic and architectural parameters
in determining
root water transport capacity (Supplemental Figure S8).

Finally, we investigated the preferential sites of water up-

Figure 6E represents a heatmap of simulated radial inflow (ji,
Figure 1C) throughout a typical RSA. Under intermediate

hydraulic conditions (k = 32.8 10–8 m s–1 MPa–1; ax = 1), the
highest radial flow is observed at the vicinity of the root
base,
in the primary root as well as the first-order lateral
roots (Figure 6E, middle). A similar pattern is observed after
increasing two-fold the axial conductance (ax = 2; Figure 6E,
right). In contrast, water uptake by first-order lateral roots
and downstream roots was strongly reduced under lower
axial conductance (ax = 0.125; Figure 6E, left). When a non-
uniform k profile was used (k was the highest in root tips
and dropped three times to a lower plateau value in the dif-
ferentiated zone; see above), radial inflow was enhanced in
root tips but the remaining spatial pattern was comparable
to that with uniform k (Supplemental Figure S4C). Overall,
these analyses illustrate how the axial conductance can

mine the relative contribution of the root basal and distal
parts to whole root water uptake.

Dissecting the root hydraulic architecture of esk1
mutants
ESKIMO1 (ESK1) is a xylan-specific O-acetyltransferase (Yuan
et al., 2013) which interferes with cellulose fibril organization
and deposition of plant secondary cell walls. As a conse-
quence, esk1 mutants exhibit an irregular xylem (irx) syn-
drome (Lefebvre et al., 2011). Here, we decided to re-
examine the hydraulic defects observed in these mutants
(Lefebvre et al., 2011) with a comprehensive analysis of their
root hydraulic architecture, based on the numerical ap-
inspection of real
proach developed above. Morphological
plants of two allelic mutants of ESK1 (esk1-1, esk1-5) showed
root growth alterations. While primary root growth was not
different between genotypes, the intercept number profiles
based on digitized RSAs of seven esk1-1 plants and seven
esk1-5 plants highlighted, with respect to Col-0, a clear

reduction in root density in the 25–75 mm range from the
base (Figure 7, A and B). This is attributable to a reduction
in length of first-order laterals which translates into a deficit
in second order laterals. Lefebvre et al. (2011) hypothesized
from discrete anatomical cuts of the root that axial conduc-
tance might be reduced in esk1. We then used cut-and-flow
experiments assisted by the HydroRoot model developed
above to further characterize the hydraulic properties of
esk1 roots. The analyses indicated that the median K of
esk1-1 and esk1-5 was markedly reduced compared to Col-0
by factors from 1.6 up to 19.1 along the primary root axis
(Figure 7C). The cut-and-flow approach also allowed us to
estimate k, which, by comparison to Col-0, appeared to be
reduced by 55%–33% in esk1-1 and esk1-5, respectively
(Figure 7D) and by 40% (P = 0.11; Student’s t test) in cumu-
lated data from esk1-1 and esk1-5. Thus, in complement of
an earlier report (Lefebvre et al., 2011), our results suggest
that the loss of ESK1 function impacts not only xylem con-
ductance, but also other determinants of root water trans-
port capacity. More generally, this study shows how our

impacts on the root uptake capacity have not yet been
addressed. By comparison, more elaborate root hydraulic
models exist in other plant species such as maize and lupine
(Lupinus albus) (Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016; Meunier et al.,
2018), which are indeed more amenable than Arabidopsis to

whether its system of thin, highly branched roots is also hy-

Boursiac et al.

and

experimental

Here, we have investigated the organizing principles of
Arabidopsis root hydraulic architecture, using interplay be-
tween
computational modeling
approaches. To ensure a maximal physiological meaning, ex-
perimental measurements and numerical simulations were
performed at a water potential gradient (i.e. 0.3 MPa) consis-
tent with water flows driven by transpiration under stan-
dard growth conditions.
In addition, starting from a fine
characterization of wild-type (Col-0) plants, our study was
extended to possibly encompass a large panel of accessions
and genotypes.

Our major concern was to understand the relative impact
of elementary axial and radial hydraulic parameters on sap
flow. Whereas confrontation of theoretical and experimental
data through model sensitivity analysis remains the most
common approach, there is a restricted number of studies
whereby hydraulic parameters were deduced from inverse
modeling and integration of architectural components
(Doussan et al., 1998b, 2006; Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016;
Meunier et al., 2018; Pascut et al., 2021;). While these earlier
studies relied on functional analyses of individual axial roots
of maize, lupine or Arabidopsis, we describe here a proce-
dure based on cut-and-flow measurements for simultaneous
determination of axial and radial conductance in highly
branched root systems.

Assessing radial conductance
A direct experimental dissection of radial conductance com-
ponents is, at present, not achievable. It would require an
exact knowledge of the water potential across the root sec-
tion and the experimental determination of elementary hy-
draulic conductivities corresponding to different transport
pathways. Even though cell membrane permeability can be
measured using cell pressure probe or protoplast swelling
assays (Hu¨sken et al., 1978; Ramahaleo et al., 1999), all cell
types
experimentations.
Furthermore, the permeability of other components of radial
water transport, such as the apoplast, has not been clearly
determined yet (Buttersack and Basler, 1991). The present
HydroRoot model proposes to synthetize the overall radial
pathway through a single radial conductance (k) value. Here,
we used an inverse modeling scheme similar to those devel-
oped in Arabidopsis and maize (Couvreur et al., 2018;
Pascut et al., 2021) to determine k from RSA, Jv(P), and K. In
a simplified representation of Arabidopsis root anatomy, the
outer tissues can be reduced to three concentric cylinders
(cell layers) corresponding to the epidermis, cortex, and en-
dodermis, with six cellular membranes in series. Cell pressure
probe measurements in Col-0 cortical cells have given a cell
membrane hydraulic conductivity of 1–4 10–6 m s–1 MPa–1
(Boursiac et al., 2008; Sutka et al., 2011). We note that the
order of magnitude of k determined in this work by inverse
modeling (3 10–7 m s–1 MPa–1) fits with one-sixth of this
range,
radial water
transport in the Arabidopsis root is predominantly mediated
through cell membranes (aquaporins) (Tournaire-Roux et al.,
2003).

in agreement with the idea that

Another line of simplification of HydroRoot is that,
in
most of our simulations, k was set constant from the root
tip to base. Besides its simplicity, this hypothesis is sup-
ported by several studies, including a hydraulic dissection of
developing maize roots through segment analysis (Frensch
inversion approach
et al., 1996) and a hydraulic model
(Meunier et al., 2018) in young lateral and seminal roots of
maize and lateral roots of lupine. Yet, plant roots show a
progressive development of endodermal and peridermal bar-
riers (Ranathunge and Schreiber, 2011; Doblas et al., 2017;
Campilho et al., 2020; Calvo-Polanco et al., 2021) and longi-
tudinal variations in aquaporin gene expression (Gambetta
et al., 2013). Measurements of water uptake profiles in lu-
pine or maize roots have also suggested a steady decrease of
k over root length (Doussan et al., 1998b; Zarebanadkouki
et al., 2016). Here, we investigated a two-step radial conduc-
tivity profile with a constant value of 3 k from tip to the ap-
pearance of full suberization and a value of k beyond. Our
simulations indicate that this more realistic k representation
does not impact the main conclusions on axial conductance
(see below) drawn from HydroRoot running with uniform
k values.

Assessing axial conductance
Most often, axial conductance is roughly evaluated using the
Hagen–Poiseuille law and there are only a few instances
where the axial conductance of roots was experimentally de-
termined (Bramley et al., 2009; Frensch and Steudle, 1989;
Meunier et al., 2018). The overall
literature data indicate
that the axial conductance can show a steep increase, from
the root tip along the root axis, and most importantly varies
between plant species, by up to five orders of magnitude
(Meunier et al., 2018).

Here, we investigated the importance of axial conductance
in the context of highly branched root systems. One first
challenge was to develop a method for measuring K profiles
throughout such complex root systems, where axial flow
measurements in individual thin root axes are not feasible.
However, microscopic observations suggested that K profile
may be similar between root orders. This allowed us to re-
duce the problem to only one K profile. The cut-and-flow
approach provided an efficient method, where the impact
of multiple sections in roots of different orders was analyzed
through a complex parameter optimization. We note that,
because of its design, the cut-and-flow approach preferen-
tially captures the features of axial transport and not radial
transport. This is due to the fact that the progressive in-
crease in sap flow observed upon successive cuts, which re-
sult in a progressive decrease in root surface, essentially
reflects xylem vessel opening and suppression of resistance
of corresponding root tips.

Surprisingly, the experimentally determined K profile indi-
cated values that were up to 10 times lower than concomi-
tant estimates using anatomical measurements together
with Hagen–Poiseuille law. Frensch and Steudle (1989) and
Sanderson et al. (1988) also found that the measured values
were two to three times lower than the calculated ones, in

vessel conductance overlook the resistance due to connec-
tions between finite vessel elements, to possible vascular
constrictions at the sites of root ramifications, or xylem sur-
face properties (Sanderson et al., 1988; Shane et al., 2000).
As elegantly modeled by Bouda et al. (2019), the failure of
Hagen–Poiseuille estimates may also be due to the function-
ing of xylem as a network integrating resistive connections
between functional vessels of distinct sizes.

reveal an axial

Here, we further explored the importance of root axial
conductance in a set of RSAs that were built, by extension,
on well-defined parameters captured in real plants. Our
analyses which extend the theoretical study of Bouda et al.
(2018) show that highly branched root systems can show
pronounced axial limitation for water transport. First, JV(P)
showed a typical saturation in long root systems (with pri-
mary root length 414 cm) (Figure 5B) which somewhat
reflects

(Figure 2C). Increased root branching, while increasing the
root surface to the same extent as root length, may not nec-
limitation in the first place
essarily
(Figure 5C). However, spatially defined sensitivity analysis
showed that hydraulic limitation due to xylem transport
can occur along the whole root axis (Figure 6D). This may
typically happen at the base of highly branched RSAs which
convey converging flows from multiple root axes. Thus, al-
though root tips truly represent particular sites for hydraulic
limitation, our analyses show that the hydraulic load is
somewhat spread over the whole root architecture. In other
terms, the large metaxylem vessels present at root bases are
not as oversized as initially claimed (Steudle and Peterson,
1998). A trade-off likely occurs on this trait as big vessels
typically increase vulnerability of vascular tissues to cavita-
tion (Tyree et al., 1994).

The conceptualization of water transport through sequen-
tial radial and axial water transport has somewhat led to in-
dependent estimates and functional analyses of the two
processes. This approach may be misleading as this and a
previous study show that water transport is actually co-
limited by radial and axial conductances
(Figure 6A;
Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016). As a consequence, experimen-
tal determination of either one of
these components
strongly depends on the accuracy by which the other com-
ponent is evaluated or truly measured.
In physiological
terms, our work indicates that real root systems can act on
multiple cues to alter their water capacity. Interestingly, con-
ductivity of the radial pathway can be adjusted over short
or medium term through aquaporin regulation or root su-
berization whereas changes in RSA or vascular structures oc-
cur during much longer (days) adaptive responses of the
root. Yet, these distinct traits have surely to be coordinately
regulated, to ensure that root hydraulic architecture prop-
erly matches the plant’s environmental conditions and de-
velopmental stages. Abscisic acid (ABA) was recently shown

to play such a coordinating role under water stress (Rosales
et al., 2019).

Deciphering complex root phenotypes
Another major focus of our work was to work out the orga-
nizing principles of fully grown Arabidopsis root systems
and dissect their branching properties. First, we showed that
steady-state lateral root formation on a parent axis occurs
over time and space in pretty well determined patterns that
can be characterized using two constant parameters, nude
tip length, and average internode length. Yet, the growth
and arrest of lateral roots appeared as a highly stochastic
process. Overall, this process was encapsulated in specific
length laws thereby defining a complex pattern comprising
several orders of
In addition, our data set
allowed to generate a set of virtual RSAs that covers real
RSAs of distinct Arabidopsis genotypes. Conversely,
it was
critical for us to develop tools that would allow identifying
the branching profiles of specific genotypes. Here, we show
that intercept number profiles allow such kind of rapid and
discriminative overview of RSA organization.

lateral roots.

and architectural phenotyping

Earlier work has shown that defect in ESKIMO1 function
results in xylem collapse. This phenotype was tentatively as-
sociated with a reduced Lpr (Lefebvre et al., 2011). Since
then, ESKIMO1 was shown to function as a xylan-specific O-
acetyl transferase during secondary cell wall synthesis (Yuan
et al., 2013; Grantham et al., 2017). Due to pleiotropic effects
of cell wall alteration, esk1 mutants also show enhanced
ABA accumulation (Lefebvre et al., 2011) and constitutive
defense responses (Escudero et al., 2017), which could both
interfere with tissue hydraulics. Here, we chose esk1 geno-
types as typically complex cases and used our full set of hy-
draulic
and modeling
approaches to revisit their root water uptake properties. In
agreement with early anatomical work on xylem defects in
this genotype, our study provides a quantitative estimate of
reduction in axial conductance. Our analysis also pointed to
a probable decrease in radial conductance (Figure 7D) and
profound changes in root architecture (Figure 7, A and B).
Thus, the reduced water uptake capacity of esk1 results
from more complex root alterations than initially thought.
This example emphasizes the power of model-assisted hy-
draulic phenotyping which will prove extremely valuable in
support of quantitative genetic analyses of root hydraulics
(Shahzad et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2018). Along these lines,
the MECHA model was recently used to infer distinct radial
hydraulic profiles present in maize roots, either wild-type or
with deregulated plasma membrane intrinsic protein 2;5
(Ding et al., 2020).

In conclusion, we have developed a model-assisted pipe-
line for accurate dissection of root hydraulic architectures in
complex, highly branched root systems. While much empha-
sis has been put so far on aquaporin-mediated control of ra-
dial transport, our approach points to the complementary
importance of axial hydraulic conductance. Drawbacks in in-
ferring this conductance from anatomical measurements
and the common idea that it is only limiting in root tips

have led to underestimating its importance. As a conse-
quence, RSA is most often analyzed as the root foraging ca-
pacity for water whereas it can be associated with true
hydraulic limitations. More generally, we have developed
here a toolbox that can be used for dissecting the multiple
root alterations that may interfere with root uptake capac-
ity, in different genotypes (this work) and, by extension, in
various environmental conditions.
In particular, our study
brings key tools to investigate, in Arabidopsis and possibly
other species, the impact on root hydraulic architecture of
environmental factors (e.g. drought) or hormones (e.g. ABA)
acting on xylem differentiation (Ramachandran et al., 2020).

Materials and methods
Plant culture
Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) seeds were surface sterilized (7 min
incubation in 86% [v/v] ethanol and 0.03% [v/v] chlorine
followed by four washes with 70% [v/v] ethanol) and germi-
nated onto a half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium
with 0.9% (w/v) agar in square petri plates. Plates were incu-
bated in a growth chamber with 70% humidity, 16-h light,
21(cid:3)C for germination, and kept vertical for 10 days. Seedlings
were then transferred to a hydroponic culture medium
(1.25 mM KNO3, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM, Ca(NO3)2,
0.5 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM FeEDTA, 50 mM H3BO3, 12 mM
MnSO4, 0.70 mM CuSO4, 1 mM ZnSO4, 0.24 mM MoO4Na2,
and 100 mM Na2SiO3) for 9–10 additional days in the same
growth chamber. Col-0 (N70000), eskimo1-1 (Xin and
Browse, 1998), and eskimo1-5 (SALK_089531) (Bouchabke-
Coussa et al., 2008) plants were used in this study.

Digitalizing of root architectures
Excised root systems were spread out in a Petri dish con-
taining a thin film of water and gently brushed prior to be-
ing digitized at 600–900 ppi with a desktop scanner. Images
were analyzed with ImageJ software. For a given axis, intern-
odes and lateral roots were traced back with straight or seg-
mented lines, which were then saved in the ROI manager.
This procedure was applied for the primary root as well as
each lateral root carrying lateral roots, which resulted in a
table containing the internodes and lateral roots length for
each branched root.

Hagen–Poiseuille law estimate of axial conductance
The axial conductance along a root axis was estimated from
direct observations of xylem vessels, using the Hagen–
Poiseuille law applied to elliptic conduits. Root segments
from the primary root, and first and second-order lateral
roots were sampled every 2 cm, embedded in 7% (w/v) low-
melting agarose and sliced with a vibratome. Slices were
imaged under an optical microscope and xylem vessel
dimensions were measured (Supplemental Figure S1A). Since
vessel sections were not always circular but possibly oblong,
vessel conductance (in m4
s–1 MPa–1) was computed
according to the general formula for elliptic conduit conduc-
tance (Lewis and Boose, 1995):

K ¼

ðp (cid:4) a3 (cid:4) b3Þ
64 (cid:4) g (cid:4) ða2 þ b2Þ

;

where a and b are long and short axis diameters (m), re-
spectively, and g is the viscosity of water (1.10–3 Pa s at
20(cid:3)C). In all cases, a was less than two times b.

Root water transport measurements
Root water transport was measured on de-topped plants
with a set of pressure chambers, as in Javot et al. (2003).
The hypocotyl of an excised root system was inserted
into an adapter and sealed within the pressure chamber
lid seal with silicone (Coltene Whaledent, France). The
root was then placed into the pressure chamber in a
container filled with filtered (20 mm) hydroponic solu-
tion. The adapter was
connected to a flowmeter
(Bronkhorst, France) in order to record the flow of sap
from the hypocotyl. After a first pressurization of 10 min
at 0.35 MPa, three successive flow measurements were
taken at 0.32, 0.16, and 0.24 MPa. A linear fit of the flow-
to-pressure relationship (with 0.92 5 r2 5 0.99) was used
to deduce the sap flow at 0.3 MPa [Jv(0.3 MPa)].

Modeling principles
The HydroRoot model was developed in a Python program-
ming language, as a component of the OpenAlea platform
(Pradal et al., 2008, 2015). HydroRoot uses a MTG (Godin
and Caraglio, 1998) to represent root hydraulic architecture,
which consists of the topology of a root system (branching
positions, root lengths, root radii, etc.) and its hydraulic
structure (local radial and axial conductivities). The RSML
format (Lobet et al., 2015) is used to import and export the
data to/from the HydroRoot model. The model
is open
source and available through its public repository (https://
github.com/openalea/hydroroot).

The hydraulic aspects of HydroRoot consisted in two
main components: the radial water flow between the
bathing solution and the xylem vessels and the axial
transport through the xylem vessels. Following Doussan
et al. (1998a, 1998b), the root was discretized as a net-
work of elementary segments consisting of a microcircuit
containing both radial (ki) and axial (Ki) hydraulic con-
ductances (Figure 1C). The local radial flux was written as
(cid:2)

the length of the elementary segments, respectively. By
analogy with Ohm’s law, both 1/(kiSi) and Li/Ki may be
modeled as electric resistances, and the hydraulic archi-
tecture may be assimilated to an electrical network
(Doussan et al., 1998a; Prusinkiewicz et al., 2007).
According to the boundary conditions (uniform pressure
around the root and atmospheric pressure at its base), we
are able to calculate the equivalent resistance of the net-
work and then calculate the outflow rate. In brief, let us
consider an elementary segment i, with Ri ¼ Li=Ki and
ri ¼ 1= kiSi
Þ as axial and radial resistances, respectively.

By implementing this equation, step by step from the tips,

we end up with an equivalent resistance for the whole net-
work, and as a consequence, an equivalent hydraulic con-
ductance Keq (Prusinkiewicz et al., 2007; Albasha et al.,
2019). The basal outgoing flux (Jv) is then calculated accord-

Cut-and-flow experiments
An entire root system was excised and inserted into a pres-
transport was measured as
sure chamber, and water
explained above, to check for the linearity of the flow-to-
pressure relationship, but with a 10 mm filtered solution. If
correct, the pressure was set to 0.3 MPa and the sap flow
was recorded. After 3–5 min, the pressure was released and
the root system was taken out of the pressure chamber and
laid onto a 12 (cid:4) 12 cm Petri dish filled with filtered hydro-
ponic solution. All roots were stretched and aligned thereby
allowing all longest root tip segments to be sectioned with a
fresh razor blade, at 1–3 cm from the tip of the longest
root. The remaining root system was put back in the pres-
sure chamber at 0.3 MPa and flow measurement resumed
for another 3–5 min. These steps (Supplemental Figure S2)
were repeated three to eight times with the remaining tip
segments of the root system being cut each time according
to the same principle. Sap flow measured at 0.3 MPa for
each cut step was then averaged and plotted against the
cut position on the primary root (see Figure 2B as an
example).

At each step, the released root segments and the remain-
ing basal part of the root were digitized and processed to re-
construct the initial architecture of the measured root
(Supplemental Figure S2). For each cut, roots segments were
sorted in decreasing order of their total
length (segment
length plus the sum of its lateral root length, if any) and po-
sitioned accordingly on the primary root. Due to its diame-
ter, the primary root was easily identified and could be
attributed correctly for each cut. This allowed us to deter-
mine the position of each cut along the primary axis, and
therefore reconstruct the whole RSA.

The final step of the whole procedure consisted in adjust-
ing radial (k) and axial (K) conductances, to fit the sap flow
measured after each cut. As mentioned above, K varies
along each root axis with the distance to the tip. Here, K
was represented as a linear piecewise function of nine points
for an axis length up to 19.75 cm which corresponds to the
longest root among those analyzed for anatomical data
(Figure 2C). K was therefore represented by up to nine
parameters. The radial conductivity k, which is set uniform

constrained the

in our model,
represented an additional parameter.
Consequently, up to 10 parameters had to be adjusted from
a data set of four to nine measurements. The system being
underdetermined, we
first derivative
of K between two consecutive points to a minimum of
–3.10–11 m2 s–1 MPa–1. This negative value represents the
minimum observed on the lowess smoothing (Figure 2C).
The fit was then performed by minimizing the sum of
square of the residuals. The averaged radial conductivity
from ten Col-0 plants (Table 1), kini, and the nine axial
conductance data points from the lowess fit (Figure 2C),
Kini, were set as initial parameters. The most effective proce-
dure was obtained following these steps:

and ar, with lower bounds of 10–20, such that k1 ¼ ar (cid:4) kini and
K1 ¼ ax (cid:4) Kini;

• keeping k1, the axial conductance points were then adjusted (with the
constraint above and with a nonnegative lower bound) from K1, leading
to K2;

• keeping K2, the radial conductivity was then adjusted from k1 without

bounds or constraint, leading to k2;

• the k and K adjustment loop (steps 2 and 3) was repeated until the vari-

ation in radial conductivity falls below 10–10 m s–1 MPa–1.

We used the function optimize.minimize of the SciPy
Python library to perform these minimizations. The minimi-
zations 1 and 2 were done with the default solver according
to bounds and constraints whereas the minimization of the
radial conductivity (step 3) was done with the “Nelder-
Mead” solver. The robustness of the fitting procedure was
eventually tested by starting from different initial parameters
(Supplemental Figure S3).

Statistical analysis
All data sets were obtained in at least four independent bio-
logical repeats (plant cultures) with the indicated total num-
ber of plants. Pairwise comparisons of model parameters
were performed using a Student t test (P 5 0.05).

Accession numbers
Accession number of ESK1 is At3g55990.
