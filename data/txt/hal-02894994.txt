PREMISE: Herbarium specimens represent an outstanding source of material with which to 
study plant phenological changes in response to climate change. The fine-scale phenological 
annotation of such specimens is nevertheless highly time consuming and requires substantial 
human investment and expertise, which are difficult to rapidly mobilize.

METHODS: We trained and evaluated new deep learning models to automate the detection, 
segmentation, and classification of four reproductive structures of Streptanthus tortuosus 
(flower buds, flowers, immature fruits, and mature fruits). We used a training data set of 
21 digitized herbarium sheets for which the position and outlines of 1036 reproductive 
structures were annotated manually. We adjusted the hyperparameters of a mask R-CNN 
(regional convolutional neural network) to this specific task and evaluated the resulting 
trained models for their ability to count reproductive structures and estimate their size.

RESULTS: The main outcome of our study is that the performance of detection and 
segmentation can vary significantly with: (i) the type of annotations used for training, (ii) 
the type of reproductive structures, and (iii) the size of the reproductive structures. In the 
case of Streptanthus tortuosus, the method can provide quite accurate estimates (77.9% of 
cases) of the number of reproductive structures, which is better estimated for flowers than 
for immature fruits and buds. The size estimation results are also encouraging, showing a 
difference of only a few millimeters between the predicted and actual sizes of buds and 
flowers.

DISCUSSION: This method has great potential for automating the analysis of reproductive 
structures in high-resolution images of herbarium sheets. Deeper investigations regarding 
the taxonomic scalability of this approach and its potential improvement will be conducted 
in future work.

Goëau et al.—Fine-grained automated herbarium specimen analysis 

•  2 of 11

Herbaria represent major and unique resources for the study of plant 
phenology over time and space (Willis et al., 2017a; Yost et al., 2018). 
In particular, they provide the only tangible, long-term evidence of 
sustained changes in plant phenology from the beginning of the 19th 
century to the present. Global awareness of climate change has led 
to a renewed interest in herbarium-derived data for the study of cli-
mate-induced shifts in the seasonal cycles of plants (Davis et al., 2015; 
Soltis et al., 2018; Lang et al., 2019). Several recent herbarium-based 
studies have detected changes in the flowering times of many taxa 
over the past century (Primack et al., 2004; Munson and Long, 2017; 
Pearson, 2019a). An important next step is to scale up such studies, 
extending them to much larger taxonomic and geographical ranges, 
to provide more comprehensive analyses of the potential impacts of 
such shifts on plant–pollinator interactions and on the phenological 
properties of entire plant communities.

The  recent  massive  digitization  of  herbarium-derived  infor-
mation  from  around  the  world  has  enabled  a  wide  variety  of  sci-
entists  to  use  it  for  phenological  research  (Soltis,  2017);  however, 
most studies designed to detect sources of variation in the flowering 
times of wild species have classified the phenological status of spec-
imens using qualitative categories, such as the presence/absence of 
flowers, in combination with the day of year of collection to esti-
mate the flowering time of individuals and taxa. This approach has 
revealed variation among species with respect to the sensitivity of 
their flowering times to a variety of climatic parameters (Park and 
Mazer, 2018), but does not control for the notable variation among 
specimens  in  their  precise  phenological  status,  which  may  vary 
from the initiation of flower buds to the production of ripe fruits. 
Only rare experiments (such as CrowdCurio, Willis et al., 2017b) 
have been conducted to provide detailed quantitative counts on all 
specimens of a collection for the purposes of assessing phenological 
change within and between seasons. The power of this approach has 
revealed substantial and unexpected variation in phenological sen-
sitivity across the eastern United States (Park et al., 2019).

Quantitative measures of the phenological status of specimens, 
based on the estimated proportions of buds, flowers, and fruits, are 
particularly useful for the analysis of species with high numbers of 
structures  in  their  inflorescences  and/or  infructescences,  such  as 
species of the Asteraceae (see Pearson, 2019b, for an example of the 
precise phenological status estimation method). In such taxa, quan-
titative assessments of the phenological status of individual plants 
may  help  to  improve  the  explanatory  power  of  pheno- climatic 
models,  but  this  approach  requires  precise  annotations  (such  as 
recording the number of reproductive structures representing dif-
ferent stages of development) in order to accurately estimate pheno-
logical status (cf. Mulder et al., 2017; Love et al., 2019a).

The  precise  and  detailed  counting  of  reproductive  structures 
in  herbarium  images  is  rarely  conducted  and  the  annotation  re-
quires  significant  time  and  expertise  when  performed  by  human 
observers (Brenskelle et al., 2020). Given the time required to re-
cord this information (such as the number and size of buds, open 
flowers,  spent  flowers,  and  immature/mature  fruits)  for  the  tens 
of millions of specimens already digitized, and the millions yet to 
come,  it  will  take  several  decades  to  obtain  this  precise  informa-
tion if we rely solely on manual annotations. A few programs have 
experimented  with  online  collaborative  approaches  (e.g.,  Notes 
from Nature [https://www.zooni verse.org/organ izati ons/md681 35/
notes -from-nature])  for  recording  detailed  phenological  informa-
tion. Other approaches, such as the ones studied by Lorieul et al. 
(2019), have experimented with the use of deep learning techniques 

to  automate  basic  annotations,  such  as  the  presence/absence  of 
flowers and/or fruits, on a scale of several tens of thousands of her-
barium specimens. The promising results reported by Lorieul et al. 
(2019)  led  them  to  focus  on  the  estimation  of  finer  phenological 
information, such as the precise phenophase of a specimen, which 
has contributed to open new ways of automatically determining the 
phenological stage of a specimen using a quantitative metric.

Plant collectors seem to maximize the richness of information of 
the plant specimens that they collect by collecting samples with the 
maximum diversity of botanical structures (including reproductive 
ones). This has several benefits, including (i) facilitating the species 
identification of the specimens, (ii) providing a richer contribution 
to the knowledge of the species’ morphological diversity, and (iii) 
enabling  a  greater  potential  use  of  the  specimen  in  different  re-
search questions. This practice can partially explain why Lorieul et 
al. (2019) reported that, of the 163,233 herbarium specimens sam-
pled  from  three  herbarium  collections  (temperate  to  equatorial), 
79.4%  to  92.7%  showed  currently  reproducing  specimens,  with  a 
much higher proportion of them displaying flowers than fruits.

The numbers of different classes of reproductive structures (e.g., 
buds, open flowers, developing ovaries, and fruits) can be used to 
calculate  a  phenological  index,  a  quantitative  metric  of  the  phe-
nological progression of each specimen based on the proportions 
of  distinct  reproductive  structures.  This  metric  has  been  used  by 
Mulder  et  al.  (2017)  and  Love  et  al.  (2019a).  Love  et  al.  (2019a) 
demonstrated that the inclusion of this metric as an independent 
variable improves the explanatory power of pheno-climatic models 
designed to detect the effect of climate on flowering date, primarily 
because the metric itself explains a good deal of variance in the date 
of  specimen  collection  (i.e.,  phenologically  advanced  specimens 
tend to be those collected at relatively late dates in the year).

The large-scale, precise, rapid, and automated detection and iden-
tification of reproductive structures in herbarium specimens would 
likely  greatly  increase  the  use  of  herbarium  collections  in  climate 
change studies. To our knowledge, no approach in the scientific lit-
erature has attempted to automate locating, segmenting, and count-
ing distinct types of reproductive structures in digitized herbarium 
specimens.  Here,  we  aim  to  fill  this  gap  by  evaluating  the  use  of  a 
state-of-the-art instance segmentation approach, called mask R-CNN 
(regional convolutional neural network, He et al., 2017), for recording 
the phenological information of the reproductive structures borne by 
Streptanthus tortuosus Kellogg (Brassicaceae). This species, native to 
California, is well-suited for this study due to (i) its relatively small 
size, which allows for entire plants (or a significant portion of them) 
to be preserved on a single herbarium sheet; (ii) its strong visual sim-
ilarity  to  congeners,  facilitating  the  application  of  the  methods  de-
veloped here to a larger taxonomic scale (i.e., within the genus); and 
(iii) the clear phenotypic differences among its distinct reproductive 
phases,  which  include  closed  buds,  open  flowers,  immature  fruits, 
and ripe fruits. The clear differences between developmental stages 
provide two benefits. First, they promote consistent scoring among 
human observers, which leads to high-quality training data sets, and 
second, they facilitate the discrimination among organ types by ma-
chine learning algorithms and the resulting quantitative assessment 
of  each  specimen’s  phenological  status.  In  addition,  the  species  (as 
well as the genus as a whole) is of great interest to botanists because 
it is widely distributed across latitudinal, longitudinal, and elevation 
gradients. Consequently, it is highly suitable for use in phenoclimatic 
models designed to detect the effects of extrinsic factors (e.g., climate, 
soil type) on the onset and duration of flowering (Love et al., 2019a).

Goëau et al.—Fine-grained automated herbarium specimen analysis 

•  3 of 11

Our study was designed to compare the impact of different meth-
odological  approaches  toward  training  deep  learning  models  for 
instance segmentation. In particular, we evaluate the performance 
of the model based on three types of annotation (points masks, par-
tial masks, and full masks), all performed on the same herbarium 
data set. The strengths and constraints of each type of annotation 
are assessed and discussed, and we offer recommendations for the 
generalization of these methods to other taxonomic groups or to a 
larger taxonomic scale. Moreover, we  evaluate  the  applicability of 
the best approach for two concrete analysis tasks: (i) automatically 
counting the number of each reproductive structure per sheet, and 
(ii) automatically estimating their average size per sheet.

METHODS

Data sets

To evaluate the performance of the mask R-CNN approach on dif-
ferent  types  of  annotations,  we  produced  three  different  training 
sets, all of them obtained from the same initial data set of imaged 
and  hand-scored  herbarium  specimen  sheets  produced  by  Love 
et al. (2019b). The input images were resized such that the longest 
edge was 2048 pixels and the shorter one was 1024 pixels in order 
to have sufficient numbers of pixels comprising small objects such 
as  the  buds.  These  three  training  data  sets  are  each  based  on  one 
of three methods for producing annotations of reproductive struc-
tures.  The  first  training  set  (“PointsMask”)  is  based  on  the  proto-
col designed by Love et al. (2019a) to score and record the number 
of  reproductive  structures  representing  successive  developmen-
tal  stages  on  imaged  herbarium  specimens 
using  the  plugin  Cell  Counter  (https://
imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugi ns/cell-count  er. 
html), developed for the image  analysis  soft-
ware ImageJ (Abramoff, 2004). It is important 
to  note  that  this  protocol  was  not  developed 
to produce labeled data for training machine 
learning algorithms; rather, it was designed for 
use in manual organ counting. To score each 
specimen, the annotator (N.L.R.L., S.J.M., and 
two  collaborators)  placed  a  digital  colored 
marker near the distal extremity or at the cen-
ter of each visible reproductive structure; each 
type of organ (buds, flowers, immature fruits, 
mature  fruits)  was  indicated  by  a  distinct 
marker. The scoring of each specimen was vi-
sually  checked  for  accuracy  by  N.L.R.L.,  and 
any  incorrectly  categorized  organs  were  cor-
rected  before  using  the  markers  to  construct 
visual  masks.  For  each  point,  we  produced  a 
small square (3 × 3 pixels) mask (i.e., a shape 
file) close to the top of the recorded reproduc-
tive structure (Fig. 1A).

corresponds to a real size of 0.84 cm and represents a good compro-
mise to capture small organs such as buds and flowers while avoiding 
introducing too much background for large organs such as fruits. This 
allowed us to automatically capture preliminary masks of each anno-
tated reproductive structure (as illustrated in Figs. 1,  2B, and 3).

The third training set (“FullMask”) (illustrated in Figs. 1,  2C) 
contains only manually annotated masks and was much more time 
consuming to create. This data set, produced by two of the coauthors 
(H.G. and P.B.), was cross validated between these two people. We 
uploaded  entire  images  of  herbarium  specimens  and  their  partial 
masks  into  COCO  Annotator  (https://github.com/jsbro ks/ coco-
annot ator)  (Fig.  4),  a  web-based  tool  for  object  segmentation,  in 
order to manually draw the full outline of each reproductive struc-
ture. This allowed us to capture the full shape of each reproductive 
organ identified on each specimen. When structures overlapped on 
the specimen, only the structure in the foreground was annotated, 
resulting in the exclusion of background structures from the seg-
mentation in that part of the image. A total of 1036 reproductive 
structures  from  21  herbarium  specimens  were  annotated.  Details 
for each reproductive structure are provided in Table 1.

The test set contains 10 images annotated with the same meth-
odology  used  for  the  FullMask  training  set,  thus  totaling  678 
reproductive structures (see Table 1 for details). It is difficult to 
precisely indicate the annotation effort in terms of duration, but 
we estimated that, on average, it took one minute to edit a mask 
and  the  label  of  a  reproductive  structure.  Figure  1C  illustrates 
the  precision  needed  to  produce  these  FullMask  training  data 
for  the  four  studied  reproductive  structures.  It  is  important  to 
remember  that  these  illustrations  were  chosen  for  their  clarity, 
but  individual  reproductive  structures  are  not  always  so  clearly

The second training set (“PartialMask”) is 
an extension of the Points training data set and 
includes the partial segmentation of reproduc-
tive  structures.  We  applied  the  classical  Otsu 
segmentation  method  (Otsu,  1979)  within 
each 100 × 100-pixel box centered on the ini-
tial  colored  markers.  The  value  of  100  pixels

visible (e.g., when structures overlap or have deteriorated), which 
greatly  increases  the  time  required  to  annotate  each  specimen. 
Considering an average of 60 reproductive structures per image, 
and  that  an  average  of  one  hour  was  required  to  annotate  each 
herbarium specimen image, about 30 hours were spent annotat-
ing the 31 images of the training and test sets.

Evaluated deep learning framework

Our fine-grained detection method is based on the mask R-CNN 
architecture  (He  et  al.,  2017),  which  was  chosen  for  its  robust-
ness  and  demonstrated  efficiency  in  instance  segmentation  tasks

and  challenges  such  as  MS  COCO  (Microsoft  Common  Objects 
in  Context;  Lin  et  al.,  2014).  We  used  Facebook’s  mask  R-CNN 
benchmark (Massa and Girshick, 2018) implemented with Pytorch 
(Paszke  et  al.,  2017).  We  chose  ResNet-50  as  the  backbone  CNN 
and  the  Feature  Pyramid  Networks  (Lin  et  al.,  2017)  for  instance 
segmentation. The selection of the number of training epochs was 
made  based  on  the  empirical  observation  of  the  model’s  training 
performance.  A  detailed  description  of  the  hyperparameters  that 
were used to train the model is provided in Appendix 1.

and Mature Fruits), two additional metacate-
gories were considered for performing a sec-
ondary CP metric: Buds_Flowers (the sum of 
the numbers of Buds and Flowers) and Fruits 
(the sum of the numbers of Developing Fruits 
and Mature Fruits).

Average  precision  at  fixed  intersection  over 
union value—This is a common metric used to 
evaluate the accuracy of instance segmentation 
tasks, particularly in the context of the popular 
MS  COCO  challenge  (http://cocod ataset.org/# 
detec tion-eval)  (Lin  et  al.,  2014).  First,  all  the 
candidate detections that have sufficient overlap 
with each object in the ground truth are deter-
mined.  This  is  done  by  computing  the  union 
and  intersection  of  the  object’s  masks  (actual 
and predicted) and retaining only the predicted 
masks that have an intersection over union (IoU) 
value above a fixed threshold value (in our case, 
IoU > 50%). A visual illustration of the IoU for 
a  flower  of  Streptanthus  tortuosus  is  provided 
in Fig. 5. Second, for a given class (i.e., a given 
type of reproductive structure in our case), all of 
the remaining matches are sorted by decreasing 
confidence  score  of  the  prediction  (i.e.,  by  the 
maximum probability of the softmax output of 
the classifier). Finally, the average precision (AP) 
is computed from that sorted list as follows:

Description of experiments

Based on the predicted and expected reproductive structures of the 
images in the test set, we computed the following measurements:

Counting precision—This metric aims to evaluate the ability of the 
proposed approach to automatically count the number of reproduc-
tive structures present on herbarium sheets. It is defined for a given 
sheet  and  type  of  reproductive  structure  as  the  ratio  between  the 
number of manually annotated instances (considered to be the “true 
count”) and the number of automatically detected ones. A counting 
precision (CP) higher than 100% means that the automated count 
is overestimated. A CP lower than 100% means that the automated 
count  is  underestimated.  Complementary  to  the  four  types  of  re-
productive  structure  categories  (Buds,  Flowers,  Immature  Fruits, 

where Ngt is the number of object instances in 
the ground truth, 𝛿( ⋅ ) is an indicator function 
equal  to  1  if  the  predicted  label  of  the  detected  object  is  equal  to 
the ground-truth label, and P(k) is the precision measured over the 
top-k results (i.e., the number of correct matches in the k first de-
tections divided by k).

Size-wise  AP—This  is  the  AP  computed  on  instances  categorized 
by their size: (i) Small (1–64 pixels maximum bounding box size), 
(ii) Medium (65–128 pixels maximum bounding box size), and (iii) 
Large (>128 pixels). In centimeters, this corresponds to 0.01–0.54 
cm for Small, 0.55–1.08 cm for Medium, and >1.08 cm for Large.

Detection and confusion probability matrix—This matrix gives the 
probability of detecting a mask of a particular reproductive struc-
ture and the probability of misclassifying it as another reproductive 
structure. It was computed based on the best match of each mask 
with respect to its prediction score (i.e., the softmax output).

Measurement statistics—Box  plots  are  used  to  graphically  repre-
sent the length of the reproductive structures to assess the ability of 
the proposed approach to automatically estimate the size of repro-
ductive structures in the herbarium sheets. The size of each instance 
is defined as the diagonal length of the bounding box surrounding 
the mask of the instance. We considered the same types of repro-
ductive structures as for the CP metric.

above a fixed threshold value of 50% were used in the final analysis. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

Measurement precision—This quantitative metric aims to evaluate 
the  ability  of  the  proposed  approach  to  automatically  estimate  the 
size of reproductive structures in the herbarium sheets. For a given 
sheet and type of reproductive structure, the measurement precision 
is defined as the ratio between the average size of the manually anno-
tated instances in the sheet and the average size of the automatically 
detected ones. The size of each instance is defined as the diagonal 
length of the bounding box surrounding the mask of the instance. 
A  measurement  precision  higher  than  100%  means  the  true  aver-
age size is overestimated. A measurement precision lower than 100% 
means  the  true  average  size  is  underestimated.  We  considered  the 
same types of reproductive structures as for the CP metric.

RESULTS

Comparison of the three models for counting reproductive 
structures

The comparisons of the CP achieved by the three learned models are 
presented in Fig. 6 for, respectively, all reproductive structures (Fig. 
6A), the Buds_Flowers and Fruits categories (Fig. 6B), and each re-
productive structure separately (Fig. 6C). The model with the best CP 
on average was the R-CNN-FullMask, i.e., the model that was trained 
on the full masks drawn manually. Its average CP was equal to 77.9% 
of the true number of reproductive structures whereas the CPs of the 
R-CNN-PartialMask  and  R-CNN-PointsMask  models  were  125.1% 
and 55.6%, respectively. In addition to these average values, Fig. 6A 
shows that the CP of the R-CNN-FullMask model was much more 
stable than the other models. It tended to underestimate the counts, 
but  always  by  the  same  proportion.  Thus,  it  would  be  very  easy  to 
correct  this  bias  by  applying  a  multiplicative  calibration  factor.  On 
the contrary, the variance of the CP of the two other models is much 

higher,  thus  even  a  calibration  would  not  be  sufficient.  Figure  6B 
shows that the R-CNN-FullMask CP is more stable across the Fruits 
and the Buds_Flowers categories. In contrast, the two other models 
behave differently for each category and have a much higher variance.
The  results  obtained  for  each  reproductive  structure  (Fig.  6C) 
confirm  this  trend,  but  also  show  that  the  performance  of  the 
R-CNN-FullMask differed among the different types of reproductive 
structures. On average, it was less biased when counting Immature 
Fruits (average CP = 95.5%) and Buds (average CP = 86.3%), but in 
terms of stability, it performed better on Flowers and Mature Fruits. 
Appendix S1 provides details of the ground truth and the obtained 
results of the three learned models for the count of each reproduc-
tive structure, in each image of the test set.

Detailed analysis of the detection performance of the R-CNN-
FullMask model

Given  that  the  R-CNN-FullMask  model  exhibited  the  most  ac-
curate CP, we conducted a more detailed analysis of its detection 
performance.  In  particular,  Fig.  7A  reports  its  AP  for  detecting 
each type of reproductive structure at IoU = 50% and Fig. 7B dis-
plays the detection and confusion probability matrix. Both figures 
show that the type of reproductive structure most accurately de-
tected  was  Flowers,  followed  by  Mature  Fruits,  Immature  Fruits, 
and Buds. This is consistent with the CP experiment, in which the 
most stable counts were achieved for Flowers. Not all flowers were 
detected, but the percentage of detected ones is quite stable across 
all herbarium specimens so that a multiplicative calibration factor 
could be used to generate accurate counts. On the contrary, Buds, 
Immature Fruits, and Mature Fruits seem to be more difficult to 
detect,  mainly  because  of  a  high  rate  of  misdetection  and  false 
alarms (misclassifications are relatively rare, so they cannot explain 
the low AP values).

except in the case of immature fruits, which 
remain  very  difficult  to  detect  and  segment 
accurately. Indeed, the variance of the predic-
tion for immature fruits is the highest among 
all  reproductive  structures,  particularly  for 
those that are longer than 3 cm, probably be-
cause their visual appearance is very similar 
to that of mature fruits. Figure 8B shows the 
Measurement  Precision  and  highlights  the 
overestimation  of  sizes  for  Immature  Fruits 
and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  for  Buds,  while  the 
variance  is  relatively  low  for  Mature  Fruits 
and  Flowers.  Mature  fruits  in  particular 
would be the best reproductive structures to 
automatically detect in a larger data set using 
the current R-CNN-FullMask model for con-
ducting  phenological  studies  based  on  fruit 
size and the date of maturity.

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this work was to develop and 
test an instance segmentation method for the 
fine-scaled  detection  of  different  reproduc-
tive  structures  in  herbarium  specimens.  In 
particular,  the  aim  was  to  evaluate  the  per-
formances of models based on different types 
of training data. For the best of these models 
(i.e., R-CNN-FullMask), we further aimed to 
precisely  analyze  its  potential  for  counting, 
detecting, and measuring reproductive struc-
tures in order to facilitate new ways to con-
duct phenological studies on natural history 
collections.

Figure 7C displays the size-wise AP (still at IoU = 50%), reveal-
ing that the size of the reproductive structures has a strong impact 
on performance. Reproductive structures more than 1.52 cm long 
(i.e., the Large category in Fig. 7C) were detected with an AP of 0.4, 
while structures less than 0.76 cm long were detected with an AP of 
0.2; the highest value of AP (0.44) was obtained for medium-sized 
structures. It is important to remember that the hyperparameters of 
our model have been chosen in such a way as to cover all sizes of the 
objects present. The higher probability of misdetection of the small-
est objects is thus likely to be due to a bias rather than a problem 
of resolution. This will have to be explored more deeply in further 
work.

Evaluating the performance of the R-CNN-FullMask model for 
measuring the size of reproductive structures

Figure 8A shows the boxplot of the true and estimated object’s size 
for each type of reproductive structure. This figure displays the box-
plot  of  the  Measurement  statistics  and  shows  that  quite  accurate 
measurements  can  be  achieved  for  most  reproductive  structures, 

One  main  outcome  of  this  study  is  that 
deep  learning  technologies  such  as  mask 
R-CNN  models  are  highly  influenced  by  (i) 
the  type  of  training  data  on  which  they  are 
developed, (ii) the type of reproductive struc-
ture  targeted,  and  (iii)  organ  size.  Indeed,  although  points  masks 
are the most quickly produced by annotators compared with par-
tial masks or full manual masks, they are much less efficient for the 
automated  counting  of  reproductive  structures.  Nevertheless,  our 
study has shown that points masks can be useful to produce partial 
masks based on an automated segmentation approach within a win-
dow generated around each point, which can significantly increase 
the performance of models trained from these raw data. Full masks 
clearly provide the most efficient training data, as they can capture 
the  full  visual  information  associated  with  all  the  reproductive 
structures present on several different herbarium specimens.

This study has clearly shown that a mask R-CNN based on full 
masks  has  the  potential  to  reliably  contribute  to  the  detection, 
counting, and measurement of some of the reproductive structures 
targeted. Flowers seem to be the most accurately captured, as (i) they 
are  much  larger  than  buds,  (ii)  they  are  more  isolated  than  buds, 
which are often aggregated in a cluster at the tip of inflorescences, 
and (iii) they overlap less with other plant structures in Streptanthus 
tortuosus, in contrast to its frequently overlapping long thin fruits. 
This  is  an  important  result,  as  we  know  from  the  cross-herbaria

analysis of Lorieul et al. (2019) that herbarium specimens are of-
ten collected in flower; for example, among the specimens from the 
New  England  Vascular  Plant  collection  (https://www.idigb io.org/
wiki/index.php/Mobil izing_New_Engla nd_Vascu lar_Plant_Speci 
men_Data)  and  Florida  State  University’s  Robert  K.  Godfrey 
Herbarium (Tallahassee, Florida, USA) used in Lorieul et al.’s (2019) 
study, 64.9% and 73.9% bore flowers, respectively.

The  influence  of  organ  size  on  the  automated  detection  and 
identification of reproductive structures is a key issue to take into 
account; there is a real need to improve the analysis of small struc-
tures  in  such  visual  collections.  A  potential  solution  could  be  to 
work with higher-resolution images, which was not possible in our 
study due to computational resource limitations. The impact of or-
gan size identified here (i.e., the lowest AP value obtained for small 
structures)  is  important  as  it  indicates  that  this  approach  will  be 
more  efficient  on  taxa  bearing  relatively  large  reproductive  struc-
tures. Clades characterized by such traits (e.g., large-flowered and 
large-fruited  Fabaceae,  Onagraceae,  Brassicaceae)  could  be  much 
more suitable for this type of analysis. Similarly, taxa with loosely 
arranged  inflorescences  or  singly  borne  flowers  (instead  of  dense 
ones) will be relatively easier to analyze.

Other key issues are the  capacity  to  take  into  account the  high 
variability of some of these reproductive structures, such as imma-
ture fruits, which are highly diverse in terms of size, shape, color, and 
texture. Potential improvements to address these constraints could 
include the use of much larger training data sets, notably in terms of 
the number of each type of reproductive structure. This could allow 
such training data sets to sample a much larger diversity of develop-
ment stages, from closed buds to ripe fruits, with greater intensity. It 
is important to recall that the performance metrics reported here are 
based on a rather small training data set comprising 21 herbarium 
specimens. Thus, the performance could be considerably enhanced 
by enriching the data set, for example with specimens from different 
ecosystems, collected at different periods of the year, and conserved 
for different durations. In particular, this could potentially improve 
our model’s robustness and generalization capability, thereby allow-
ing its use with other Streptanthus species. The use of complemen-
tary training data representing other species or structures (such as 
leaf or stem masks) could also be beneficial for the transfer of learn-
ing strategies that have already proved their efficiency for other her-
barium visual classification tasks (Carranza-Rojas et al., 2017).

Other computation techniques could also contribute to the im-
provement  of  model  performance.  Indeed,  the  masks  themselves 
are computed by thresholding a local heatmap, an image whose in-
tensity is proportional to the likelihood that the pixel belongs to the 
detected object. This thresholding of the heatmap can be seen as a 
loss of information, and it could be much more efficient to optimize 
the treatment directly from the set of heatmaps rather than the set 
of masks. This could be used, for example, to select masks with a 
very high score of confidence for measurement analysis, instead of 
trying to measure all detected structures, even those with low con-
fidence scores. Model combination is also a promising solution that 
has  yielded  performance  improvement  for  other  visual  biological 
classification tasks (as in the study of Goëau et al., 2017). This is a 
computation method that consists of training multiple models in-
stead of a single model and then combining the predictions gener-
ated by these models. This method, also called “ensemble learning,” 
can be done with many different computational and statistical strat-
egies and usually improves results by generating predictions that are 
more accurate than those produced by any single model.

We chose to evaluate the use of the mask R-CNN approach, al-
ready used in other biological contexts (e.g., Champ et al., 2020), as it 
has the advantage of allowing the detection, counting, and potential 
measurement  of  detected  structures  within  a  single  model.  Other 
approaches  could  be  evaluated,  such  as  the  strategy  presented  by 
Chattopadhyay et al. (2017), where the counting task is divided into 
easier and smaller object detection tasks on subsections of images. 
DeepSetNet (Rezatofighi et al., 2017) is an alternative technique that 
simultaneously detects and counts objects trained with the labels of 
the true count. Seguı et al. (2015) trained models using only the true 
count on the global image. Some of the most popular approaches are 
based on a “density” method (Arteta et al., 2016; Boominathan et al., 
2016). In this method, models are trained on the annotation of object 
centers, on which a density map is then computed and integrated to 
obtain a count value. All of these approaches could greatly enrich our 
capacity to report the presence and abundance of reproductive struc-
tures in herbarium collections, and without doubt could contribute 
to enlarging the huge research potential of these invaluable collec-
tions. Combined with other machine learning techniques (such as in 
the studies of Meineke et al., 2020; Ott et al., 2020; Pryer et al., 2020; 
Weaver et al., 2020; White et al., 2020), they could largely increase the 
benefits of using the newly digitized herbarium data sets.

Input image size—Images are resized such that the longest edge is 
2048 pixels and the shorter one is 1024 pixels, in order to have suffi-
cient pixels related to small objects such as the buds (by default the 
mask R-CNN implementation used here considers a longest edge of 
1024 pixels and a shorter one of 600 pixels).

Anchor size and stride—Anchors are the raw regions of inter-
est used by the region proposal network to select the candidate 
bounding  boxes  for  object  detection.  We  chose  their  size  to 
guarantee that the targeted objects have their size covered. The 
anchor  size  values  were  set  to  [32;64;128;256;512],  the  anchor 
stride values to [4;8;16;32;64], and the anchor ratios to [0.5;1;2].

Non-maximal  suppression—The  non-maximal 
suppression 
(NMS)  quantifies  the  degree  of  overlap  tolerated  between  two 

distinct  objects  (set  to  0.5,  the  default  value  in  the  mask  R-CNN 
implementation used here).

The  training  of  the  model  was  run  on  an  NVidia  Geforce 
RTX  2080  Ti  (NVidia  Corporation,  Santa  Clara,  California, 
USA)  using  stochastic  gradient  descent  with  the  following 
parameters: batch size of 3, total number of epochs set to 10,000, 
and  learning  rate  of  0.01.  We  trained  our  model  for  several 
periods of time and stopped training when the loss converged or 
stopped decreasing. More specifically, we use a technique called 
the  “Panda  approach,”  in  which  all  training  parameter  choices 
were  made  on  the  basis  of  the  empirical  observation  of  the 
model’s training performance. We use a warmup strategy, where 
the  learning  rate  increases  linearly  from  0.005  to  0.01  during 
the  first  five  epochs.  To  improve  robustness  and  minimize  the 
variance of the model, we applied a large set of data augmentation 
techniques, including random horizontal, random rotations, and 
random variations on color contrast, saturation, brightness, and 
hue color values.
