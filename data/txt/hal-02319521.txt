Abstract Motivated by its implications in the development of general purpose
solvers for decomposable Mixed Integer Programs (MIP), we address a funda-
mental research question, that is to assess if good decomposition patterns can be
consistently found by looking only at static properties of MIP input instances, or
not. We adopt a data driven approach, devising a random sampling algorithm,
considering a set of generic MIP base instances, and generating a large, balanced
and well diversiﬁed set of decomposition patterns, that we analyze with machine
learning tools. The use of both supervised and unsupervised techniques highlights
interesting structures of random decompositions, as well as suggesting (under cer-
tain conditions) a positive answer to the initial question, triggering at the same
time perspectives for future research.

1 Introduction

General purpose Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solvers have been developed
for decades from both theoretical, algorithmic and software engineering points
of view. There is indeed a huge interest in making such tools more and more
eﬀective, the primary one being their ease of integration in real world decision
support systems [4, 5, 6].

Fig. 1 Structure of a MIP with diagonal blocks (black) and border (grey).

All state-of-the-art solvers currently rely on complex methods mounted on
branch-and-cut frameworks, where Linear Programming (LP) relaxations are used
to produce initial dual bounds, that are subsequently strengthened by cutting
planes [2]. On the one hand such a paradigm oﬀers eﬃciency and stability, coming
from a deep computational understanding built over the years; on the other hand,
such a structure yields to drawbacks that show to be very hard to overcome by
simply plugging in additional techniques.

A key one is related to the structure of models: while on the majority of the
cases generic cutting procedures are very eﬀective, on a few classes of combinatorial
optimization problems the initial LP dual bounds are too poor to drive the full
method. A second weakness is related to the structure of algorithms, preventing
them to scale eﬀectively as the amount of available computing resource increases,
for instance thanks to multi-core or distributed computing capabilities.

To overcome these drawbacks, at least when well-structured combinatorial op-
timization problems need to be optimized, researchers have started to investi-
gate alternative paradigms. One of them is Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition applied
to integer programs (DWD): on applications like vehicle routing, crew schedul-
ing, cutting stock, facility location, generalized assignment, and many others [13],
DWD-based techniques proved to be far superior to branch-and-cut. In fact, mod-
els for these applications exist, having as common structure a constraint matrix
in a so-called bordered block-diagonal form (see Figure 1). DWD is able to disag-
gregate these problems in a master entity, involving only constraints and variables
in the border, and one or more subproblems, one for each diagonal block. DWD
can then be paired with column generation techniques [1] to obtain dual bounds
that are potentially much tighter than the LP relaxation of the original model
in reasonable computing time. Furthermore, these column generation techniques
prove to scale very well as the amount of computing resources increases [22].

DWD has however, one fundamental issue preventing it to be applied as gener-
ically as cutting planes: decomposition patterns must be provided by the modeler,
and such a task requires deep mathematical programming skills. That is why,
although many positive results have been obtained by problem-tailored DWD ap-
proaches, very few attempts have been made in the literature to tackle MIPs with
generic DWD methods.

All of them aim at analyzing a MIP, understanding whether a suitable struc-
ture can be detected, and automatically performing DWD and column generation.
A few research threads can be surveyed in the literature. The ﬁrst one considers
to explicitly enrich the input, asking the user both a MIP instance (as in current

Random Sampling and Machine Learning to Understand Good Decompositions

3

branch-and-cut based general purpose solvers), and a decomposition pattern de-
scribing the block structure to be exploited. DWD is then applied automatically.
Approaches along this line include [14], [16] and [15]. In [9] a full generic column
generation framework is introduced, which is currently engineered and released
with the SCIP framework [10]. Since ﬁnding suitable decomposition patterns re-
quires very speciﬁc technical expertise, a second research thread is to ask only a
MIP instance as input, and to detect if in that instance speciﬁc previously known
structures occur, which are known to be suitable for DWD. Successful contribu-
tions along this axis are indeed embedded in [9]. A third, more ambitious, thread
is to assume that previously unknown decomposable structure may be found (or
even enforced) in a generic MIP instance provided as input, that can be made evi-
dent through a suitable algorithmic search for good decomposition patterns. Very
recently, the authors of [12] propose to preprocess the input MIP with machine
learning tools, to detect ﬁrst of all if it is amenable for a successful decomposition
approach or not. In [11] and [3] fully automatic frameworks are proposed, obtain-
ing better results than CPLEX [4] on a noticeable set of MIP instances. A common
issue of these approaches is to ﬁnd suitable optimization metrics, exploiting MIP
instance details to score decomposition candidates.

Indeed a fundamental research question remains open, that is to assess if good
decomposition patterns can consistently be found at all by looking only at static
properties of the instance, or not, and possibly to understand which properties are
worth considering.

In this paper we try to step towards the clariﬁcation of this issue with an agnos-
tic approach. That is, we consider generic MIP instances and we generate a large,
balanced and well diversiﬁed set of decomposition patterns. Then we analyze them
with statistical and machine learning tools, with the main aim of understanding
if good ones can be distinguished from others by automatic methods looking only
at the static properties of the corresponding matrices.

We formally employ both supervised and unsupervised learning tools [19] al-
though, whenever possible, we present our methods with an operations research
language and perspective. Indeed using Machine Learning for Integer Program-
ming [24] or vice versa [23], and in general integrating both ﬁelds [25], is a recent
and extremely promising trend.

The paper is organized as follows. First we face the key issue of producing a sig-
niﬁcant dataset, proposing a randomized sampling algorithm (Section 2); we then
perform a preliminary assessment on the properties of such a dataset (Section 3).
Second, we check if simple correlation patterns arise, linking single properties of
the MIP instance to the computational behavior of decompositions (Section 4).
Since no particular pattern is found by this check, we perform more advanced
analyses for ﬁnding out if combinations of MIP instance properties can be used to
eﬀectively predict how good a decomposition is (Section 5). We ﬁnally estimate
which is the impact of exploiting previous knowledge of good and bad decomposi-
tions, both on the same and on diﬀerent MIP instances, in correctly understanding
new decompositions (Section 6). Our research leads to some perspectives, which
are collected in a ﬁnal discussion (Section 7).

– Fix the initial set of blocks to be empty.
– Consider a special border block, which is initially empty.
– At each iteration, assume that a set of blocks has already been created; a new constraint
is chosen at random, with a probability directly proportional to its sparsity, defined as
the number of zeros in the constraint matrix

– if the constraint covers no variable that is covered by other constraints belonging
to existing blocks, then a new block is created, and the constraint is assigned to
that block

– if the constraint covers any variable that is covered by other constraints belonging

to more than one existing block, then the constraint is put in the border

– if the constraint covers variables that are covered by constraints in a single

existing block, and possibly additional variables that are still uncovered, then the
constraint is added to that block.

2 Dataset generation

Our ﬁrst target was the creation of a signiﬁcant and well diversiﬁed dataset, as
a key requirement for our investigation was to have both good and bad decompo-
sition to compare. This task turned out to be diﬃcult: on one hand, drawing a
random decomposition for an arbitrary MIP is very likely to yield unpromising
results; on the other hand, focusing on speciﬁc good decomposition patterns for
known decomposable MIPs would not allow to produce both diversiﬁed positive
and negative examples. Indeed, many of our initial attempts to produce diverse
decompositions failed in either sense, as it was very hard to produce a suﬃciently
large and spread sampling, and make at the same time block diagonal structures
appear in the coeﬃcients matrix; in turn, no block structure basically means a
predictably useless decomposition approach.

We ﬁnally found the following approach to produce meaningful results. We
considered a set of generic base MIP instances (base instances in the remainder),
selecting them from unstructured problems in MIPLIB 2003 [7] and MIPLIB 2010
[8] that, according to [3], might potentially be suitable for a decomposition ap-
proach. The list of our base instances is reported in Section A.1 of the appendix.
These are all stated as minimization problems. For each base instance we generated
1000 random decompositions with the randomized sampling algorithm reported in
Figure 2. It builds blocks of constraints, that in turn induce blocks of correspond-
ing covered variables, that is variables having nonzero coeﬃcients in the constraints
of the block.

The randomized algorithm produces decompositions with a random number
of blocks; we ﬁxed a minimum blocks threshold: when a decomposition was pro-
duced, containing fewer blocks than the threshold we simply repeated the gener-
ation process, until that criterion was met. Such a threshold was ﬁxed to 3 in our
experiments.

Then, each decomposition was analyzed, and a set of features was extracted
by measuring standard properties of both the constraint matrix, the constraints
right hand sides and the objective function coeﬃcients of variables in each block.
A full list of the features is reported in Section A.2 of the appendix. These include
also the quality measures that were employed in the decomposition optimization
algorithms of [3]. We have also introduced a coeﬃcient to estimate how similar
is each block to a totally unimodular matrix: intuitively total unimodular blocks
mean decomposition subproblems possessing the integrality property, and there-

For each block independently

– if any variable of the block contains more than two non-zero entries, return 0.0
– if any entry in the block is different from 0, 1 or −1, return 0.0
– initialize a left and right partition to be empty sets
– initialize a counter k = 0
– iteratively, consider each variable of the block in the order in which they appear in the

base instance:

– if the number of its non-zeros entries in the block is either zero or one, increase k

and iterate

– if the variable has two different entries in the block, corresponding to constraints

assigned to different partitions, increase k and iterate

– if the variable has two equal entries in the block, corresponding to constraints

assigned to the same partition, increase k and iterate

– if the variable has two different (resp. equal) entries in the block, one of which in
a constraint assigned to a certain partition, and the other in a constraint assigned
to no partition yet, assign the second constraint to the opposite (resp. the same)
partition, increase k and iterate

– if the variable has two different (resp. equal) entries in the block, none of which

in a constraint assigned to a partition, choose a random partition, assign the first
constraint to it, and the second constraint to the other (resp. the same) partition,
increase k and iterate

– otherwise simply iterate without increasing k

– return k divided by the total number of variables appearing in the block.

fore yielding no bound improvement in a DWD-like decomposition process. Sets
of conditions being suﬃcient for proving total unimodularity require, for instance,
to ﬁnd a suitable bi-partition of the set of rows [26]: in an eﬀort to obtain a nu-
merical feature, we approximated such a check by means of a randomized greedy
algorithm, whose pseudo-code is reported in Figure 3.

The randomized greedy algorithm was iterated ten times, and the highest value
was retained as ﬁnal coeﬃcient. The coeﬃcient represents the fraction of variables
that have been considered before stopping in a failure status. That is, in the ex-
treme cases, 1.0 means that the corresponding matrix has been proved to be totally
unimodular (that is undesirable for the decomposition process), while 0.0 means
it has been proved not to be totally unimodular.

Afterwards, we ran a simulation on each decomposition, experimentally solving
the continuous relaxation of the corresponding extended formulation, that is com-
puting the corresponding dual bound at the root node of a branching tree. Such a
simulation was carried our by means of the generic column generation procedure of
GCG [9] from the SCIP framework [10], excluding all preprocessing, cut generation
and problem reduction procedures, and activating IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.6.3 [4] to
solve LPs. Bash and Python scripts were used to manage the whole process. The
result of each simulation was a dual bound value and a corresponding computing
time for each decomposition. No time limit was given to the simulations, but a
very limited number of runs did not terminate after weeks of computing. Those
were marked as “timeout”; obtaining a valid dual bound was always possible, even
on timeout instances.

After preliminary experiments we decided to remap time values in a base 10
logarithm scale. Both time and bound were then transformed into scores in the
range [0, 1] through a feature scaling normalization, using as limits the maximum
and minimum values on the decompositions of the same base instance. That is, we
assigned higher scores to high bounds and low computing times: decompositions

6

that reached the time limit received score 0 in computing time whereas those that
had maximum (resp. minimum) values in bound (resp. time) received score 1.
After all decompositions related to a certain base instance were processed, each of
them was marked as positive or negative according to the following relaxed Pareto
optimality deﬁnition.

Let A and B be two decompositions for the same base instance, let bA and bB
be the dual bound scores they yield, and let tA and tB be the computing time
scores required to achieve them. We deﬁne decomposition A to be dominated by
decomposition B if and only if bA · (1 + β) ≤ bB and tA · (1 + τ ) ≤ tB, where β and
τ are two tolerance parameters that we use to control how many decompositions
can be considered comparably good.

In particular, for the time tolerance τ we evaluated 10 logarithmic spaced val-
ues from 1% to 100%, while for the bound we evaluated 10 linearly spaced values
from 0.1% to 10%. After ﬁxing β and τ , each decomposition that was dominated by
no other was marked as positive, all the remaining ones as negative. These boolean
marks were added to the dataset as class labels. Bounds and computing time were
recorded, but excluded from the set of features, as they are not statically observ-
able, and therefore unsuitable as input in a hypothetical decomposition generation
process.

In Figure 4 (resp. 5) we report the average number of positive decompositions
for every value of τ (resp. β) over every possible value of β (resp. τ ). Variations
on τ have a sharp eﬀect on the number of Pareto optimal decompositions whereas
variations on β have a more limited impact.

We performed experiments on several tolerance conﬁgurations, ﬁnding the fol-

lowing two to be more representative of the general behavior of our methods:

– Tolerance L (Low): with 13% tolerance τ on time and 0.77% tolerance β on

bound,

– Tolerance H (High): with 21% tolerance τ on time and 10.00% tolerance β on

bound.

For the analysis performed in the following sections we therefore report results
considering both settings.

3 A preliminary analysis of the dataset

As reported, the initial dataset was composed by 39 base instances, and 1000
decompositions for each of them. Three base instances were then excluded, as

their decompositions went systematically timeout. Duplicate records (about 4%)
were discarded as well. The relevant features of the dataset were normalized with
a simple criterion: measures on the number of variables of each decomposition
were divided by the number of variables of the corresponding base instance; the
same was done for the constraints. The dataset obtained after these operations
consisted of 34565 records and 117 features. About 2% and 14% of decompositions
were classiﬁed as positive respectively with tolerance L and tolerance H.

As far as the dimensionality of the dataset is concerned, we found through a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 22 components to be signiﬁcant according to
the eigenvalues criterion [20]. However, all these components had a correlation near
zero to both time and bound scores. Indeed, we performed many of the subsequent
experiments also by considering this set of 22 components instead of the full set
of original features. No quality increase was obtained, and at the same time we
encountered no particular computational bottleneck. Therefore we present only
results on the dataset using the full set of features.

Fig. 7 Corr. between feat. and time

Fig. 8 Corr. between feat. and bound

As a double check for the initial sampling process we compared the trade-
oﬀ between time and bound scores for decompositions of each base instance. In
Figure 6 we report a scatter plot of time (y axis) and bound (x axis) scores on
four representative base instances: each point represents the behavior of a single
decomposition. The sampling process produced diﬀerent categories of results. In
base instances like beasleyC3 the randomized sampling algorithm was very suc-
cessful in uniformly sampling our search space, ﬁnding also a few decompositions
proving to be simultaneously good in terms of bound and time. In others, like
timtab1 the sampling was still adequate, yielding as expected to a larger set of
positive decompositions covering diverse trade-oﬀs between bound and time. A
few instances like p2756 showed a biased outcome, including both good bound and
good time decompositions, but no decomposition providing reasonable trade-oﬀs.
Finally, in instances like enlight13, an interesting stack-like structure appeared,
suggesting the search for algorithms trying in these special cases to locally improve
decompositions after an initial random selection.

4 Correlation analysis

We initially focused on a fundamental question, that is understanding if single
features could be found that were predictive on the performance of decompositions.
To this aim, we measured the linear correlation between each feature and both
time and bound scores. In Figure 7 (resp. 8) we report the results of this analysis
for the time (resp. bound) score, depicting for each feature (x axis) its linear
correlation coeﬃcient value (y axis) over all the decompositions of the dataset.
Both analyses highlight that there is no single feature with strong correlation,
not even the number of blocks as one may expect. The only features that have a
non-negligible correlation (i.e., over 0.6) are the average and maximum number of
binary variables in blocks with respect to the bound score; such a result is trivially
related to the eﬀect of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition process.

We repeated the same analysis splitting the dataset base instance by base in-
stance, to understand if diﬀerent features could be predictive of scores on diﬀerent
base instances. We report our results in Figure 9 (resp. Figure 10) for time score
(resp. bound score) with a box plot for each feature, collecting the linear corre-
lation distribution summary (y axis) between each feature (x axis) over diﬀerent
base instances. Again, the results conﬁrm that no single feature shows high cor-

relation with scores on every base instance. At the same time, a set of instances
show to have strong correlation with a restricted set of features. This is depicted
in ﬁgures 11 for time score and 12 for bound score, in which we plot the third
quartile (y axis) of the distribution of correlations between features and scores on
each base instance (x axis).

The correlation analysis suggests that relationships between the features of
the dataset and time and bound scores exist. This conﬁrms that the set of fea-
tures in our dataset is meaningful, but also that an algorithmic approach trying to
optimize static features of decompositions might be pertinent. However, no sim-

ple link between features and scores emerges, and therefore the task of deﬁning
suitable quality measures, to be used in optimization algorithms for creating good
decompositions, is highly non trivial.

5 Splitting positive and negative decompositions

We therefore tackled a more involved question, that is if combinations of features
exist, that might be predictive on decompositions performance. We devised the
following approach. First, we deﬁned a distance measure between decompositions
in the space of time and bound scores, and we tried to check if ﬁnding a suitable
model was possible, mapping whole vectors of features to score distances. We
employed regression techniques for such a check. Then, we tackled the problem
of automatically detecting if a decomposition is positive (that is, Pareto optimal
according to the deﬁnition of Section 2) through classiﬁcation models.

5.1 Regression analysis

As sketched above, we ﬁrst deﬁned the following distance measure between de-
compositions in the space of time and bound scores:

∆(A, B) =(cid:112)(tA − tB)2 + α · (bA − bB)2

where α is a suitable weighting parameter. Then, following the intuition that
good decompositions are those having low score distance to positive ones, we
computed for each decomposition A, the following Pareto-distance value:

δ(A) = min

B∈P(A)

{∆(A, B)}

where P(A) is the set of positive decompositions on the base instance of A.

For each decomposition we calculated two Pareto-distance scores, both using
Tolerance L for deﬁning P(A): the ﬁrst one with α = 1, that is equally weighting

time and bound scores, and a second one with α = 10 in which bound diﬀerences
have higher importance. In ﬁgure 13 we report the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) of the δ(·) values for the case α = 1, showing decomposition distances to
√
be spread fairly evenly in the range [0.0,

2].

As a double check, for both α = 1 and α = 10 cases, we performed a cor-
relation analysis between δ(·) and each feature in the dataset. The results are
reported in Figure 14 for α = 1 and in Figure 15 for α = 10: linear correlation
values (y axis) are reported for each attribute (x axis). In the α = 10 case a set of
features have correlation values over 0.7. These are those features related to the
constraint right hand side values of both the blocks and the border: right hand
side values are negatively correlated to distance, while right hand side dispersions
are positively correlated to distance; the second phenomenon actually matches the
common practice of mathematical programming experts, that whenever appropri-
ate tend to keep homogeneous master and subproblems, while we conjecture the
ﬁrst one to depend on full base instances rather than on single decompositions.

Then, we tried to model δ(·) as a function of the decomposition features by
means of regression techniques. We trained a Support Vector Regression (SVR)
model [18] to predict the values of Pareto distance δ(·) given the vector of de-
composition features. We split the dataset, using 75% of data for training and the
remaining for testing. In particular, we chose representative training samples by
categorizing the full dataset in 10 layers, based on the distance values, and by
performing a stratiﬁed sampling, randomly picking 75% of data from each layer.

Fig. 16 Training, predicted values over
expected ones. α = 1

Fig. 17 Testing, predicted values over ex-
pected ones. α = 1

Fig. 18 Training, CDF of absolute error.
α = 1

Fig. 19 Testing, CDF of absolute error.
α = 1

We experimented by training four diﬀerent models using either α = 1 or α = 10,
and either using the full set of features or only those 8 being strongly correlated
with the δ(·) calculated with α = 10. The R statistical analysis framework [27]
3.2.5 was used for this experiment, and in particular the SVR implementation of
the e1071 library.

Only the model with α = 1 using the full set of features showed predictive
potential. For that setting we report in Figure 16 for the training set and in Figure
17 for the test set, a scatter plot detailing the predicted values (y axis) respect
to the calculated ones (x axis); that is, points on the bisector of the quadrant are
perfect predictions.

We also report the CDF of absolute prediction errors in ﬁgures 18 and 19
for the training and testing phases, resp.. Similarly, we report the CDF of mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) for both training (20) and testing (21). MAPE
was calculated by excluding decompositions whose δ(·) values were in the ﬁrst
tenth percentile, since they were too small to produce signiﬁcant results. About
80% of the absolute errors in both training and testing are below 0.2 conﬁrming
that most predictions fall in an area relatively close to the correct values. MAPE
ﬁgures show similar results and conﬁrm that high errors occur more often on low
distances.

5.2 Classiﬁcation analysis

Strictly speaking, to accurately predict the score distance δ() is unnecessary in
our application. In fact, all we need would be a model helping to discard any
decomposition which is not Pareto optimal. Therefore, having veriﬁed that com-
binations of features exist, that tend to be predictive on bound and time scores,
we tried a classiﬁcation experiment considering each decomposition to possess a
target feature taking value true for those decompositions being marked as positive
with respect to their base instance, false otherwise, and a set of numerical predic-
tors given by the decomposition features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) [17]
implementation of library e1071 of the R framework was used in this experiment.
We ﬁrst report that no experiment was successful using the original dataset as it
was, since the set of positive instances was always too small to impact on training.
Therefore, performed a splitting of the dataset in training and test data; training
data was then re-sampled by allowing repetitions, and balanced in diﬀerent ways.
Test data was left untouched. A 1:1 balancing between positives and negatives in
the training set allowed a SVM classiﬁer to reach good overall accuracy, but lacked
precision. A ﬁner look at the results revealed that sampling positive decompositions
multiple times from the training dataset did not guarantee enough support for most
base instances. For this reason, we further reﬁned the creation of a representative
training dataset by performing a stratiﬁed sampling of 75% of positive and negative
decompositions for every instance independently. Then a 1:1 balancing was obtained
for each of them through re-sampling; the samples were in the end merged in a
single set.

Our results on the test set are detailed in Table 1 for both tolerance L and
H. The table contains one row for each base instance, and is split in two blocks,
one for each tolerance setting. For each setting and each base instance we report
the number of True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN) and
True Positive (TP) elements in the test set. We also summarize the results in
Figure 23 for the tolerance L case; for reference, we also report the performance
on the training set (Figure 22). For each base instance (x axis) we report the
true positive rate (TPR), deﬁned as TP/(TP+FN) (red dots) and true negative
rate (TNR), deﬁned as TN / (TN + FP) (blue circles). Overall, we obtained 77%
accuracy in testing when using tolerance L to deﬁne positive decompositions. The
corresponding accuracy in training was 80%, suggesting mismatches to be more
due to the structure of data than due to a lack of generalization power or other

modeling problems. However, a closer look reveals a very heterogeneous behavior
among the base instances: while on a few we obtained unacceptable accuracy, on
the majority of them accurate classiﬁcation of both positives and negatives was
produced.

We therefore deﬁned the following success score measure, to clearly split base

instances that we are able to classify with good accuracy from the others:

success(x) =

(cid:26) 0,

if min(T P R, T N R) < 0.5;

T P R+T N R
2

, otherwise.

Our results in terms of success score on the test set of each base instance
are reported in Figure 24. We were able to classify with a good success score 26
base instances over 36. For the remaining 10: TNR was below 0.5 for gmu-35-40

mine-90-10, pigeon-10, reblock67, rmine6.

This could depend on many factors. First, features of the dataset may represent
well only a subset of the available base instances. Second, the positive decomposi-
tions of an unsuccessful base instance may not have common characteristics, i.e.,
more decompositions are needed to catch possible similarities between them. This
may depend on the structure of the base instance or on the capabilities of the
random sampling algorithm described in Section 2. Third, training the classiﬁer
using every available base instance may be detrimental to some if their structure is
totally diﬀerent from the most common one. Although further research is needed
to explain these factors, classiﬁcation shows potential and could be used with good
accuracy if enough data about a given base instance is present in the dataset.

6 Clustering

Our classiﬁcation analysis highlighted that the the single base instance struc-
ture has a fundamental impact on the prediction potential. It would be therefore
tempting to conclude that best results would be obtained by independently train-
ing a diﬀerent model for each base instance, as similarities between diﬀerent base
instances would be negligible. We therefore performed experiments on a similar
setting, surprisingly observing a worsening in the accuracy when diﬀerent models
were trained on each base instance independently.

In an eﬀort for understanding such a phenomenon, we tried to assess the inter
base instance relationships through cluster analysis. We performed it in two phases:
cluster proﬁling and cluster-based classiﬁcation.

6.1 Cluster proﬁling

In the ﬁrst phase, we used a standard k-means model to ﬁnd clusters of positive
decompositions only. We ﬁrst performed analyses by setting k = 36, that is allowing
as many clusters as base instances, and then consider also k = 5 and k = 50 as
representatives for aggressive and loose aggregation scenarii. The k-means heuris-
tics implementation of the e1071 R library was used [21], performing 1000 random
restarts, each involving 10000 iterations. Data was randomly shuﬄed before the
execution of the algorithm and experiments were repeated to test both tolerance
L and tolerance H.

Our results are presented in Table 2 for each tolerance setting (ﬁrst column)
and for each target values of clusters k. The table is composed by two blocks. In

the left one we present aggregated results by base instance, including the overall
percentage of base instances whose decompositions are assigned to more than one
cluster (Support), the average number of clusters to which such split base instances
are assigned (Average) and the number of clusters to which the most split base
instance is assigned (Max). In the right block we report similar details, but aggre-
gated by cluster: the overall percentage of clusters containing decompositions of
more than a single base instance (Support), the average number of base instances
having decompositions which are assigned to a heterogeneous cluster (Average) or
to the most heterogeneous one (Max). The case k = 5 is representative of a gen-
eral phenomenon: independently on the chosen tolerance, a single base instance
has decompositions assigned to diﬀerent clusters, and only two clusters contain
decompositions of more than a single instance, one of which collecting decompo-
sitions of 33 base instances; the average number of base instances for each cluster
is therefore high only because of that single high value.

The case k = 36 is a key test. In addition to the results in the table, in Figure 25
we report the details for the test with Tolerance H. In the left (resp. right) ﬁgure for
each base instance (resp. each cluster) we report the number of clusters containing
decompositions of that base instance (resp. the number of base instances having
decompositions in that cluster).

Remarkably, even when k is set equal to the number of base instances, the best
clustering option is not to always put decompositions of the same base instances in
the same cluster. More in details, decompositions of a same base instance are often
assigned to diﬀerent clusters (left ﬁgure): complete intra base instance similarity is
not always guaranteed. In these cases, only subsets of decompositions are similar.
Results also conﬁrm (right ﬁgure) that often clusters aggregate decompositions of
more than one base instance. This means that inter base instance similarity is non
negligible.

The same happens allowing for more clusters (k = 50), proving such a phe-
nomenon not to disappear even when intra base class splits are possible without
the need of balancing by mixing decompositions of diﬀerent base instances.

Clustering behaves similarly for tolerance L and tolerance H. With 5 clusters
most of the decompositions are aggregated into a single cluster. When the number
of clusters increases, aggregation is discouraged but is still present in about one
third of the clusters. When aggregation on base instances is analyzed, support and
max values grow linearly with the number of clusters; the average value is however
independent from it and is always close to 3.

6.2 Cluster-based classiﬁcation

Following the rationale that negative decompositions should be distant from the
positive ones, in the second part of the experiment we used the clusters found in
the previous step in a nearest-neighbor based classiﬁer.

That is, our classiﬁcation model is a collection I of hyperspheres in the decom-
positions feature space, representing regions where positive decompositions cluster.
Training consists in ﬁnding the centers ci and radii ti of these hyperspheres in the
decompositions feature space.

Then classiﬁcation of an arbitrary decomposition works as follows: if the de-
composition falls within any hypersphere i in I, that is if its distance in the feature

space with respect to the corresponding center ci is less than or equal to the corre-
sponding threshold ti, then the decomposition is classiﬁed as positive. Otherwise,
the decomposition is classiﬁed as negative.

In our experiments, training was performed by sampling 75% of the positive
decompositions of every base instance, building clusters and ﬁnding cluster cen-
ters with them, and ﬁnally computing thresholds. Two possible thresholds were
experimented, setting each ti to either the median distance from decompositions
in the training set assigned to cluster i, or the third quartile of the corresponding
distribution. Testing was then performed using the remaining 25% of positive de-
compositions, and all the negative ones. The Table 3 reports the TNR and TPR
for each tolerance setting, each value of k and each threshold selection policy.

The true negative rate mostly depends on the number k of clusters: 5 are
not enough to guarantee good accuracy as aggregating a high number of instances
means negative decompositions to fall more easily (and inappropriately) within the
thresholds. Allowing a higher number of clusters guarantees better performance.
In our tests, the classiﬁer worked best when using 36 clusters and thresholds equal
to the third quartile for each cluster. Changing the values of the thresholds has a
direct impact on the true positive and true negative rates. Positive samples and
negative ones are not completely disjunct and choosing the threshold values resorts
in a trade-oﬀ between TNR and TPR.

To further estimate the impact of intra-base instance relationships, we repeated
our experiments by keeping the training phase identical, but artiﬁcially forcing
during the test phase each decomposition to be either assigned to one of the
clusters containing training elements of its base instance, or classiﬁed as negative.
The corresponding TNR for each base instance is reported in ﬁgures 27-30 for
tolerance H with k equal to 5, 36, and 50 clusters. The TPR is instead implicitly
ﬁxed when choosing the threshold.

We ﬁrst observed that negative decompositions are seldom misclassiﬁed by clus-
ters to which no positive decomposition of the corresponding base instance was
assigned during training, that is they are far from their centers. Strictly speaking,
the TNR cannot decrease, as we are comparing each decomposition with a subset
of I, thereby decreasing the cases allowing it to be marked as positive. It could
increase, as decompositions previously falling into hyperspheres of alternative clus-
ters are instead classiﬁed as negative. However, we experimentally observed it to
increase only marginally (less than 1%), suggesting inter cluster dissimilarity to
be high, and therefore conﬁrming a inter base instance cluster tendency in our
dataset. That also suggests, in order to improve our understanding of positive and

negative decompositions, to focus more on improving intra-cluster classiﬁcation,
as diﬀerent clusters already encode well distinct structures.

Second, the TNR improvements obtained by using a lower threshold are diﬀer-
ent from instance to instance and better results could be obtained in every test by
calibrating the threshold diﬀerently for each cluster, eventually reaching even per-
fect classiﬁcation for some instances. In these cases, it may be possible to increase
the threshold to classify better positive samples without losing accuracy.

Third, some base instances that had TNR equal to 0 in one experiment have
higher accuracy in others in which the number of clusters and their structure is dif-
ferent. That conﬁrms that aggregation between diﬀerent base instances helps clas-
siﬁcation. A remarkable, yet counter-intuitive, example is instance 6 (enlight13),
that on the k = 50 test had TNR equal to 0, while by lowering k = 36 improves
its TNR to 1 (i.e., by forcing more aggregation we improve accuracy). Of course,
a deeper analysis would be needed to understand if such a property is structural,
or just a coincidence, or even an artifact of our random sampling algorithm.

Finally, aggregation allows to classify with good accuracy negative samples
that could not be classiﬁed at all with a SVM model. To support such a claim, we
highlight the case with tolerance H, k = 36, ti set to the median of distances: SVM
had ten base instances with either TNR or TPR below 0.5 (see Figure 24); the
nearest-neighbor classiﬁer, instead, has only two base instances with TNR below
0.5, and TPR always about 0.5 by deﬁnition (see Figure 28).

7 Perspectives

In this paper we faced the ambitious task of understanding which features make
a decomposition pattern for an arbitrary MIP appealing. We employed a machine
learning approach, creating a large, balanced and heterogeneous dataset of random
decompositions, explicitly solving the corresponding relaxations, computing suit-
able a-posteriori scores to be used as ground truth, and then trying to distinguish
automatically good decompositions from bad ones by considering a-priori features
of the MIP instances as predictors.

As expected, the task turned out to be rather complex: we found no model
that was able to generalize completely, providing reasonable accuracy on decom-
positions for a certain base instance, if such a base instance was never seen before.
Instead, machine learning models show potential when used to detect good de-
compositions for base instances that are similar to previously seen ones, which is
indeed the normal working condition of a general purpose solver, where the user
often optimizes several instances of very few, often similar, problems.

Furthermore, our experiments proved that there is no single feature, not even
those proposed in the literature, that shows enough predictive power when used
alone. At the same time, by combining diﬀerent features we obtained encouraging
results: in 72% of the base instances we considered, it was possible to automatically
detect if a decomposition was promising or not with good accuracy and precision.
It was even possible to observe, although only as a qualitative proof-of-concept,
that a-posteriori scores can be estimated as a function of a-priori features by means
of regression techniques. Understanding the reasons behind the misclassiﬁcation
in the remaining 28% of the base instances is still an open question and possibly

requires more representative features, more data and more experiments, with focus
more on base instance classiﬁcation than on decomposition classiﬁcation.

Another promising result is the assessment of cluster tendency among decom-
positions related to diﬀerent base instances. That is, our experiments highlighted
that good and bad decompositions clearly share similarities and dissimilarities
across base instances, thereby suggesting the search through automatic tools for
classes of good decomposition patterns which are independent on the particular
base instance.

Besides clarifying these aspects, the next research step would be to extract the
parameters of our predictive models, and use them in optimization algorithms for
ﬁnding good decompositions. We ﬁnally remark that, although we tried through all
our experiments to keep unbiased input (that is, promising and unpromising base
instances, good and bad decompositions), in our vision the generic decompositions
search methods found by machine learning are meant to be integrated with existing
alternative ones from the literature. A cascade approach might be appropriate,
such that whenever a new base instance is provided, the solver tries ﬁrst of all to
detect previously known structures, then to detect if the decomposition approach
might be pertinent or not, and only as a ﬁnal step to automatically generate a
good decomposition pattern.
