This dataset consists of three groups of hyperspectral images 
of apple tree plants. The ﬁrst group of images consists of a 
temporal monitoring of seven apple tree plants, infected with 
ﬁre blight ( Erwinia amylovora) , and six control plants over 
a period of 15 days. The second group of images includes 
a temporal monitoring of three infected plants, seven plants 
subjected to water stress, and seven control plants. The third 
group of images corresponds to acquisitions made in the or- 
chard on nine trees showing symptoms of ﬁre blight and six 
control trees. The pixel locations of infected areas have been 
provided for all images featuring symptomatic plants.

• The data presents a temporal monitoring of apple tree plants, infected or not with ﬁre 
blight, in a sequence of hyperspectral images. Therefore, it enables other researchers to 
study the potential of hyperspectral imaging for early disease detection [1 , 2] . 

• This dataset is intended for researchers and developers of digital solutions for agriculture 
to test new methods (variable selection, data exploration, regression methods) or to have 
reference data to guide their future experiments. 

• This dataset can be used to build disease classiﬁcation models, distinguishing between 
symptomatic and non-symptomatic classes, as well as the class subjected to water stress. 

2. Data Description 

The data is organized into three groups: 

• Data acquired in March 2021: the images were acquired under laboratory conditions with 

7 plants inoculated with ﬁre blight on leaves and 6 control plants. 

• Data acquired in July 2021: the images were acquired under laboratory conditions with 
3 plants inoculated with ﬁre blight on leaves, 7 plants subjected to water stress, and 7 
control plants. 

• Data acquired in May 2022: the images were acquired in the orchard and contain 9 plants 

showing symptoms of ﬁre blight and 6 control plants without symptoms. 

The data is organized into folders that include the month and year of acquisition. For the 
images acquired under laboratory conditions, each folder contains subfolders named according 
to the day of acquisition relative to the ﬁrst day of inoculation. Inside each subfolder, there are 
folders labelled with the plant number, each containing four ﬁles (see Fig. 1 ): 

- An  “.HDR” header  ﬁle  containing  metadata  describing  the  image  format  and  enabling 

proper data reading. 

- A “.DAT” ﬁle containing the binary data of the hyperspectral image. 
- A “.PNG” ﬁle providing an RGB view of the acquired image. 
- A “.CSV” ﬁle containing the positions of symptomatic pixels for the inoculated plants. This 
ﬁle has two columns: the ﬁrst indicates the vertical position of the pixel, while the second 
indicates the horizontal position of the pixel.

For the images acquired in the orchard, inside the corresponding folder, there are subfolders 
labelled with the plant number, also containing the same four ﬁles: a “.HDR” ﬁle, a “.DAT” ﬁle, 
a “.PNG” ﬁle, and a “.CSV” ﬁle with the positions of symptomatic pixels. 

2.1. Data Acquired in March 2021 

The laboratory data from March 2021 consists of a temporal series of hyperspectral images 
of apple tree plants inoculated on the leaves, as well as control plants. These images are divided 
into 3 subsets: 

• The ﬁrst subset includes images of inoculated plants 1, 2, 3, 4, as well as images of control 
plants 8 and 9. These images were acquired from day 4 to day 15 after inoculation, with 
missing images from day 9 to day 11. The ﬁrst signs of ﬁre blight are visible to the naked 
eye as early as the 5th day on these plants. 

• The second subset contains images of inoculated plants 5, 6, and 7, as well as images of 
control plants 10 and 11. The images were acquired from day 1 to day 15 after inoculation, 
with the ﬁrst visible signs to the naked eye appearing on the 7th day for these plants. 

• The third subset includes images of control plants 12 and 13. The images were acquired from 

day 1 to day 15 after inoculation, with missing images for days 3, 12, and 13. 

The positions of the ﬁre blight spots were extracted for each infected leaf of the inoculated 
plants, from the appearance of the symptoms. The Table 1 summarizes the acquisitions of the 
different plants based on the number of days after inoculation. 

It should be noted that, although some plants showed symptoms, it was diﬃcult to locate 
the symptomatic pixels on the inoculated leaves. Consequently, the position of these pixels is 
not provided. 

Table 2 summarizes the acquisitions of the different plants based on the number of days after 

inoculation.

Fig. 2 illustrates the temporal evolution of the average spectra for plant 6, which was inocu- 
lated on the leaf, and plant 11, which was not inoculated. The spectra were recorded on different 
acquisition dates. It is noticeable that the shape of the average spectra for the inoculated plant 
varies considerably with the acquisition date, in contrast to the relatively stable average spectra 
of the non-inoculated plant. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced in the region encom-

and 15 days after inoculation. 

passing the diminished chlorophyll peak and the plateau between 750 nm and 900 nm, where 
a distinct transition from a plateau to a slope can be observed. 

2.2. Data Acquired in July 2022 

The  laboratory  data  from  July  2022  presents  a  temporal  monitoring  over  a  period  of  23 
days for apple tree plants inoculated on leaves, plants subjected to water stress, and control 
plants. The images were acquired from day 2 to day 23 after inoculation, encompassing 3 leaf- 
inoculated plants, 6 control plants, and 8 plants subjected to water stress. The acquisitions were 
done on weekdays, which explains the absence of images for weekends. Fire blight symptoms 
are visible to the naked eye as early as the 7th day following inoculation, and the positions of 
spots were extracted for each infected leaf of the 3 inoculated plants, starting from the appear- 
ance of symptoms. 

It should be noted that the inoculated leaf 2.1 of plant 2 was monitored for 23 days, while 
4 other symptomatic leaves of the same plant (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5) were monitored from day 20 
to day 23 after inoculation. The table below summarizes the observations made based on the 
number of days after inoculation. 

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the inoculated leaf of plant 3 fell on the 14 th day, 

which explains the absence of acquisitions from that date. 

For example, Fig. 3 (a), (b), and (c) respectively show the evolution of the average spectra 
for leaf-inoculated plant 2, non-inoculated plant 4, and plant 11 under water stress, based on 
the acquisition date. It is possible to observe that the shape of the average spectra for plant 2 
and plant 11 varies differently depending on the acquisition date, mainly in the spectral ranges 
between 500 and 680 nm, as well as between 700 and 900 nm. On the other hand, the shape 
of the average spectrum for non-inoculated plant 4 remains stable regardless of the acquisition 
date. Fig. 4 shows the acquisition conditions in the laboratory.

2.3. Data Acquired in the Orchard 

The data acquired in the orchard in May 2022 involves apple tree plants exhibiting symptoms 
of bacterial ﬁre blight on leaves, as well as non-symptomatic plants. The images were acquired 
over the course of a single day from 9 am to 4 pm, encompassing 9 plants with symptomatic 
leaves and 6 non-symptomatic plants. The positions of symptomatic pixels were extracted for 
each infected leaf of the 8 symptomatic plants. 

3. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 

3.1. March 2021 Acquisitions 

In order to monitor the progression of ﬁre blight symptoms, artiﬁcial inoculations were con- 
ducted on bench-grafted apple plants in a level 2 conﬁned greenhouse module at CTIFL in Lanx-

ade, Prigonrieux, France. Three trials were conducted on 13 bench-grafted apple plants of the 
"Chantecler" variety. The Erwinia amylovora strain CFBP3472 was inoculated at a concentration 
of 2 × 10 ^ 12 cfu/ml by incising the leaves with a knife [3] . The three biological trials were con- 
ducted successively with a one-week interval. The ﬁrst trial consisted of 6 plants, including 4 
plants inoculated on leaves and 2 non-inoculated plants as controls. The second biological trial 
consisted of 5 plants, including 3 plants inoculated on leaves and 2 non-inoculated plants as 
controls. The third trial consisted of 2 non-inoculated plants as controls. 

3.2. July 2022 Acquisitions 

In  order  to  monitor  the  progression  of  ﬁre  blight  symptoms,  artiﬁcial  inoculations  were 
conducted  on  potted  grafts  in  a  level  2  conﬁned  greenhouse  module  at  CTIFL  in  Lanxade, 
Prigonrieux, France. Three trials were performed on 17 potted Gala apple tree plants. The strain 
CFBP3472 of Erwinia amylovora was inoculated at a concentration of 106 cfu/ml by making inci- 
sions on the leaves using a knife. This trial consisted of 17 plants, including 3 plants inoculated 
on the leaves, 6 non-inoculated plants as controls, and 8 plants subjected to water stress. 

3.3. Orchard Acquisition in May 2022 

The image acquisitions were carried out in Plan d’Organ, France, in an orchard of "Rosy Glow" 
apple trees. The acquisitions were done in a single day on the leaves of 9 plants showing symp- 
toms of ﬁre blight and 6 symptom-free plants. 

3.4. Image Acquisition Method 

The  different  image  acquisition  campaigns  were  conducted  using  a  SPECIM  IQ  camera 
(Specim spectral imaging LTD. ©) ( Fig. 5 ), which offers a resolution of 512 ∗512 pixels and 204 
wavelengths covering a spectral range from 397 nm to 966 nm. A reference (SRS50, Spectralon®) 
was placed near the scene to correct for variations in brightness during image processing. For

the March 2021 campaign, the acquisition distance was 50 cm, and a black curtain was placed 
behind the plant to avoid potential interactions with the background. Two halogen lamps (Ref 
ampoule: Single Ended Halogen - HPL HPL 575W 240V 88477) were positioned one meter away 
from the plant at an incident angle of 45 ° to provide uniform illumination of the scene. The 
same conditions were used for the July 2022 campaign, except for the camera-to-plant distance, 
which was 25 cm, and the replacement of the black curtain with a black panel. For the May 
2022 acquisitions in the orchard, the same conditions as the laboratory acquisitions in July 2022 
were employed, except for the lighting, which was natural. All images were automatically cor- 
rected for reﬂectance by the camera. 

3.5. Limitations 

None.
