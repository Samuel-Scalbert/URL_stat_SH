Increasing the cultivated diversity has been identiﬁed as a major leverage for the
agroecological transition as it can help improve the resilience of low input cropping
systems. For wheat, which is the most cultivated crop worldwide in terms of harvested
area, the use of cultivar mixtures is spreading in several countries, but studies have
seldom focused on establishing mixing rules based on plant architecture. Yet, the aerial
architecture of plants and the overall canopy structure are critical for ﬁeld performance as
they greatly inﬂuence light interception, plant interactions and yield. The very high number
of trait combinations in wheat mixtures makes it difﬁcult to conduct experimentations on
this issue, which is why a modeling approach appears to be an appropriate solution. In
this study, we used WALTer, a functional structural plant model (FSPM), to simulate wheat
cultivar mixtures and try to better understand how differences between cultivars in key
traits of the aerial architecture inﬂuence mixture performance. We simulated balanced
binary mixtures of cultivars differing for different critical plant traits: ﬁnal height, leaf
dimensions, leaf insertion angle and tillering capability. Our study highlights the impact
of the leaf dimensions and the tillering capability on the performance of the simulated
mixtures, which suggests that traits impacting the plants’ leaf area index (LAI) have more
inﬂuence on the performance of the stand than traits impacting the arrangement of the
leaves. Our results show that the performance of mixtures is very variable depending on
the values of the explored architectural traits. In particular, the best performances were
achieved by mixing cultivars with different leaf dimensions and different tillering capability,
which is in agreement with numerous studies linking the diversity of functional traits in
plant communities to their productivity. However, some of the worst performances were
also achieved by mixing varieties differing in their aerial architecture, which suggests that

INTRODUCTION

Increasing the cultivated diversity has been identiﬁed as a major
leverage for the agroecological transition as it can help improve
the resilience of low input cropping systems (Malézieux, 2012;
Isbell, 2015). At the scale of the plot, diversity can be increased
by mixing species or by increasing the genetic diversity within a
species (varietal mixture for example). For wheat, which is the
most cultivated crop worldwide in terms of harvested area (Food
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2018), the use
of cultivar mixtures has been reported to present advantages for
yield and quality as well as for diseases resistance, insect pests
control, weed suppression, lodging limitation, exploitation of
water and soil nutrients and yield stability (Borg et al., 2018).
Moreover, the use of wheat cultivar mixtures is spreading in
several countries (Faraji, 2011). In France, for example, wheat
blends represented <1% of the total wheat surface in 2010 but
they represented more than 11% of the total wheat surface in
2019 (FranceAgriMer, 2019). To support the spread of cultivar
mixtures, assembly rules have been developed, but they’re almost
exclusively focused on diseases resistance (Borg et al., 2018).
Studies have seldom focused on establishing mixing rules based
on the plants architecture and the few existing recommendations
usually advocate the association of homogeneous cultivars, but
the demonstration of these guidelines seems to be lacking (Borg
et al., 2018).

Yet, plant architecture and the overall canopy structure are
critical for ﬁeld performance, as they strongly inﬂuence light
interception (Niinemets, 2010). Thus, many traits of the aerial
architecture, such as height, leaf dimensions, leaf inclination
and branching (i.e., tillering in cereals), have been identiﬁed for
their impact on light interception. Indeed, leaf dimensions have
a direct inﬂuence on the leaf area index (LAI) of the canopy,
which is the most basic property aﬀecting its light interception
(Pugnaire and Valladares, 2007). Branching is also an important
feature as it greatly impacts the total leaf area of the plant by
changing its number of leaves (Valladares and Niinemets, 2008).
On the other hand, plant height has a direct impact on the
leaf area distribution in the canopy and on the overlap between
neighboring leaves, which is critical for competition for light,
especially in heterogeneous canopies (Givnish, 1982). As for leaf
inclination, it determines the penetration of light into the canopy:
the more upright the leaves are, the deeper light can penetrate
into the lower layers of the canopy (Long et al., 2006). The
impact of all of these traits has been considered for the deﬁnition
of wheat ideotypes (i.e., ideal hypothetical plants for a given
context) (Donald, 1968) and in breeding programs (Reynolds
et al., 2012), but mostly in the context of single plants or pure
stands. However, the impact of these architectural traits would

also be of interest for the establishment of assembly rules and the
deﬁnition of mixture ideotypes (Litrico and Violle, 2015). To this
end, it is necessary to better understand the interactions taking
place in mixtures and the role played by architectural features in
these interactions.

The very high number of

trait combinations in wheat
mixtures makes it diﬃcult to conduct experimentations on
this issue, which is why a modeling approach appears to
be an appropriate solution. In particular, functional structural
plant models (FSPM, Godin and Sinoquet, 2005; Vos et al.,
2010) have the advantage of being individual-based, allowing
for the explicit consideration of inter-individual variations in
the stand (Zhang and De Angelis, 2020). Most importantly,
FSPM explicitly represent the 3D architecture of plants and
its interactions with the ecophysiological processes controlling
plant development. These models are thus particularly adapted
to study the impact of architectural traits on the performance of
heterogeneous canopies (Evers et al., 2019; Gaudio et al., 2019).
If past studies using FSPM were mainly focusing on sole crops
(Sarlikioti et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Da Silva et al., 2014;
Streit et al., 2016; Perez et al., 2018), more and more work is
now addressing mixtures of diﬀerent species or cultivars (Barillot
et al., 2014; Munz et al., 2018; Louarn et al., 2020). For wheat
cultivar mixtures, Barillot et al. (2019) have studied the impact
of diﬀerences in leaf inclination during the post-anthesis period;
and Vidal et al. (2018) have explored how diversity in plant height
could help control rain-borne diseases. However, no FSPM study
has yet focused on the impact of more than one trait on the
performance of wheat cultivar mixtures.

In this study, we used an FSPM to simulate balanced binary
wheat cultivar mixtures diﬀering in four traits of their aerial
architecture. Using a sensitivity analysis approach, we were able
to identify the major traits impacting the performance of the
simulated stands. This study improves our understanding of
how diﬀerences between cultivars in key traits of the aerial
architecture inﬂuence mixture performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

All the statistical analyses were done using the R software (R Core
Team, 2018).

WALTer: A 3D Wheat Model
WALTer (Lecarpentier et al., 2019) is an FSPM that simulates
the development of the aerial architecture of winter wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.) from sowing to maturity with a daily
time step. In the model, the vegetative development of the plants
(initiation, emergence, elongation and senescence of organs)
follows a thermal time schedule and is based on a formalism

Modeling Wheat Varietal Mixtures

derived from ADEL-Wheat (Fournier et al., 2003). The geometry,
size, developmental kinetics and the senescence of leaves and
internodes are simulated thanks to deterministic equations.
However, WALTer is not a completely deterministic model, as
the position of the plants, the orientation of the organs, the
duration before plant emergence and the emergence of tillers are
partly random.

Most importantly, WALTer simulates the competition for
light between plants within the ﬁeld and the resulting plasticity
of tillering (i.e., the branching ability of grasses), thanks to a
radiative model (CARIBU: Chelle et al., 1998). The regulation
of tillering in the model is based on three simple rules. (i)
Empirically ﬁxed probabilities control the emergence of new
tillers. Then, (ii) the cessation of tillering is controlled by an
early neighbor perception: plants stop emitting new tillers when
the surrounding Green Area Index1 (GAI) reaches a critical
value (GAIc). Finally, (iii) some of the tillers that were emitted
regress: a tiller regresses if the amount of photosynthetically
active radiation (PAR) it intercepts per unit area falls below a
threshold (PARt).

Based on this formalism, WALTer produces meaningful
outputs, such as the tillering dynamics of each plant (i.e., the
number of axes on a plant for each day of the simulation) and
the dynamics of light interception for each organ in the stand.

Since its publication in 2019 (Lecarpentier et al.), WALTer has
undergone some changes aiming at improving the performances
of the simulations, enhancing its realism and improving its
ability to simulate mixtures of varieties, reusing several models
distributed in the OpenAlea platform (Pradal et al., 2008, 2015).
Thus, in the new version of WALTer, the representation of
the leaves is based on the model by Fournier and Pradal
(2012). The shape of the blades is based on the equations
described in Dornbusch et al. (2009) and it is now possible
to represent curved leaves based on the formalism described
by Perez et al. (2016). The formalism for the dimensions of
the leaves remains unchanged. In addition, the discretization
of the sky was optimized by the use of a TURTLE sky (den
Dulk, 1989) as implemented in the Python package Alinea.astk
[package python]. (version 2.1.0, 2019). Furthermore, the option
to consider an inﬁnite periodic canopy, which is integrated in
the radiative model (Chelle et al., 1998), was implemented in
WALTer. Thus, it is no longer necessary to simulate additional
plants to discard border eﬀects. The computational cost of the
simulations was further reduced by removing all dispensable
(i.e., non-visible) organs from the 3D representation of plants.
Moreover, a project manager, that serializes parameters, inputs,
and outputs for each simulation, has been designed to distribute
the computation on high-performance computing infrastructure.
Modiﬁcations were also implemented to WALTer to allow the
simulation of complex, heterogeneous canopies, such as varietal
mixtures and populations, in which plants can diﬀer from each
other in many parameters. Finally, a ﬁtness module has been
implemented to allow the computation of the total ﬁtness of
the plot (Ftot) for each simulation. This new output is used as
a proxy of the number of kernels produced by the plot and is

computed by WALTer as the sum of the ﬁtness of all the axes
in the plot. The computation of the ﬁtness of an axis is based on
the following equation:

Faxis =

PARi45
Tm45

where Faxis is the ﬁtness of the axis (expressed in molPAR·◦Cd−1);
PARi45 is the mean daily amount of PAR intercepted by the axis
during the 45 days preceding ﬂowering (in molPAR·d−1); and
Tm45 is the mean temperature during the same period (in ◦C).

This equation is an adaptation of the photothermal quotient
(Nix, 1976), which has been demonstrated to be linearly
correlated to the number of grains produced in wheat (Midmore
et al., 1984; Fischer, 1985; Abbate et al., 1995; Demotes-Mainard
and Jeuﬀroy, 2001).

WALTer is available as an open source Python package on the

OpenAlea platform (https://github.com/openalea/walter).

Sensitivity Analysis
The impact of diﬀerent architectural traits on the performance
of wheat mixtures was evaluated through the simulation of
balanced binary mixtures (mixtures of two varieties with 50%
of each cultivar). To evaluate and hierarchize the inﬂuence
of the diﬀerent traits on the performance of the simulated
mixtures, a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the variance-
based Sobol method (Sobol, 1993). Because of the relatively
to run WALTer, a metamodeling
high computational cost
approach was chosen to enable the computation of Sobol indices.
The metamodel consists in a fast approximation of WALTer
constructed from a limited number of model runs. We used a
Gaussian process metamodel (Sacks et al., 1989; Currin et al.,
1991), also known as Kriging metamodel, as in Marrel et al.
(2009).

Three key outputs of the model were selected for the analyses
to reﬂect the performance of each simulated plot. First, the
mean number of ears per plant at maturity (Nears), which is
a key component of the plot’s yield, was selected. Second, the
proportion of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
intercepted by the stand (Lperc), was also taken into account. For
each stand, the daily Lperc was averaged over the whole period of
use of the radiative model (from around 100 days after sowing to
the maturity of the stand). Third, the total ﬁtness of the plot (Ftot)
was used for the analyses.

To allow the comparison of the performance of a mixture
with the performance of its pure components, the overyielding
was also computed for each of these three outputs, using the
following equation:

OYout =

outmix
outpure1+outpure2
2

where OYout is the overyielding for the considered output (Nears,
Lperc or Ftot); outmix is the value of the considered output for
the mixture; and outpure1 and outpure2 are the values of the
considered output for each of the two components of the mixture,
when cultivated in pure stands.

max, the greater the blade area. See

aLB
Supplementary Material for details.

Five parameters associated with four key traits were
considered (Table 1). For each of the ﬁve parameters, the impact
of the diﬀerential between the two varieties in the mixture was
considered (diﬀ), as well as the impact of the mean value in the
plot (ref). As a result, there were two input factors considered for
each parameter, for a total of 10 input factors for the sensitivity
analysis. The ranges of variation for all the input factors were
selected to generate biologically realistic varieties with contrasted
architectures. For example, the selected ranges allowed for the
simulation of varieties with a ﬁnal height between 40 and 160 cm
(Table 1).

To build the Kriging metamodel, we used a set of WALTer
runs following a 10 dimensions maximin latin hypercube
sampling (LHS; McKay et al., 1979; Johnson et al., 1990) of 5,000
simulations generated with the DiceDesign R package (Dupuy
et al., 2015) with the ranges detailed in Table 1. For each output
(Nears, Lperc and Ftot), a Kriging approximation was generated
using the DiceKriging R package (Roustant et al., 2012). The
sensitivity R package (Iooss et al., 2017) was then used to estimate
the Sobol indices. To be able to compute the overyielding for
every mixture, another set of WALTer runs was generated from
a ﬁve dimensions maximin LHS of 1,000 simulations. This
second LHS only includes simulations of pure stands (no trait
diﬀerential in the stand) and the ranges explored for each input
parameter corresponded to the minimum and maximum values
detailed in Table 1. Based on this second set of simulations,
a Kriging model was constructed independently for each of
the three outputs (Nears, Lperc and Ftot). Thus, the ﬁrst design
allowed the approximation of the behavior of mixtures while the
second design allowed the approximation of the behavior of the
corresponding pure components. Using the Kriging metamodels
from both designs, it was possible to compute sensitivity indices
for the overyielding of each output.

The simulated plots were composed of 110 plants sown at a
density of 200 plants/m². An intermediate sowing density was
chosen to allow for competition between plants while allowing
plants to potentially emit and maintain several tillers. The
number of plants to simulate was the object of preliminary
work taking into account the impact of the stochasticity of
WALTer on the model outputs (data not shown). The plants

were arranged in a grid pattern with plants equidistant from
each other and the diﬀerent cultivars were distributed randomly
in the plot (Figure 1). Apart from the input factors of the
sensitivity analysis described above and in Table 1, all genotypic
parameters were identical for both varieties in the mixture and
had values given in Lecarpentier et al. (2019) for the cultivar
Maxwell. The climatic sequence used for the simulations was
obtained by averaging the climatic sequences of ﬁve French
locations over 10 years (from 2007 to 2017). The ﬁve locations,
listed in Supplementary Material, were selected to represent
contrasted climatic conditions. For the computation of light
interception, only diﬀuse radiations were considered, according
to the standard overcast sky (Moon and Spencer, 1942). Diﬀuse
radiation was approximated using a set of 16 light sources
according to a TURTLE sky (den Dulk, 1989).

Optimization
From the Kriging metamodels,
is possible to seek for
combinations of architectural traits maximizing the performance
of the stand. However, the uncertainty of the metamodels can
aﬀect the results. Therefore, we decided to enrich the initial LHS
design with new runs of WALTer, based on an Eﬃcient Global
Optimization (EGO) algorithm (Jones et al., 1998). We decided
to focus on the maximization of Ftot, as this output encompasses
information about both Nears and Lperc. The initial LHS design
of 5,000 simulations was iteratively enriched with a new run
of WALTer until 50 new runs were added. At each iteration,
the parameters’ values for the new run were selected based on
the Expected Improvement (EI) criterion among a set of 10,000
parameter combinations sampled from a 10 dimensions latin
hypercube. The EI criterion was computed with the DiceOptim R
package (Roustant et al., 2012). The EI criterion is balancing the
need to maximize Ftot with the need to reduce the uncertainty of
the Kriging metamodel.

RESULTS

Outputs from the 5,000 initial simulations are highly variable
(Supplementary Material), which indicates that at least some of
the parameters varying in the LHS design have a strong impact on

Modeling Wheat Varietal Mixtures

FIGURE 1 | 3D representation of a plot simulated with WALTer, at three different stages of development (from left to right: 100, 200 and 300 days after sowing). The
simulated plot is a binary mixture composed of 110 plants sown at a density of 200 plants/m². The simulation considers the plot as the pattern of an inﬁnite periodic
canopy, removing border effects. Non-senescent organs are represented in green, except for ears that are represented in brown. Regressing tillers are represented in
blue and dead organs are represented in yellow.

the performance of the simulated stands. However, some outputs
are much more variable than others. Thus Nears is the most
variable output with values ranging from 1.0 to 4.3 ears per plant,
even though 98% of the simulations resulted in Nears values below
3.2 ears per plant. On the other hand, Lperc is much less variable,
with values ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. As for Ftot, the initial
simulations gave results ranging from 0.73 to 1.5 mol·◦Cd−1. For
the OY indicators, simulations gave values between 0.40 and 1.6
for Nears, and values between 0.67 and 1.9 for Ftot. Finally, the OY
for Lperc was less variable, with values ranging from 0.97 to 1.4.

Sensitivity Analysis
The ﬁrst-order sensitivity indices (MSI) provide information on
the mean inﬂuence of the diﬀerent inputs on each output and the
total-order indices (TSI) aggregate mean inﬂuence and inﬂuence
through interactions. The most important architectural traits
regarding the performance of the stands are dependent on the
considered output (Figure 2).

The mean number of ears per plant (Nears) is mainly
inﬂuenced by ﬁrst-order eﬀects. For this output the dimensions
of the leaves is the most inﬂuential trait in the simulated plots as it
explains more than 68% of the total variance of Nears (taking into
account the eﬀect of the interactions). The mean value of LB
in the stand has more impact on Nears than the diﬀerence of LB
max
between varieties (TSI = 0.41 and 0.28, respectively). The tillering
capability of the plants in the stand also has an important impact
on Nears: GAIc-diﬀ explains around 13% of the total variance of
the output and PARt-ref accounts for about 12%.

max

For Lperc, as for Nears, the input factor with the most inﬂuence
is LB
max-ref. Indeed, the variations of LB
max-ref explain almost
63% of the total variance of Lperc. GAIc is also an important
parameter for light interception with GAIc-ref accounting for
about 18% of the total variance of Lperc and GAIc-diﬀ explaining
more than 10% of its total variance. However, the impact of GAIc
on Lperc is mainly explained by interaction eﬀects. Finally, the
mean leaf insertion angle in the canopy has an important impact
on Lperc with a total-order sensitivity index of 0.15 for φB-ref.

All the other input factors have very little inﬂuence on the light
interception eﬃciency.

The input factor with the most impact on Ftot is LB

max-diﬀ (TSI
= 0.62). The mean value of PARt in the mixture (PARt-ref) and
the height diﬀerential between varieties (HMS-diﬀ) also have a
lot of inﬂuence on Ftot, as they explain 12 and 10% of the total
variance of this output respectively.

For the OY outputs, the two most inﬂuential input factors
are always LB
max-diﬀ and GAIc-diﬀ, regardless of the output
considered. Together, these two inputs always explain more than
77% of each OY output. Interestingly, interactions between input
factors have an important impact on these outputs, particularly
for the OY of Nears and Lperc. Nevertheless, diﬀerences exist
between the diﬀerent OY outputs. For example, for the OY of
Nears, GAIc-diﬀ has more impact than LB
max-diﬀ, whereas it is
LB
max-diﬀ that has the most inﬂuence on the OY of Lperc and Ftot.
To a lesser extent, other input factors also have a substantial
inﬂuence on the OY outputs. PARt-diﬀ, GAIc-ref and HMS-diﬀ
each explain more than 10% of the total variance of the OY of
Nears. The TSI of PARt-diﬀ for the OY of Nears even reaches 0.21,
but this eﬀect is mainly explained by interactions as its MSI is
only around 0.067. For the OY of Lperc, GAIc-ref, φB-diﬀ and
max-ref are important factors, each with a TSI >0.1. Finally,
LB
PARt-diﬀ explains almost 16% of the total variance of the OY
of Ftot.

Optimization
The sensitivity indices (Figure 2) only provide information about
the relative importance of the diﬀerent input parameters for
the determination of the performance of the stand. Heatmaps
representing the outputs of the Kriging metamodels as a function
of their most inﬂuential parameters (Figures 3–5) give more
information on how each parameter aﬀects each output. For these
ﬁgures however, it is important to keep in mind that the less
inﬂuential parameters were set to the mean value of their range of
variation, thus discarding most of the interaction eﬀect that they
might have with the other inputs. Another critical point when

reading these heatmaps is the fact that, when the input variable
is a parameter diﬀerence, it generates a plot that is symmetric
on the axis diﬀ = 0. And if the heatmap is a function of two
parameters-diﬀ, there is a central symmetry of the plot.

Figure 3 shows that the mean value of LB
max in the stand
(LB
max-ref) is negatively correlated to Nears, meaning that canopies
with small blades tend to produce more spikes than stands with
larger leaves. This heatmap also reveals that a diﬀerential of LB
max
between the cultivars of a mixture is unfavorable for the ear yield
in the simulated plots. Unlike Nears, Lperc is positively correlated
to LB
max-ref: larger leaves allow for a higher light interception
eﬃciency. Lperc is also positively correlated to GAIc-ref, but
mainly for values of GAIc-ref lower than 0.5: above this value,
the impact of GAIc-ref on Lperc is very low. This means that
Lperc is higher for stands in which plants have a low sensitivity
to the early competition (high GAIc values) and can thus emit
many tillers.

As for Ftot (Figure 4), unlike the results observed for Nears
(Figure 3), a diﬀerential of LB
max between the cultivars of a
mixture is favorable for the performance of the stand. An absolute
diﬀerential of around 10 cm between the two varieties in the
mixture leads to the highest values of Ftot. Moreover, the highest
values of Ftot can only be reached with low values of PARt-ref.

Indeed, there is a clear negative correlation between PARt-ref
and Ftot, which means that stands tend to be more productive
when plants in the canopy do not need much light to prevent the
regression of their tillers. Finally, even though the impact of HMS-
diﬀ on Ftot is low for the combinations of parameters presented in
Figure 4, the results show that homogeneous plant height in the
canopies lead to higher values of Ftot than the mixture of cultivars
with a height diﬀerential. Interestingly, for mixtures of varieties
with a height diﬀerential, Ftot is higher if the tallest variety is the
one with the smallest leaves.
For the OY outputs, LB

max-diﬀ and GAIc-diﬀ are always the
most inﬂuential inputs (Figure 2). However, the eﬀect of these
two inputs, when the other inputs are ﬁxed to their mean values,
are very diﬀerent depending on the output considered (Nears,
Lperc or Ftot) (Figure 5). Firstly, the combinations of parameters
presented in Figure 5 lead almost exclusively to OY values ≥1
for Ftot. This means that, for these combinations of parameters,
mixtures are almost always at least as performant as the mean of
their pure components. Conversely, OY values for Nears may be
as low as 0.6 and are rarely >1. Finally, for Lperc, the OY is mostly
around 1, with very little variation in its value. For this output,
the highest values of OY are obtained for the extreme values of

high values of GAIc with plants with small leaves and low GAIc
values. For Nears, the highest values of OY are also obtained for
the extreme values of GAIc-diﬀ, but for values of LB
max-diﬀ close
to 0. For mixtures with a diﬀerential in both LB
max and GAIc, the
OY of Nears is more important when the cultivar with the largest
leaves is also the one with the highest value of GAIc, as is the case
for the OY of Lperc. In contrast, the OY of Ftot is the highest when
mixing plants with large leaves and low GAIc values with plants
with small leaves and high GAIc values. Interestingly, despite
the observed diﬀerences between the combinations of parameters
leading to the highest OY for Nears and Ftot, Nears is positively
correlated to Ftot in the overall dataset (data not shown). Finally,
it is worth mentioning that the metamodels predict an OY of 1 for
mixtures with no trait diﬀerential between cultivars (Figure 5),
which means that they perform exactly like the corresponding
pure stands. This is expected as all the plants in such canopies
have identical parameter values. Thus, this result highlights the
consistency of the metamodels’ predictions.

In the initial design, diﬀerent combinations of parameters
can describe identical mixtures (as seen in the heatmaps). For
example, considering only φB-diﬀ and HMS-diﬀ, a stand with
the minimum values of these two parameters is identical to a
stand with the maximum values of the two parameters. Indeed
both combinations of parameters describe a mixture of tall
planophile plants with short erectophile plants. To avoid this
redundancy and simplify the analysis of the results, Figures 6, 7,
9 have been represented only with positive values of LB
max-diﬀ (all
combinations are considered, but the ones with negative values
of LB

max-diﬀ have been reversed).
Focusing on the 50 runs of the initial design with the highest
Ftot values (Figures 6, 7), it is possible to identify the trait
combinations leading to the best performances. Simulations
with high Ftot values usually combine high LB
max-diﬀ values
with low (negative) values of PARt-diﬀ. This combination of
parameters describes mixtures in which the genotype with the
largest leaves is the one with the lowest value of PARt, i.e., the one

less susceptible to tiller regression. However, there is a negative
correlation between LB
max-diﬀ and GAIc-diﬀ (Figure 7), which
means that it is preferable for the performance of the stand
that the genotype with the largest leaves ceases tillering early in
response to the neighboring competition. Furthermore, mixtures
with a diﬀerential of leaf insertion angle are more likely to have
high Ftot values if the genotype with the most erected leaves is
the one with the shortest leaves. Finally, the mean values of HMS
and PARt in the stand should be rather low to allow for high Ftot
values. This means that canopies of short plants with low tiller
regression tend to be the most performant ones.

The addition of new runs of WALTer to the initial LHS
design has conﬁrmed the ﬁrst results. In particular, for the
new simulations as for the ones in the initial design, the
highest values of Ftot are obtained for low values of PARt-ref
(low tiller regression) and for mixtures with a high diversity
in leaf dimensions and in susceptibility to tiller regression
(Figures 8, 9). When considering the initial design, the ﬁve
simulations leading to the highest Ftot values had variable values
of HMS-ref and HMS-diﬀ (Figure 9). However, the ﬁve best-
performing simulations within the 50 new runs added by EGO
all had low HMS-ref values, meaning that high performing

Muller and Martre, 2019; Louarn and Song, 2020; Stomph
et al., 2020). Contrary to previous modeling work on wheat
cultivar mixtures (Vidal et al., 2018; Barillot et al., 2019), this
study focuses on multiple traits and on the entire development
it provides a broader insight
cycle of
into the interactions taking place in wheat cultivar mixtures.
Nevertheless, as for any modeling exercise (Passioura, 1996), our
study presents some approximations that must be considered
when interpreting the results. Indeed, even though WALTer
allows for a realistic simulation of the tillering dynamics in
response to competition for light (Lecarpentier et al., 2019;
Blanc et al., 2021), some of the underlying hypotheses of
the model should be mentioned. First of all,
is the
only environmental factor considered in the model: water and
nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur. . . ) are not
explicitly simulated by the model, even though these factors
are known to impact the development of wheat. In particular,
numerous studies have highlighted the important role of nitrogen
in the regulation of tillering (Sparkes et al., 2006; Assuero and
Tognetti, 2010; Dornbusch et al., 2011; Alzueta et al., 2012)
and taking this factor into account would impact the results.
Simulations are thus made with the hypothesis that resources
other than light are not limiting. Moreover, plasticity was
considered only for tillering, as it is the most plastic trait in
response to competition for light in wheat (Lecarpentier, 2017).
However, considering plasticity of other traits, and especially

light

in leaf dimensions, could lead to diﬀerent results, although
it would come at a higher computational cost. Furthermore,
the results are also aﬀected by the parameterization of the
model. In particular,
light interception was computed using
only diﬀuse radiations, because the simulation of more realistic
sky conditions (i.e., diﬀuse and direct radiations) would be
signiﬁcantly more time-consuming. Sky conditions could have
an impact on our results and additional information could be
provided by the comparison of our simulations with simulations
using only direct radiations (Barillot et al., 2019). Nonetheless,
our preliminary studies (unpublished data) showed that there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the results obtained with
these two conditions when simulating a simple binary mixture.
Finally, even though mixtures cultivated by farmers usually
combine more than two cultivars, our study focuses on the
simulation of binary mixtures, as these simple mixtures allow an
eﬃcient exploration of the relations between plant architecture
and stand performance.

In contrast to these limitations, the strengths inherent in
the modeling approach allowed us to conduct a study that
would have been impossible to achieve experimentally. Contrary
to experimental studies on wheat mixtures (Borg et al., 2018;
Montazeaud et al., 2020), the eﬀect of each architectural trait
the stand could be isolated from
on the development of
any other factor. In addition,
it was possible to vary the
diﬀerent traits independently, without including the existing

correlations between architectural traits, such as the one between
leaf dimensions and leaf inclination (Ma et al., 2020), even
though these biological constraints should be considered when
interpreting the results. The sensitivity analysis combined with
a metamodeling approach allowed us to take advantage of
the complexity of an FSPM while limiting the computational
time required. Thanks to the adaptive design, the uncertainty
associated with the metamodeling approach was accounted for.
Indeed, the addition of new runs of WALTer in areas of the
parameter space that led to high values of Ftot improved the
quality of the metamodel approximation in these areas of interest.

Leaf Dimensions and Tillering Are Major
Drivers of Mixture Performance
Our study highlights the impact of the leaf dimensions and
the tillering capability on the performance of the simulated
mixtures. Indeed, for all the outputs considered, those two traits
were the most inﬂuential ones among the four architectural
traits explored. Leaf dimensions and tillering capability have an
important impact on the plant’s leaf area index (LAI) whereas
leaf inclination and height don’t have a direct impact on the
LAI but rather on the spatial distribution of the leaf area and
on its orientation. Thus, our results suggest that traits impacting
the LAI of plants have more inﬂuence on the performance
of the stand than traits impacting the arrangement of the

leaves. This result is consistent with the well-established eﬀect
of LAI on competition for light interception and productivity
(Pugnaire and Valladares, 2007). Furthermore, it is in agreement
with several studies using FSPMs to simulate trees (Da Silva
et al., 2014; Streit et al., 2016; Perez et al., 2018), or maize
intercropped with soybean (Munz et al., 2018), in which the
traits related to leaf area were identiﬁed as the ones with the
most inﬂuence on light interception. Finally, it is also consistent
with the results of the experimental study of Montazeaud et al.
(2020), in which the tillering capability was shown to have an
important impact on the performance of binary wheat mixtures.
The relatively smaller impact of height and leaf inclination on
stand performance is congruent with the ﬁndings of Munz et al.
(2018) on intercropped maize and with the study of Barillot et al.
(2019) on leaf inclination in wheat cultivar mixtures. However,
even though their impact on mixture performance was less
important than that of tillering and leaf dimensions, plant height
and leaf inclination still had an important impact on some of
the performance indicators. In particular, leaf inclination had
an important impact on the light interception eﬃciency of the
simulated canopies (Lperc) and on its OY. As for the diﬀerential
of plant height between the cultivars in mixture, it was one of the
most important factors inﬂuencing Ftot and the OY of Nears.

Contrary to studies on pure stands or on single plants
(Sarlikioti et al., 2011; Da Silva et al., 2014; Streit et al., 2016;
Perez et al., 2018), we were able to distinguish the eﬀect of the trait

Modeling Wheat Varietal Mixtures

diﬀerential between cultivars from the eﬀect of the mean value of
the trait in the stand, for each trait. Thus, for the leaf dimensions,
the mean value in the canopy greatly impacts the light
interception eﬃciency (Lperc) and the number of ears produced
(Nears), but it is mainly the diﬀerential between cultivars that
inﬂuences the performance of the stand, with a major impact
on all outputs except Lperc. As for the tillering capability, the
diﬀerential between cultivars and the mean value in the stand
both had an important impact on mixture performance. This is
in line with the experimental study conducted by Montazeaud
et al. (2020), in which mixture performance was impacted by
both average trait values and trait diﬀerences. In particular, they
showed an important eﬀect of both the average tillering capability
and its diﬀerential on the OY of grain yield.

Interestingly, modeling studies could guide eﬀorts to address
the lack of experimental data on intraspeciﬁc mixtures. More
precisely, our results suggest that it would be interesting to design
experiments mixing varieties with diﬀerences in leaf dimensions
and tillering capabilities. Although it is diﬃcult to know values of
these traits in wheat varieties (due to the lack of phenotypic data
and the important investment required for the measurements),
this type of experiment could, in turn, help with the biological
validation of the models.

In particular,

Toward the Identiﬁcation of Assembly
Rules
Our results show that the performance of mixtures is very
variable depending on the values of the explored architectural
traits.
the best performances were achieved
by mixing cultivars with diﬀerent architectures, which is in
agreement with numerous studies linking the diversity of
functional traits in plant communities to their productivity
(Reiss and Drinkwater, 2018). However, some of the worst
performances were also achieved by mixing varieties diﬀering
in their aerial architecture and the OY indicators were <1 for a
signiﬁcant proportion of the simulated mixtures. This suggests
that diversity is not a suﬃcient criterion to design eﬃcient
mixtures and that random-trait assembly will not necessarily lead
to better performances than pure stands, as previously stated by
Louarn et al. (2020) for grassland mixtures. Overall, these results
highlight the importance of establishing assembly rules to design
eﬃcient mixtures.

When focusing on the trait conﬁgurations leading to the
best performances, our results converge toward a single mixture
ideotype for the total ﬁtness of the plot (Ftot). Indeed, even if
some parameters can have variable values in well performing
stands, due to their low impact on Ftot, there is no multimodality
in the distribution of the parameters with high impact on Ftot
for the best performing simulations. In particular, regarding the
mean values of traits in the stand, the best-performing canopies
are composed of short plants with low levels of tiller regression.
Interestingly, the fact that stands with short plants perform better
than stands with taller plants is in line with the assumption of a
trade-oﬀ between vegetative development and reproduction. As
a matter of fact, signiﬁcant yield gains have been achieved by
breeding for wheat cultivars with reduced height, as a shorter

stature limits lodging and improves the harvest index (Gale et al.,
1985). In WALTer, the negative correlation between plant height
and stand performance is probably due to the formalism of tiller
regression. Indeed, tiller regression depends on the amount of
light intercepted per unit area, and taller tillers have a larger
surface of internodes and sheaths, which makes them more likely
to regress.

Regarding the diﬀerential of trait values between the two
varieties in the mixture, the best-performing stands are the ones
with an important diversity in both leaf dimensions and tiller
regression. Our results tend to encourage the association of a
very competitive genotype with a genotype with poor competitive
ability, as the genotype with the largest leaves must also be the
one less sensitive to tiller regression in order for the stand to
perform well. This conclusion must however be qualiﬁed as the
cultivar with the largest leaves should also be the shorter one
and the one with the earliest cessation of tillering in response
to the neighboring competition. Thus, in the best-performing
plots, the most productive genotype at maturity was usually
not the one that produced the most tillers. Regardless, the high
Ftot values oﬀered by this trait combination is explained by
the very important productivity gain of the cultivar with the
largest leaves, which outweighs the loss of productivity of the
other cultivar in the mixture. However, it is important to specify
that no plant mortality is considered in WALTer and that all
individuals produce at least one ear, which is not always the
case in experimental settings. In the case of the best-performing
conﬁgurations that were simulated with WALTer, the cultivar
with the smallest leaves had a very low productivity that might
have been even lower in ﬁeld conditions because of potential
plant death or individuals with null productivity. Under such
experimental conditions, the gain of the cultivar with the largest
leaves might not have compensated for the loss in productivity of
the other genotype, thus calling for caution when mixing cultivars
with signiﬁcant diﬀerences in their competitive ability. Moreover,
the results of Montazeaud et al. (2020) showed a negative eﬀect
of diversity in tillering capability on the performance of binary
mixtures of spring durum wheat sown in rows, which is in
contradiction with our results. However, even if the results of our
simulations are not meant to be directly translated into assembly
rules, they improve our understanding of the interactions taking
place in mixtures.

To further improve our understanding, it would be interesting
to consider phenological traits, such as the number of days
in addition to the architectural
to heading or to maturity,
ones. Indeed, diversity in phenology could lead to temporal
complementarity in addition to the spatial complementarity
oﬀered by diﬀerences in traits of
the aerial architecture.
Several studies have emphasized the impact of phenological
traits on the performance of wheat mixtures (Borg et al.,
2018; Montazeaud et al., 2020). However, these traits were
not yet considered in our study because it would require the
integration of a speciﬁc module to WALTer to ensure that
modiﬁcations in phenology and their implication on plant
development are reliably simulated. Future work could also
include the exploration of
the eﬀects of some agricultural
practices. We simulated balanced mixtures (with 50% of each

is expected that both sowing density and the proportions
the two cultivars in mixture should have an impact
of
on the results (Grace and Tilman, 1990). Moreover,
the
sowing density has been identiﬁed, as expected, as one of
inputs in WALTer (Lecarpentier et al.,
the most inﬂuential
2019; Blanc et al., 2021), supporting the interest in exploring
variations of this parameter. FSPMs are particularly adapted to
explore these agricultural practices (Evers et al., 2019; Gaudio
et al., 2019). WALTer could readily be used to consider
the eﬀects of variations in both sowing density and cultivar
proportion as well as their interactions with architectural traits,
albeit with an increased computational cost compared to the
present study.

(2020)

Finally, the trait combinations identiﬁed in this study are
the ones maximizing Ftot, which is a proxy for the number
of grains produced by the stand. However, cultivar mixtures
can provide a wide variety of ecosystem services besides
yield (Barot et al., 2017). Thus,
it would be interesting to
consider multiple objectives as exempliﬁed by the study of

mixtures over time was also considered in addition to yield.
the composition of a mixture
Considering the stability of
over time could also be of interest for wheat, as this crop
is often resown from year to year. The mixtures that we
identiﬁed to maximize Ftot present signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
performance between their two cultivars, which would lead
to a drastic evolution of their composition and possibly to
a decrease in stand performance over time. Further work
with WALTer would be of high interest
to identify trait
conﬁgurations leading to both high performance and mixture
stability over time.
