Abstract. Argumentation, in the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, is a for-
malism allowing to reason with contradictory information as well as to
model an exchange of arguments between one or several agents. For this
purpose, many semantics have been deﬁned with, amongst them, grad-
ual semantics aiming to assign an acceptability degree to each argument.
Although the number of these semantics continues to increase, there is
currently no method allowing to explain the results returned by these
semantics. In this paper, we study the interpretability of these seman-
tics by measuring, for each argument, the impact of the other arguments
on its acceptability degree. We deﬁne a new property and show that the
score of an argument returned by a gradual semantics which satisﬁes this
property can also be computed by aggregating the impact of the other
arguments on it. This result allows to provide, for each argument in an
argumentation framework, a ranking between arguments from the most
to the least impacting ones w.r.t. a given gradual semantics.

Introduction

The issue of interpreting the results obtained by Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) meth-
ods is receiving an increasing attention both in the AI community but also from
a wider audience. In particular, the ability to interpret the rationale behind the
results (e.g., classiﬁcations, decisions) returned by an artiﬁcial intelligent agent
is of main importance to ensure the transparency of the interaction between the
two entities in order to accomplish cooperative tasks. According to Miller [13],
interpretability is the degree to which an observer can understand the cause(s)
of a result. An algorithm, a program or a decision is said to be interpretable
if it is possible to identify the elements or the features that have the great-
est impact on (and thus lead to) the result. This term must not be confused
with the term explanation which is the answer to a why-question or with the
term justiﬁcation which explains why a result is good, but does not necessarily
aim to give an explanation of the process. Despite the numerous (formal and
empirical) approaches [12, 11, 17, 9] to tackle the problem of interpretability of
artiﬁcial intelligent systems, it is still an open research problem. As highlighted

by Mittelstadt et al. [14], artiﬁcial argumentation [3] may play an important role
in addressing this open issue, thanks to its inner feature of combining decision
making with the pro and con arguments leading to a certain decision.

In this paper, we aim to study, from a formal point of view, how to cast the
notion of interpretability in abstract argumentation so that the reasons leading
to the acceptability of one or a set of arguments in a framework may be explicitly
assessed. More precisely, this research question breaks down into the following
sub-questions: (i) how to formally deﬁne and characterise the notion of impact
of an argument with respect to the acceptability of the other arguments in the
framework? and (ii) how does this impact play a role in the interpretation process
of the acceptability of arguments in the framework?

To answer these questions, we start from the family of graded semantics [6,
4], and we select two semantics which present diﬀerent features so that we can
show the generality of our approach to characterise the notion of impact. In par-
ticular, we select the h-categorizer semantics initially proposed by Besnard and
Hunter [5] and the counting semantics from Pu et al. [16]. In both approaches,
the acceptability of an argument, diﬀerently from standard Dung’s semantics [10]
where arguments are either (fully) accepted or rejected, is represented through
an acceptability degree in the range [0, 1]. Roughly, we say that the impact of
a certain argument (or a set of arguments) on the degree of acceptability of
another argument can be measured by computing the diﬀerence between the
current acceptability degree of the argument and its acceptability degree when
the ﬁrst argument is deleted. We study the formal properties of the notion of im-
pact instantiated through these two graded semantics both for cyclic and acyclic
abstract argumentation frameworks. Finally, we show that studying the impact
of an argument on the other arguments allows us to answer to some main needs
in terms of interpretability of argument-based decision maker’s resolutions.

The remainder of the paper is as follows: in Section 2, we provide same
basics about gradual semantics and more precisely, the h-categorizer [5] and the
counting semantics [16], Section 3 discusses the notion of impact of an argument
in an argumentation framework and its formal properties, Section 4 focuses on
the balanced impact property, in Section 5 we highlight how the notion of impact
and its properties play a role on the interpretability of abstract argumentation
frameworks and the acceptability of the arguments. The discussion of the related
literature and conclusions end the paper.

2 Preliminaries

An abstract argumentation framework (AF) is a set of abstract arguments con-
nected by an attack relation.

Deﬁnition 1 (AF). An (abstract) argumentation framework (AF) is a tuple
F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) where A is a ﬁnite and non-empty set of (abstract) arguments,
and R ⊆ A × A is a binary relation on A, called the attack relation. For two
arguments x, y ∈ A, the notation (x, y) ∈ R (or xRy) means that x attacks y.

Deﬁnition 2 (Non-attacked set of arguments). Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF.
The set of arguments X ⊆ A is non-attacked if ∀x ∈ X, (cid:64)y ∈ A\X s.t. (y, x) ∈ R.

Notation 1 Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF and x, y ∈ A. A path P from y to x,
noted P (y, x), is a sequence (cid:104)x0, . . . , xn(cid:105) of arguments in A such that x0 = x,
xn = y and ∀i < n, (xi+1, xi) ∈ R. The length of the path P is n (i.e., the
number of attacks it is composed of ) and is denoted by lP = n. A cycle is a path
from x to x and a loop is a cycle of length 1.
Let R−
n (x) = {y | ∃P (y, x) with lP = n} be the multiset of arguments that are
bound by a path of length n to the argument x. Thus, an argument y ∈ R−
n (x)
is a direct attacker (resp. defender) of x if n = 1 (resp. n = 2). More generally,
y is an attacker (resp. defender) of x if n is odd (resp. even).

A gradual semantics assigns to each argument in an argumentation framework
a score, called acceptability degree, depending on diﬀerent criteria. This degree
must be selected among the interval [0, 1].

Deﬁnition 3 (gradual semantics). A gradual semantics is a function S which
associates to any argumentation framework F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) a function DegS
F : A →
[0, 1]. Thus, DegS

F(x) represents the acceptability degree of x ∈ A.

h-categorizer semantics [5, 15] This gradual semantics uses a categorizer
function to assign a value to each argument which captures the relative strength
of an argument taking into account the strength of its attackers, which itself
takes into account the strength of its attackers, and so on.

Deﬁnition 4. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an argumentation framework. The catego-
rizer function DegCat

: A → ]0, 1] is deﬁned such that ∀x ∈ A,

Counting semantics [16] This gradual semantics allows to rank arguments
by counting the number of their respective attackers and defenders. In order
to assign a value to each argument, they consider an AF as a dialogue game
between the proponents of a given argument x (i.e., the defenders of x) and
the opponents of x (i.e., the attackers of x). The idea is that an argument is
more acceptable if it has many arguments from proponents and few arguments
from opponents. Formally, they ﬁrst convert a given AF into a matrix Mn×n
(where n is the number of arguments in AF ) which corresponds to the adjacency
matrix of AF (as an AF is a directed graph). The matrix product of k copies
of M , denoted by M k, represents, for all the arguments in AF , the number of
defenders (if k is even) or attackers (if k is odd) situated at the beginning of
a path of length k. Finally, a normalization factor N (e.g., the matrix inﬁnite
norm) is applied to M in order to guarantee the convergence, and a damping
factor α is used to have a more reﬁned treatment on diﬀerent length of attacker
and defenders (i.e., shorter attacker/defender lines are preferred).

Deﬁnition 5 (Counting model). Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an argumentation frame-
work with A = {x1, . . . , xn}, α ∈ ]0, 1[ be a damping factor and k ∈ N. The
n-dimensional column vector v over A at step k is deﬁned by,

vk
α =

k
(cid:80)
i=0

(−1)iαi ˜M iI

where ˜M is the normalized matrix such that ˜M = M/N with N as normalization
factor and I the n-dimensional column vector containing only 1s.
The counting model of F is vα = lim
ith component of vα, denoted by DegCS

vk
α. The strength value of xi ∈ A is the

k→+∞

F (xi).

Impact Measure

The impact of an argument on another argument can be measured by computing
the diﬀerence when this argument exists and when it is deleted. To capture this
notion of deletion, we need to deﬁne the complement operator which deletes a set
of arguments from the initial argumentation framework w.r.t. a given argument
(i.e., the targeted argument of the impact). These changes have also a direct
impact on the set of attacks because the attacks directly related to the deleted
arguments (attacking as well as attacked) are automatically deleted too.

Deﬁnition 6. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF, X ⊆ A and y ∈ A. The complement
operator (cid:9) is deﬁned as F (cid:9)y X = (cid:104)A(cid:48), R(cid:48)(cid:105), where

– A(cid:48) = A\(X\{y});
– R(cid:48) = {(x, z) | (x, z) ∈ R and x ∈ A\X, z ∈ A\X}.

Let us ﬁrst formalise how to compute the impact of a non-attacked set of argu-
ments on a given argument before generalising it for every set of arguments.

3.1 Impact of a non-attacked set of arguments

The impact of a non-attacked set of arguments X on the degree of acceptability
of an argument y can be measured by computing the diﬀerence between the
current acceptability degree of y and its acceptability degree when X is deleted.

Deﬁnition 7 (Impact of a non-attacked set of arguments). Let F =
(cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF, y ∈ A and X ⊆ A be a non-attacked set of arguments. Let S
be a gradual semantics. The impact of X on y is deﬁned as follows:

ImpS

F(X, y) = DegS

F(y) − DegS

F(cid:9)yX (y)

Globally, this deﬁnition is implicitly included in the formula of existing grad-
ual semantics. A proof of this is that it is possible to compute the score of
an argument by combining its basic score and the impact of each argument
in the AF: DegS
F(A, y). Figure 1 illustrates this idea where
F(cid:9)aA(a)) = 1−0.7309 = 0.2691.

Fig. 1. On the left hand side, an AF with, above each argument, its scores returned
by the counting semantics (with α = 0.98) and the h-categorizer semantics [CS/Cat].
On the right hand side, the table contains the impact of some non-attacked sets of
arguments on the degree of acceptability of argument a.

Measuring the impact of these sets of arguments could be interesting for
applications like the online debate platforms where people can argue on a given
topic. A debate can be formalised with an AF which has, in many cases, a
tree-shaped structure meaning that several sub-debates exist. For example, the
arguments for/against the vegan diet can be divided into several categories like
the environmental impact, health impact, psychological eﬀects, etc. Checking
the impact of these diﬀerent categories (i.e., the sub-trees in the AF) on the
topic implies to better know the inﬂuence of each part on the debate.

3.2 General impact

As it stands, the formula of the impact (Deﬁnition 7) cannot be used for an
attacked set of arguments. Indeed, calculating the impact of {e} on a in Fig.
1 reverts to compute the impact of {e, f, g} on a because, by deleting e, the
path from f and g (the direct attackers of e) to a are also removed implying to
indirectly take into account the impact of f and g on a too.
In order to compute the impact of any set of arguments X on an argument y,
we propose to consider the degree of acceptability of y when the arguments in
X are the strongest (i.e., when their direct attackers are deleted). The fact that
these arguments are attacked will be taken into account during the computation
of the impact of these attackers on y.

Deﬁnition 8 (Impact). Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF, y ∈ A and X ⊆ A. Let S
be a gradual semantics. The impact of X on y is:

ImpS

F(X, y) = DegS

F(cid:9)y((cid:83)

1 (x))(y) − DegS
R−

F(cid:9)yX (y)

x∈X

This deﬁnition generalises Deﬁnition 7 because if (cid:83)
x∈X

R−

1 (x) = ∅ (meaning

that X is non-attacked) then the two formulae are equivalent.
As the acceptability degree of an argument is between 0 and 1 (see Deﬁnition
3), the impact of a set of arguments on an argument is in the interval [−1, 1].

Proposition 1. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF, y ∈ A and X ⊆ A. Let S be a
gradual semantics. We have ImpS
F(X, y) ∈ [−1, 1].

6

J. Delobelle, S. Villata

Three categories of impact can be deﬁned, i.e., positive, negative and neutral.

Deﬁnition 9. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF, y ∈ A and X ⊆ A. Let S be a gradual
semantics. We say that X has a positive impact on y if ImpS
F(X, y) > 0, X
has a negative impact on y if ImpS
F(X, y) < 0, X has a neutral impact on y
if ImpS

F(X, y) = 0.

Note that the fact that a set of arguments has a speciﬁc impact (positive,
negative or neutral) does not mean that all arguments belonging to this set also
have this speciﬁc impact. For example, in Fig. 1, we can see that, when CS is
used, the set {e, f, g} has a positive impact whereas only e has a positive impact
(f and g have a negative impact).
In order to be used for interpretability (Section 5), we deﬁne three notations
to select the single arguments which have either a positive, negative or neutral
impact on another argument.

Notation 2 Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF and y ∈ A. Let S be a gradual semantics.
I+
S (y) = {x ∈ A | {x} has a positive impact on y}
I−
S (y) = {x ∈ A | {x} has a negative impact on y}
I=
S (y) = {x ∈ A | {x} has a neutral impact on y}.

F ({e}, a) = DegCS

Example 1 Let us compute the impact of each single argument in the AF vi-
sualised in Fig. 1 on a when CS is used (α = 0.98). Focusing on e, we have
F(cid:9)a{e}(a) = 0.4906 − 0.25530 = 0.2353. For
ImpCS
the other arguments, we have ImpCS
F ({d}, a) =
−0.49, ImpCS
Thus, we have I+

F ({c}, a) = 0.2353 and ImpCS
CS(a) = {c, e}, I−

CS(a) = {b, d, f, g} and I=

F ({g}, a) = −0.1108.

F(cid:9)a{f,g}(a) − DegCS

F ({a}, a) = 0, ImpCS

F ({f }, a) = ImpCS

F ({b}, a) = ImpCS

CS(a) = {a}.

4 Balanced impact property

The deﬁnition of a new gradual semantics is often coupled with an axiomatic
evaluation [1, 4]. Such axioms are mainly used to better understand the be-
haviour of gradual semantics in speciﬁc situations. The role and impact of an
argument/attack are also discussed. Such axioms have the aim to answer ques-
tions like: Is an attack between two arguments killing (cf. Killing property [1])
or just weakening (cf. Weakening property [1]) the target of the attack? In ad-
dition, two semantics can both consider that an attack weakens its target (and
then both satisfy the Weakening property) but with diﬀerent levels of weakening.
Unfortunately, this distinction cannot be captured with such axioms.

For example, computing the impact of b and c on a in the three AFs visu-
alised in Fig. 2 with the h-categorizer semantics shows that their impact on a is
less important when they attack together (ImpCat
({b, c}, a) = −0.667) than when
F3
they attack it separately (ImpCat
({b}, a) + ImpCat
({c}, a) = −0.5 + −0.5 = −1).
F1
F2
Conversely, for the counting semantics, both return the same result:
ImpCS
F3

({b, c}, a) = −0.98 = −0.49 + −0.49 = ImpCS
F1

({b}, a) + ImpCS
F2

({c}, a).

Fig. 2. Three argumentation frameworks F1, F2, F3 showing the diﬀerence of impact
among the counting semantics and the h-categorizer semantics.

To capture this idea, we deﬁne a new property, called Balanced Impact (BI),
which states that the sum of the impact of two arguments alone on an argument
y should be equal to the impact of these two arguments together on y.

Property 1 (Balanced Impact (BI)). A gradual semantics S satisﬁes Balanced
Impact if and only if for any F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) and x, y, z ∈ A,

ImpS

F({x}, y) + ImpS

F({z}, y) = ImpS

F({x, z}, y)

Let us check which semantics (among CS and Cat) satisﬁes Balanced Impact.

Proposition 2. The counting semantics satisﬁes Balanced Impact.

Proposition 3. The h-categorizer semantics does not satisfy Balanced Impact.

Thus, this property allows to distinguish the semantics which distribute the
impact of the arguments on another in a balanced way. Interestingly, this bal-
ance allows to go further because it is possible to compute the score of an ar-
gument w.r.t. a gradual semantics which satisﬁes BI from the impact of each
single argument in the AF on this argument. Indeed, as explained in Section
3.1, the score of an argument y depends on the impact of all the arguments in
the AF (ImpS
F(A, y)), but thanks to the balanced impact property, we can split
ImpS
F(A, y) into the impact of each individual argument in the AF. Let us ﬁrst
formally deﬁne it for the acyclic argumentation frameworks.

Deﬁnition 10. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an acyclic AF and y ∈ A. Let S be a gradual
semantics which satisﬁes BI. The score of y can be deﬁned as follows:

DegS

F (y) = 1 +

(cid:88)

x∈A

ImpS

F ({x}, y)

Example 2 Let us compute the score of a in the AF visualised in Fig. 1 using
the impact of each single argument when CS is used.

F ({b}, a) + ImpCS

In order to generalise this deﬁnition for any AF, a preprocessing step is required.
Indeed, deleting an argument in a cycle removes as well its impact as the ones of
other arguments in the cycle. As the method works for acyclic AFs, we propose
to transform a cyclic AF into an inﬁnite acyclic AF1 focused on a given argument
a. Thus, as visualised in Fig. 3, we obtain a tree-shaped AF where the root node
is a itself, its parent nodes are its direct attackers, the parent nodes of its parent
nodes are its direct defenders, and so on. Algorithm 1 details the transformation
mechanism called ACY.

Fig. 3. Cyclic AF transformed into its inﬁnite acyclic AF

We can now use the transformation of an AF, denoted by F, to deﬁne the impact
of any argument x on a given argument y as the sum of the impact of all the
sub-arguments of x (x0, x1, . . . ) on y0 (the universal sink vertex) in ACYy(F).

Deﬁnition 11. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF with y ∈ A. Let F(cid:48) = ACYy(F) and
X = {x0, x1, . . . } be the sub-arguments of x ∈ A in F(cid:48). Let S be a gradual
semantics which satisﬁes BI. The impact of x on y is 0 if X = ∅, otherwise it is

1 From a computational point of view, the scores of each argument are computed using
a ﬁxed-point approach. If the function used in the gradual semantics converges, the
number of iterations needed for convergence can also be used to deﬁne the maximal
depth of the tree-shaped AF.

Interpretability of gradual semantics

One of the goals of interpretability for gradual semantics is to identify the el-
ements which have an impact on the score assigned by the selected gradual
semantics on each argument. Deﬁnition 9 allows to assess whether an argument
has a positive, negative or neutral impact on the acceptability degree of an ar-
gument. It allows to answer questions about the impact of certain arguments on
the others, like in the following example about the AF (F) in Fig. 1:

Q:Which arguments have a positive impact on a in F when CS is used?
A: c and e have a positive impact on a.

I+
CS(a) = {c, e}
Through the impact values (see Deﬁnition 8), it is possible to provide, for each
argument, a ranking between the arguments from the most positive to the most
negative impacting ones w.r.t. a given gradual semantics.

Deﬁnition 12 (Impact ranking). Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF and S be a gradual
semantics. The impact ranking (cid:23)S
y on A with respect to y ∈ A is deﬁned such
that ∀x, z ∈ A, x (cid:23)S

F({x}, y) ≥ ImpS

y z iﬀ ImpS

F({z}, y).

This ranking allows us to select, for each argument, its most positive and negative
impacting arguments, if they exist.

Deﬁnition 13. Let F = (cid:104)A, R(cid:105) be an AF and S be a gradual semantics. The
most positive (resp. negative) impacting arguments on the acceptability
degree of y ∈ A are deﬁned as follows:
P I S
F (y) = argmaxx∈I+
N I S

Example 4 Let us consider the AF depicted in Fig. 1. The impact ranking of
argument a, when CS is used, is c (cid:39)CS
a d.
Consequently, we have P I CS

a f (cid:39)CS
F (a) = {b, d}.

F (a) = {c, e} and N I CS

a a (cid:31)CS

a g (cid:31)CS
a

a e (cid:31)CS

b (cid:39)CS

In addition to providing a better understanding of the scores assigned to each ar-
gument, this information can also be used to develop strategies during a debate.
For example, if someone wants to defend a point of view (i.e., increase the degree
of acceptability of an argument in a debate), she can identify the argument(s)
with the most negative impact and therefore look for solutions to attack them
by introducing some counter-arguments.

6 Related Work

Interpretability has already been studied in the context of extension-based se-
mantics in formal argumentation. Fan and Toni [11] ﬁrst studied how to give
explanations for arguments that are acceptable w.r.t. the admissible semantics
in terms of arguments defending them, before formalising explanations for argu-
ments that are not acceptable w.r.t. the admissible semantics by using a dispute
tree [12]. Although the extension-based semantics and the gradual semantics
share the same goal (i.e., evaluating the arguments), the two approaches are dif-
ferent (see the discussion in [7] for more details). Consequently, the investigation
of the notion of interpretability for these two families of semantics also diﬀers.
Concerning the gradual semantics, Amgoud and al. [2] have introduced the
concept of contribution measure for evaluating the intensity of each attack in
an argumentation graph. The Shapley value is used as contribution measure.
However, only a speciﬁc family of gradual semantics is considered (i.e., the ones
which satisfy the syntax-independent and monotonicity properties like the h-
categorizer semantics). Moreover, unlike our method which checks the impact of
all arguments in the framework, their method only measures the contribution
of direct attacks on an argument which is coherent for the family of semantics
studied in this work, but it is not necessarily the case for all existing semantics.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a formal framework to interpret the results of
gradual semantics in abstract argumentation. More precisely, we have considered
the h-categorizer and the counting semantics, and we have formally studied the
notion of impact of an argument with respect to the acceptability degree of
another argument in the framework both for cyclic and acyclic frameworks. The
impact of arguments on the acceptability degree of the other arguments is then
employed to interpret the rationale behind the resulting ranking, and to provide
a further understanding of the reasons why attacking one argument rather than
another may be a strategically better choice.

Two main open issues will be considered as future work: ﬁrst, in this paper
we do not consider the support relation [8] between arguments but we aim to
extend our formal framework to capture this relation too given its importance
in many practical applications, and second, we plan to extend our analysis to
the other gradual semantics proposed in the literature to provide a complete
overview of the properties of the impact notion over such semantics.
