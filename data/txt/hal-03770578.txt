After introducing a historical view of research ethics and the main schools of thought, the paper is structured 
around two main topics: On the one hand, the protection of the environment surrounding the research experi-
ments conducted, which is a major aspect in food safety related research and includes the staff carrying out the 
research.  On  the  other  hand,  collective  decision  aspects,  which  are  involved  in  the  construction  of  decision 
support systems for food safety enhancement. Based on a few examples in food safety related research, the paper 
reviews the ethical issues considered, the ethical principles applied, and the main measures taken in these cases.   

1. Introduction 

Birth  of  research  ethics  —  Historically,  the  ethical  principles  of 
research emerged as a new formalized field, in the tradition of Hippo-
cratic ethics, with the increasing concerns stemming from biomedical 
research. Their emergence was driven by the need for a balance between 
the benefits expected from the research conducted, and the risks to be 
taken, which in some cases led to major scandals [1]. 

The Nuremberg Code of 1947 first provided formalized safeguards to 
ensure accordance with ethical principles in research practices [2]. The 
various versions of the Declaration of Helsinki [3], promulgated by the 
World  Medical Association since 1964, further developed the Nurem-
berg Code. They introduced in 1975 the need for review and validation 
of research protocols by an independent committee of ethics. Since these 
foundation  stones  of  research  ethics,  numerous  guidelines  have  been 
defined  and  specified for various cases and professions. These  can be 
either  advisory  or  have  the  status  of  legislations  at  the  international, 
national or local level. However, codes and laws regulate practices but 
do not give comprehensive ethical advice. This is where ethical frame-
works come into play. 

Schools  of  thought  in  ethics  —  Different  ethical  frameworks  have 
been  developed.  Among  them,  consequentialism,  deontology-based 
ethics,  and  virtue  ethics  are  major  approaches  [4].  As  its  name  in-
dicates,  consequentialism  refers  to  a  family  of  ethical  approaches 

focusing on  the consequences  or effects  of  an action, i.e.  an action  is 
evaluated with regards to its overall consequences. A classic example of 
consequentialism  is  utilitarianism  [5]  for  which  an  action  is  deemed 
morally good if it maximizes the utility of the society. In contrast to that, 
deontology-based  ethics  regroups  different  approaches  to  ethics  that 
base morality of an action on its compliance with a set of normative rules 
or duties, regardless of their consequences. An iconic example of that 
kind of approaches is the categorical imperative introduced by Kant [6], 
where an action is morally allowed only if it can be elevated as a uni-
versal  law.  Finally,  virtue  ethics  disregard  consequences  or  duties  in 
favor of virtues, i.e. traits of character that are deemed excellent and that 
need to be nurtured. In that sense, virtue ethics is more interested in how 
a life should be lived rather than what is the right action in a particular 
situation —see Vallor [7] for a recent account of virtue ethics. 

The answers provided by the different frameworks do not necessarily 
converge. This raises the issue of how to solve this pluralism in practice, 
which also opened the way for different conciliation strategies. One of 
them, known as “principlism”, is widely referred to in biomedical ethics. 
It is based on both deontology and consequentialism, and lies on four 
principles [8]: respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and 
justice.  As  far  as  we  are  concerned  in  this  paper,  the  principle  of 
beneficence is the very basis of the research conducted to improve food 
safety. Indeed, food safety research aims to benefit consumers by pre-
venting health issues of concern, but also the food industry and public

authorities,  by  improving  efficiency  and  reducing  costs  through  the 
development  of  efficient  high  throughput  technologies,  thus  avoiding 
adverse public health crises and increasing public confidence. As regards 
non-maleficence,  justice  and  autonomy,  these  principles  will  be 
considered in Sections 2 and 3. 

This paper proposes an overview of two ethical aspects which are 
prevalent in food safety related research, namely: 1) The protection of 
the  environment  surrounding  the  experiments  conducted,  which  in-
cludes the research staff carrying out the experiments. 2) The ethics of 
collective decision, which is implied in the cost-benefit balance of the 
choices made to enhance food safety, with the involvement of different 
stakeholders and possibly personal data considerations. These aspects 
are developed in Sections 2.1 and 3.1, respectively. 

2. Protection of the environment surrounding the research 
experiments conducted 

Ethics  related  to  environmental  protection  and  safety  concerns 
research activities that involve the use of elements that may cause harm 
to  the  environment,  to  animals  or  plants,  or  to  humans,  including 
research staff. 

In food safety related research in particular, research labs must be 
aware of the possible harm to the environment caused by the research 
and the measures to be taken to mitigate the risks. Practically, they must 
ensure that appropriate health and safety procedures conforming to the 
legislation are applied for staff involved in the research. 

The  principle  of  non-maleficence  is  followed  here,  that  is  to  say, 

avoiding causing harm is commented in the first example. 

2.1. Example 1 

Description:  a  research  laboratory  carries  out  microbiological  or 
chemical hazard detection and control, involving the use of potentially 
infectious  or  toxic  material  that  might  accidentally  impact  the  envi-
ronment or cause harm to the research staff conducting the experiments. 
Ethical issue considered: The kind of ethical issue that arise in relation 
to microbiological or chemical safety research lies in the risk of envi-
ronmental  health  and  safety  impacts.  The  eventuality  of  accidental 
release  of  chemicals  or  pathogenic  bacteria  in  the  environment,  of 
accidental contact with humans, has to be anticipated. 

In this example, the risk considered primarily goes for the research 
staff  itself  —in  contrast  to  research  subjects  or  the  general  public  in 
other cases. Although researchers may be assumed to have a good un-
derstanding of the risks involved, this is not necessarily straightforward 
when  staff  with  different  levels  of  responsibility,  or  students,  are 
involved. 

Ethical principles applied: This issue is in relation to the precautionary 
principle. Initially introduced in policies for environmental protection, 
the precautionary principle has now been much extended. Indeed, ac-
cording to the European Commission, the principle additionally refers to 
potentially harmful effects on human, animal or plant health [9]. The 
principle states that in case an activity introduces a risk of harm, adapted 
measures  should  be  taken  to  prevent  or  limit  that  harm,  even  in  the 
absence of a precise assessment of the risk level. 

To a lesser extent, and in addition to the precautionary principle, the 
issue considered is also in relation to the notion of informed consent. 
This is the most basic requirement originating from the Nuremberg Code 
[2]. Characterized as the most authoritative set of rules for the protec-
tion of human subjects in medical research, the Nuremberg Code has not 
been  entirely  adopted  as  law  by  any  nation,  nor  as  official  ethics 
guidelines  by  any  major  medical  association  [10].  However,  its  basic 
requirement of informed consent has been integrated as international 
law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [11]. It is 
also  the  basis  of  the  International  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects, promulgated by the World Health 
Organization [12]. 

In  reference  to  this  requirement,  in  case  a  research  activity  in-
troduces  a  risk  of  harm,  the  research  staff  are  supposed  to  have  con-
sented  to  their  involvement.  Thus,  measures  to  be  taken  include 
ensuring that the staff participating has a good understanding of the risk 
and ability to carry out the research adequately with regard to the risk. 
Measures  to  be  taken:  legislations and  guidelines,  defined  from  the 
international and national levels until the local level at the scale of the 
lab, regulate the intake, storage, registration, handling and management 
of hazardous material. See to this regard. United Nations and WHO’s 
position  [13,14].  The  protocols  required  include  in  particular  the 
training of the staff to good laboratory practices, decontamination and 
waste  management  procedures,  appropriate  human  protection  equip-
ment  (gloves,  masks,  safety  glasses,  lab  coats),  use  of  biological  and 
chemical hoods. Thus, to summarize, the security measures rely, on the 
one  hand,  on  informational  means,  including  training  and  procedure 
display, and on the other side on physical and chemical barriers to limit 
the risk of spread. 

3. Ethics of collective decision 

Addressing  societal  issues  such  as  public  health  management 
through food safety control, involves several stakeholders with different 
visions of the system, different expectations from the research carried 
out, and possibly conflicts of interest [15]. Supporting decision-making 
in such a multi-actor context implies some ethics of decision and relies 
on the principle of justice in decision-making, since different points of 
view  have  to  be  reconciled  [16].  In  the  case  of  food  safety  related 
research,  experts  from  different  disciplines  are  involved  (e.g.  food 
safety, nutrition, food processing), various stakeholders are consulted (e. 
g.  consumers,  food  companies,  public  authorities,  researchers).  In 
bottom-up hazard control performed by food companies and top-down 
hazard  control  performed  by  food  safety  authorities,  there  is  a  com-
mon  responsibility  and  interest  in  preventing  public  health  problems 
related to the food chain and a common investment in the food chain 
safety.  Nevertheless,  expectations  regarding  the  research  carried  out 
may differ. On the move towards modernized hazard control methods, 
food  companies  would  possibly  prioritize,  as  essential  criteria, 
high-throughput tools and cost-efficiency for self-monitoring in routine 
use,  ease  of  implementation,  and  affordable  initial  investment  costs; 
while on the other hand, for safety authorities, the method capacity to 
discover unsuspected hazards could be salient. 

When  choices  have  to  be  made,  whatever  the  method  used  to 
reconcile viewpoints (e.g. using risk-benefit analysis and multi-criteria 
decision [17,18], it is based on underlying decision principles. Unfor-
tunately, it is a well-known issue with voting rules (ways of making a 
decision  based  on  the  aggregation  of  stakeholders’  preferences)  that 
none is perfect and each one of them has some defects [19]. Importantly, 
the choice of the voting rule might impact the decision that is made, a 
decision  that  consequently  might  misrepresent  the  preferences  of  the 
actors. It is thus a matter of justice to acknowledge the bias associated 
with the decision-making mechanism that is chosen and try to address it. 
Example 2 addresses these considerations. 

3.1. Example 2 

Description. A decision support system is designed to analye the costs 
and benefits of different food safety management strategies (which risks 
should be high-priority, which technologies should be chosen, etc.) by 
bringing in the views of the stakeholders concerned. 

Ethical issue considered: The issue considered is the risk of providing 
an  unequal  representation  of  the  different  viewpoints  in  the  decision 
process. 

Ethical principles applied: This issue refers to the principle of justice in 
research. It is an issue known to the research community, especially in 
participatory  approaches  [20,21],  that  the  research  process  itself  in-
duces concerns about: (i) The fair representation of the different groups 

GlobalPediatrics2(2022)1000162R. Thomopoulos et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

and  stakeholders,  offering  the  opportunity  for  all  viewpoints  to  be 
expressed, and avoiding under- or over-representation of certain groups. 
(ii) The possible influence of the researchers themselves on the decision 
process, which should be avoided by keeping a neutral posture. These 
concerns are also shared with other research communities, in particular 
operational  research,  which  produced  a  rich  literature  on  the  subject 
[22]. 

Measures to be taken — Although this issue is inherent to any decision 
process,  adopting  a  formally  well-defined  decision  methodology, 
explainable  and  interpretable,  is  a  way  of  best  addressing  the  issue. 
Moreover, providing the possibility to actors to understand and discuss 
the  different  aspects  of  the  collective  decision,  will  promote  under-
standing and cohesion between the actors. 

In  addition  to  the  ethical  issues  raised  by  the  decision  process, 
another related well-known issue in ethical guidelines is the respect of 
privacy. With the participation of different stakeholders representative 
of a range of situations and interest in the society, comes the question of 
the possible collection of personal data. Example 3 illustrates this issue. 

3.2. Example 3 

Description.  A web survey  is  launched in  order  to collect  the per-
ceptions of end-users –parents, early childhood professionals, healthcare 
professionals– concerning the safety of infant food products. 

Ethical  issue  considered:  The  issue  considered  is  the  risk  of  uncon-
sented collection of personal information, in particular data allowing for 
the identification of a person, such as names, emails, IP addresses, etc. 
Ethical principles applied: The ethical principle involved is the respect 
of privacy [23]. A recent approach to define privacy is to associate it 
with  the  protection  of  personal  information.  As  it  is  the  case  in  this 
example, this definition of privacy relates it to digital concerns such as 
data protection, at a time where data are valuable goods. This concept of 
privacy  covers,  on  the  one  hand,  the  right  to  prevent  others  from 
obtaining information about oneself; on the other hand, the right to have 
control  on  information  about  oneself  that  may  be  registered  e.g.  on 
computers. Thus, privacy can be seen as part of the autonomy principle, 
in the sense that it refers to the right to decide whether and how data 
originating from oneself are used. With this broad meaning, privacy may 
not be exclusively restricted to identifiable data, but more generally to 
information about individuals. Views are however divergent about the 
scope of privacy [24]. 

Measures to be taken: The protection of personal data is regulated at 
the European level by the General Data Protection Regulation and by the 
Directive (EU) 2016/680 [25]. In the present example, the collection of 
identifiable data, if unnecessary for the study, can be completely avoi-
ded. Technically, this implies in particular the choice of a survey tool 
that allows the survey designer to block the collection of IP addresses. 
However, in case the study necessitates the collection of data that can, in 
some manner, allow one to identify the respondent, then participants 
should  be  informed  beforehand  and  provide  their  consent.  But  even 
without the possibility of identifying the respondent, or in the case of 
anonymized data, good practices suggest to provide adequate informa-
tion  to  the  participants.  Researchers  would  thus  state  any  significant 
risks, the purpose of the research, any financial interests and external 
research funding, the opportunity to ask questions or to change one’s 
mind,  all  items  that  directly  arise  from  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki 
statements. 

4. Conclusions 

This paper illustrates the challenge of adopting best practices for an 
ethical  research,  in  the  domain  of  food  safety.  Even  in  a  restricted 
domain of research, it can be noted how diverse the issues raised are. 
Indeed, Section 2 addressed some issues related to the protection of the 
environment  surrounding  experimental  research  on  food  safety, 
including the research staff. This is probably the most straightforward 

aspect  of  ethics  in  food  safety  related  research.  On  the  other  hand, 
Section 3 illustrates how food safety related research becomes a societal 
issue when it comes to decision about food safety management. In this 
case, very different concerns are raised, in the field of ethics of decision- 
making and personal data protection. 

By  highlighting  miscellaneous  concerns  regarding  good  practices 
and  ethical  issues  in  food  safety  related  research,  this  paper  aims  at 
increasing awareness within academia, industry and other stakeholders, 
about the variety and complexity of research ethics and its tight imbri-
cation with legislation.
