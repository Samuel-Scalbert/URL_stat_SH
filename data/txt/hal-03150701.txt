Abstract

1.  Building reliable species distribution models (SDMs) from presence- only informa-

tion  requires  a  good  understanding  of  the  spatial  variation  in  the  sampling  ef-

fort. However, in most cases, the sampling effort is unknown, leading to biases in 

SDMs. This study proposes a method to jointly estimate the parameters of sam-

pling effort and species densities to avoid such biases. The method is particularly 

suited to the analysis of massive but highly heterogeneous presence- only data.

2.  The proposed method is based on estimating the variation in sampling effort over 

units of a spatial mesh in parallel with the environmental density of multiple spe-

cies  using  a  marked  Poisson  process  model.  Based  on  simulations  with  realistic 

settings, we examined the performance and robustness of parameter estimations. 

We also analysed a large- scale citizen science dataset with highly heterogeneous 

sampling (Pl@ntNet), including around 300,000 occurrences of 150 plant species.

3.  We found that sampling effort was correctly estimated when the true sampling ef-

fort was constant within the cells of a spatial mesh. Estimation bias arose when sam-

pling  effort  and  environmental  drivers  strongly  covaried  within  cells.  Otherwise, 

the  inference  was  correct  and  robust  to  sampling  variation  within  cells.  Running 

the model on real occurrences of 150 plant species provided an estimated map of 

relative sampling effort for 15% of French territory. We also found that the density 

estimated for an exotic invasive plant was consistent with prior data.

4.  This is the first method jointly estimating species densities depending on environ-

ment, and sampling effort as an explicit spatial function, from occurrence data of 

multiple species. An asset of the method is that a few frequently observed species 

greatly contribute to correctly estimate sampling effort, thereby improving density 

estimation of all other species. This approach can thus provide reliable SDM for

2.5 | Application to a real dataset

We  also  fitted  the  model  to  real  occurrences  recorded  in  the  Pl@

ntNet  query  dataset  (Botella  et  al.  2019).  The  occurrences  in  this 

dataset  were  collected  by  citizens  using  the  Pl@ntNet  mobile  ap-

plication  (Joly  et  al.,  2016).  They  were  automatically  identified  by 

the Pl@ntNet AI engine. Details on the identification system and the 

database infrastructure of Pl@ntNet are provided in Affouard et al. 

(2017). The dataset is publicly available on the open- access reposi-

tory  Zenodo  (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2634137).  The  code 

for  extracting  occurrence  and  environmental  data  and  fitting  the 

model is provided in the code repository accompanying this article 

(Botella, 2020).

We fitted the model for the 50 species with a spatial mesh of rec-

tangular  cells  with  (0.1,  0.1)  dimensions  in  (longitude,  latitude), 

or  approximately  (8,  11)  in  kilometres.  Thus,  except  for  the  case
