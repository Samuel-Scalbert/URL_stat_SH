Introduction 
Rhizodeposits, defined here as any organic materials released by living roots, can represent 
up to 15% of net amount of carbon (C) photosynthesized by a plant (Pausch and Kuzyakov, 
2018).  Rhizodeposits  have  been  shown  to  play  an  important  role  in  plant  growth  through 
various  mechanisms (e.g.  by favoring  water  uptake through mucilage  secretion,  or  nutrient 
uptake through the exudation of soluble compounds), and to represent a major contributor to 
the  formation  of  stable  soil  organic  matter  -  and  thus  to  the  mitigation  of  climate  change 
through soil C sequestration. Decomposing rhizodeposition into its elementary processes (e.g. 
exudation, mucilage secretion, cells sloughing) is required for a better understanding of the 
response  of  rhizodeposition  to  various  environmental  constraints  and  of  its  associated-
benefits.  While  many  works  have  attempted  to  quantify  the  exudation  of  soluble  organic 
compounds at the scale of  a plant or the net rhizodeposition of  C in soils, very few studies 
have been able to estimate the amount of mucilage or sloughed cells released by a whole root 
system over time. Consequently, while it has been claimed that the amount of soluble organic 
C  is  much  higher  than  the  amount  of  C  released  as  mucilage  or  sloughed  cells  by  roots 
(Nguyen, 2003; Rees et al. 2005), the relative importance of distinct rhizodeposition processes 
in plant’s and soil’s C balance remains largely unknown. While the comparison of mucilage 
secretion and citrate exudation within a FSPM has been recently attempted (Landl et al. 2021), 
no model has been developed so far for simulating such rhizodeposition processes as part of 
plant’s  C  management.  The  present  work  aimed  to  give  a  better  assessment  of  the 
contribution of distinct rhizodeposition processes to the total amount of organic C released by 
roots, for different plant species, growth stages and environments. 

Modelling approach 
We used the recently developed root model RhizoDep, which aims to simulate rhizodeposition 
over time and space as a function of plant’s environment. Its originality lies in the calculation 
of  a full C balance in each part of the root system, which enables to simulate physiological 
processes (e.g. growth, maintenance and rhizodeposition) in a plastic way, depending on the 
variations  of  root  sugar concentrations  (Figure 1). Three  distinct  rhizodeposition  processes 
have  been  implemented:  the  exudation  of  soluble  organic  compounds,  the  secretion  of 
mucilage  and  the  sloughing  of  root  cells.  The  present  version  also  explicitly  considers  the 
dynamics  of  root  hairs,  as  it  may  significantly  influence  rhizodeposition  processes,  e.g.  by 
changing root external surface. Model’s parameters were taken from literature or recalculated 
from  published  data. The  amount  of  C allocated to the root  system  over  time,  which  is  the 
major input variable of the model, was either estimated from literature data or simulated by 
the wheat FSPM CN-Wheat (Barillot et al. 2016; Gauthier et al. 2020).

Simulations & first results
We simulated the amount of C released by roots from species that contrast in terms of root 
architecture and rhizodeposition (e.g. wheat, oilseed rape, faba bean). Simulations were done
for  different  growth  stages  and  environmental  conditions  (e.g.  nitrogen  availability,  light 
availability and soil mechanical impedance). Our results show that the exudation of soluble 
compounds is predominant compared to other rhizodeposition processes, but the secretion of 
mucilage and the release of cells are substantially increased in certain situations. Mucilage 
secretion or cells sloughing had until now been investigated only at the scale of a single root 
and  over  periods  of  a  few  hours.  Our  work  shows  that  FSPM-modelling  offers  a  unique 
opportunity to integrate these processes at plant’s scale over the whole growth period, while 
considering various environmental influences on root growth and rhizosphere processes.
