Abstract

The use of naturalist mobile applications have dramatically increased during last years, and
provide huge amounts of accurately geolocated species presences records. Integrating this
novel type of data in species distribution models (SDMs) raises specific methodological
questions. Presence-only SDM methods require background points, which should be con-
sistent with sampling effort across the environmental space to avoid bias. A standard
approach is to use uniformly distributed background points (UB). When multiple species are
sampled, another approach is to use a set of occurrences from a Target-Group of species
as background points (TGOB). We here investigate estimation biases when applying TGOB
and UB to opportunistic naturalist occurrences. We modelled species occurrences and
observation process as a thinned Poisson point process, and express asymptotic likelihoods
of UB and TGOB as a divergence between environmental densities, in order to characterize
biases in species niche estimation. To illustrate our results, we simulated species occur-
rences with different types of niche (specialist/generalist, typical/marginal), sampling effort
and TG species density. We conclude that none of the methods are immune to estimation
bias, although the pitfalls are different: For UB, the niche estimate fits tends towards the
product of niche and sampling densities. TGOB is unaffected by heterogeneous sampling
effort, and even unbiased if the cumulated density of the TG species is constant. If it is con-
centrated, the estimate deviates from the range of TG density. The user must select the
group of species to ensure that they are jointly abundant over the broadest environmental
sub-area.

How sampling heterogeneity and species niches bias presence only SDM through background points selection

environments and space, for ecological studies and conservation planning. Popular examples
of such methods include ENFA ([2]), GARP ([3]), Maxent ([4]) and more recently Bayesian
methods ([5, 6]). Large amounts of presence-only data have become available through the digi-
tization of herbarium collections ([7, 8]) and the development of citizen science, and they
should improve estimation accuracy in SDM. However, sampling effort is heterogeneous and
often depends on environment, yielding estimation biases in SDM ([9]). These biases are not
alleviated when increasing occurrence data and require the development of methods acknowl-
edging sampling heterogeneity.

While first presence-only SDM methods like BIOCLIM ([10]) and DOMAIN ([11]) aimed

at computing environmental ranges where the species could live, recent methods ([12]) look
for more accuracy, and estimate the species density across environment. This density is pro-
portional to the species expected abundance regarding only the environment. To estimate this
species environmental density, such methods use a set of “background” or “pseudo-absences”
points (or “quadrature” points in literature on Poisson process models, see [12], which should
reflect the sampling intensity across the environmental space. Background points are usually
drawn uniformly over the region, assuming a uniform sampling of the focal species distribu-
tion (default option in Maxent). However, this assumption is inadequate in most cases. Indeed,
the occurrences are mostly collected without a strict sampling protocol. People visit more cer-
tain places than others, e.g. because they are closer from where they live, easier to access, bio-
logically interesting, or aesthetically attractive. This geographic bias translates into an
environmental bias, i.e. the global sampling effort that is induced by the sum of observers
covaries with the environment. For instance, Fig 1 shows the that distribution of opportunistic
observations of the mobile app Pl@ntNet in 2017 ([13]) is higher in lower-elevation areas. For
a species specialized to mountain ecosystems, small populations at lower elevation could be
over-sampled. When inferring an SDM with a uniform background, species occupancy at
higher elevation would be under-estimated and the estimated niche would thus be biased
toward lower elevation.

Presence-only data has evolved in availability and format. Indeed, thanks to large scale citi-
zen-sciences programs like iNaturalist (https://www.inaturalist.org/), eBird (https://ebird.org/
home), Pl@ntNet (https://plantnet.org/) or Naturgucker (https://www.naturgucker.de/),
spreading the use of smartphone applications for reporting naturalist observations ([14]), pres-
ence-only data become massive in developed countries and geolocation of individual speci-
mens becomes more accurate. In the past, most presence only data came from experts
collections: Natural museums, naturalist surveys, conservatories data or environmental agen-
cies. Observations of species presences were often aggregated to a prospection site geolocation,
which spatial coverage is unknown and varies between sites. The Target-Group Background
method (TGB) was proposed by [15] to correct for sampling bias in presence-only niche mod-
els in this context. It proposes to define background points as the sites where there has been at
least one presence among a Target-Group of species. Today, almost each species presence
reported from a mobile phone has its own geolocation and to aggregate them a posteriori in
sites asks specific methodological questions. A simpler, and slightly different method is to inte-
grate all species occurrences from the Target-Group as background. Of course, this procedure
has strong links with the original TGB approach, but while TGB requires sampling effort to be
homogeneous between sites to work properly, as noticed by [16] (page 429), the other method
might better correct for a varying sampling effort because the concentration of occurrences
from all TG species sounds more proportional to the prospection pressure in the area.

In this study, we propose a new theoretical investigation of specific advantages and biases of
this approach, that we will call Target-Group Occurrences Background (TGOB) in the follow-
ing. A basic problem is that the density of occurrences in the TG might be a poor

approximation of the real sampling effort, because it does not only reflect sampling effort but
also the varying species densities and ecological preferences of species in the TG. Thus, using
Target-Group occurrences background may entail new estimation biases in SDM. However,
there is no comprehensive perspective on the conditions leading to such bias. Here we address
which properties of sampling effort and which ecological characteristics of species in TG can
entail biases in (i) an analysis with uniform background points, and (ii) an analysis with Tar-
get-Group occurrences background.

PLOS ONEHow sampling heterogeneity and species niches bias presence only SDM through background points selection

Poisson process are useful models for presence-only SDM because they enable a clear prob-
abilistic model and inference procedure for estimating the species environmental density. We
consider Poisson process models with log-linear intensity function, which includes the most
popular Maxent model ([17]). Starting from a model of species occurrences based on a thinned
Poisson process where the thinning intensity is heterogeneous in space and represents the
sampling effort, we first exhibited the induced Poisson process in the environmental space and
showed how its intensity factorizes into the species intensity and the sampling effort averaged
over space for any environment. We then re-expressed the expected density estimator as a
divergence depending on focal species density, TG species density and observation density.
We assessed how estimation biases arise when these densities are environmentally heteroge-
neous. We simulated basic cases where estimation biases are expected, for different types of
sampling effort, varying niche types of the focal species (specialist vs generalist, typical vs mar-
ginal optimum), and three levels of niche breadth in TG species. We show that using back-
ground points drawn from the sampling effort proportional density is asymptotically
unbiased, and show two types of bias related to alternative ways of defining background points:
(i) a bias due to a mismatch of background points with actual sampling effort in the uniform
background selection scheme, (ii) a bias due to ecological preferences of TG species, but irre-
spective of sampling heterogeneity, in TGOB.

To our knowledge, this is the first study bringing such theoretical insights to characterize
sampling-related biases in presence-only SDM. Our results should help SDM users anticipate
those biases, and decide whether they can use uniform, TGO backgrounds, or orientate them
towards other methods and complementary data. Guidelines are provided for building the TG.
It should guide good practices for performing more reliable presence only habitat models.

In section 2, the model of species distribution and observation is described, we introduce
the form of the point process intensity in the environmental space and the observation inten-
sity factor. In section 3, the simulation and inference settings are described. In section 4,
detailed results are provided and finally, in section 5, they are discussed in order to provide
guidelines for modelers.

2 Model of species observations

We introduce here a probabilistic model controlling the random generation of species located
occurrences. It is a two step process where (i) species individuals locations are distributed
according to a Poisson point process (see section 2.2), (ii) the individuals are partially observed
through a random thinning operation (section 2.3). Section 2.3 also introduces an intermedi-
ary result, showing how the expected density of occurrences in the environmental space factor-
izes with an observation density factor that will be crucial to determine the bias of species
density estimation. Before anything else, section 2.1 introduces some notations used all along
the article, and the reader may find all notations are summarized and explained in Table 1.

2.1 Notations

We define a measured two dimensional space ðD; LðDÞ; mÞ, where LðDÞ is the Lebesgue σ-
algebra over D, a bounded subset of R2, and μ is the Lebesgue measure on R2, which can be
understood as the standard measure of area. Individuals of a species are represented by
points distributed over D, and only a part of them is reported by observers. Over this
domain we consider an environmental variable that is represented by a measurable
function x : D ! R, continuous almost everywhere and bounded. We note
ImðxÞ ¼ fw 2 R; 9z 2 D; x is continuous at z and xðzÞ ¼ wg. Then, 8W � R, we note
x−1(W) = {z 2 D, x(z) 2 W}. We deal here with a single environmental variable x for clarity,

over R. The almost continuity of x means that μx(Im(x)) = μ(D), i.e. the spatial area over
which x is continuous equals the area of D, or said differently, the area of all points of dis-
continuity of x taken together is null. This hypothesis allows us to deal either with a continu-
ously varying variable (e.g. defined by a mathematical function over space), or a locally
discontinuous one, typically like raster environmental data (see for example [18] for a
review on commonly used environmental variables in plants SDM), and even a mixture of
both. For example, x could be the elevation variable illustrated by Fig 1. Thus, this hypothe-
sis makes our analysis quite general regarding x.

2.2 Distribution model

Species individuals are represented by the random set Z of their positions in D. We assume Z
is distributed according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process over D with intensity function
lox : D ! Rþ, where o is functions composition. The intensity λ depends on the environmen-
tal variable x. We assume it is continuous almost everywhere on R, has bounded values on any
bounded subset of R and note: Z * IPP(λox(.)). Poisson process have indeed been proposed
and used as natural probabilistic models for the distribution of species individuals in space
([12, 16]). The intensity represents the punctual limit of the expected species abundance per
space unit. We note, 8w 2 R; f ðwÞ ¼ lðwÞ

, a formal definition of the ecological concept of

the species response function to variable x ([19, 20]). It can be seen as the probability density
function of the random environmental variable x(z) of any individual random location z inside
a virtual geographic space where all possible environmental values of x are equally represented
in terms of area (this is not necessarily the case in D). In short, we call f the species density.
The inhomogeneous Poisson process model proposed here represents a broad class of pres-
ence-only SDM including the popular Maxent model, even though Maxent further uses a L1
penalty for model selection. This regularization was not integrated in the study as it doesn’t
change the incidence of sampling bias.

2.3 Observation model and observation density along the environmental
gradient

We use a probabilistic model of observation in order to study the effect of heterogeneous sam-
pling effort on bias. It is similar to the models used in [4, 15, 16, 21]. We consider a continuous
sampling effort function s: D ! [0, 1]. For any point z 2 D where an individual of some spe-
cies is located, the probability to report it is s(z). Note that s is not a probability density over D.
There is, of course, no occurrences apart from true locations of individuals. Under this model,
the thinning property of inhomogeneous Poisson process ([22]), called Prekopa’s theorem,
states that reported presences of the species Zr are distributed according to Zr * IPP(s(.)λ � x
(.)). To understand more clearly sampling bias on estimated niche, we propose to look rather
at the environmental space rather than the geographic space. Indeed, we are especially inter-
ested in the bias of the estimated species density, which is a function of the environmental vari-
ables. However, estimation bias will depend on the sampling effort, which is defined over the
geographic space but may be transposed to the environmental space. Our first and intermedi-
ary result (proved in Text A of S1 Appendix) is that the distribution of the observed species
individuals in the environmental space R also follows a general Poisson process ([22, 23])
l�sdmx and intensity l�s. Where �s is defined by Eq 1. This
whose measure is, for any W 2 R,
intensity function lðwÞ�sðwÞ in environment w represents the expected number of occurrences
on any spatial unit where the environment is constant and equal to w, given the underlying
shape of the sampling effort s. We show that it is the product of the species intensity λ and the
average of the sampling effort �s across all areas of D with the given environment. This factori-
zation appears because the species intensity is a function of x.

To clarify and illustrate the practical consequences of the mathematical results presented in
section 4, we carry out a simulation experiment exhibiting the estimation biases in various sce-
narios. In the following, UB denotes the estimation of a Poisson Point Process model with uni-
form background, and TGOB the Target-Group occurrences background alternative. We
simulate large samples of observed points of a focal species under contrasted scenarios of focal
species density and observation density shapes. We also generate a large set of alternatively
uniform or Target-Group background points, with various shapes of species cumulated den-
sity for the latter. We carry out the species density model estimation from the given focal spe-
cies observed points and background points. We finally plot the estimated density,
approximating the expected estimation, against the true one and the observation density along
the enviromnental variable axis. For UB, we also plot the focal species occurrences, that is the
theoretically expected density estimate, while for TGOB we plot the TG species cumulated

density shape and the theoretically expected density estimate. This experimental procedure is
summarized in diagram of Fig 2. This part presents each step of the simulation scheme and
technical settings.

3.1 Environmental variable
We consider a square spatial domain D = [−5, 5]2 where the environmental variable x is a lin-
ear gradient from west to east, such that x(z) = z1. In this setting, μx is equal to the restriction
of the R-Lebesgue measure to Im(x) = [−5, 5], i.e. each x value has the same spatial extent, and
thus the estimate will not be better in most represented values. Illustrations of the density
derived from μx, Im(x), an observation density and species density (see further) are provided
in S1 Fig.

3.2 Focal species

The species density f is the probability density function of the environmental value of a speci-
men random location. We model it with a Gaussian function, which is a standard assumption
related to the representation of species distribution over environmental gradients ([19, 24]).
We give some insights about the underlying model assumptions in Text B of S1 Appendix.
The mean of f is called μ0, it is the environmental optimum of the species, and we take
μ0 2 {−1, −4} (typical vs marginal). Besides, σ0 is the standard deviation, or the niche breadth
of the species, and we take σ0 2 {0.6, 1.5}, for a specialist or generalist species. We thus simulate
4 virtual species. f is illustrated in each graph of Fig 3.

3.3 Types of observation density

We want to estimate the density of the focal species from reported points. We examine how
the bias in estimated intensity is related to sx, the observation density in Im(x). We define sev-
eral shapes for sx in Im(x), which is illustrated with the yellow curve in each graph of Fig 3:

(latitude) in our simulation setting, which enforces sx αs and we thus control the shape of sw
through the shape of s over the longitude.

3.4 Target group of species

TGOB method uses occurrences from a set of species called the Target Group (TG) as back-
ground points in the inference setting (see methods implementation below). We thus simulate
the TG occurrences background by generating occurrences of N independent species, consti-
tuting the TG, through their observed intensities. For species i, its local observed intensity
takes values liðxðzÞÞ�sðxðzÞÞ; 8z 2 D (assuming constant detection in space), and regrouping
occurrences of all TG species is equivalent to drawing points with a global intensity

3.5 Simulating observation points

Statistical theory insures that the density estimate will converge towards its expectation when
increasing the size of the sample. Then, for all simulations, we generate a very large sample of
points (occurrences and background) so that the estimate approximates well this expectation,
insuring that the estimation error is completely due to bias and not the randomness of the
sample. To generate points according to a Poisson process of intensity function f on Im(x), we
first determine an upper bound B of f on Im(x). Then, we repeat (i) Draw a point z * U(D),
(ii) Draw a variable y * U([0, B]), (iii) We accept z if y <= f(x(z)) and (iv) If 20000 points are
accepted, finish the procedure, otherwise go back to (i). This algorithm is applied to the focal
species observed points, target group observed points and background points (see next sec-
tion). 20000 points were enough for convergence of all estimates in UB and TGOB.

3.6 Computation of models and software

In the UB method, we estimate the model parameters with the standard maximum likelihood
approach. We use the Poisson process likelihood approximation of [25], which transform the

4 Results

We present results on estimation biases for UB and TGOB methods based on both a mathe-
matical analysis and simulation. Our main results are formal Eqs (2) and (5) which express the
target of the density estimate in the environmental space as a function of the true focal species
density f, the observation density sx (for UB) or the cumulated TG species density a (for
TGOB) given the generative model described in section 2. Estimation bias then depends on
the instanciation of f and sx for UB, or of f and a for TGOB. We qualitatively describe the bias,
i.e. the estimated density deviation compared to the true one, that will appear depending on
the shape of the dependent densities: The observation density (for UB in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5,
4.6 and for TGOB in 4.8), the focal species density (for UB in 4.3, and for TGOB in 4.9, 4.10)
and the Target-Group species density for TGOB (4.8, 4.9). This qualitative description are
based on interpretation of Eqs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. This qualitative description of bias is numeri-
cally illustrated with several simulated scenarios. Graphs of all simulated scenarios are repre-
sented in S2 Fig for UB, and S3, S4 and S5 Figs for TGOB. R scripts for running the
simulations and generating the graphs can be found in at https://github.com/ChrisBotella/UB-
and-TGOB. Results are presented here for a single environmental variable. In the case of sev-
eral environmental variables x1, . . ., xp, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence used in the fol-
lowing equations is simply applied to densities over the multidimensional space, with adapted
definitions for sx1;...;xp
. For simplifying notations, we will possibly mean, by the nota-
tion of a function, a product or a quotient of functions, the density associated with it on its def-
inition space, and this in all that follows. For example, fsx refers to the proportional density

4.1 UB: Niche estimate minimizes KL divergence from observed density

We show in Text D of S1 Appendix that the expectation of the parameters estimates of the UB
method is:

Eð^yUBÞ ¼ argminy Dmx

KLðfsxjjfyÞ

ð2Þ

Eq 2 means that the estimated species density f^y UB

will fit the observed environmental
density fsx as close as possible within the parametrization constraints in term of the KL
Divergence with measure μx (μx-almost everywhere). For example, in our simulation model,
is Gaussian, so it cannot fit perfectly to fsx which is non-Gaussian (see graph B of Fig 3),
f^yUB
but achieves the best Gaussian approximation. However, in the case where sx and f are two
Gaussian densities with distinct means and variances, fsx will also be Gaussian [26]. Thus,
will exactly converge to fsx (see graph H of Fig 3). However, it has a different mean and
f^yUB
variance from f, so that the UB estimate is biased. A Complementary explanation about the
significance of μx for the KL-Divergence, and its consequences are given in Text E of
S1 Appendix.

4.2 UB: Bias is small for small variations of observation density over the
species niche

UB bias is tightly linked to the concentration of the observation density in the environmental
space but this concept of concentration is hard to define. Still, as a density get less concentrated
it get closer to a uniform density, and its variation get close to zero everywhere. Thus, we study
the effects of variations of sx and f on bias, we propose an explanation of the bias behavior
observed in simulation through a simple analysis based on the density functions derivatives.
For this purpose, both density functions are assumed to be differentiable over Im(x), which is
true in the simulation setting, except in the case of observation type CUT. Eq 3 shows that
when sx varies little, the observed points density sx f, which is fitted by the UB estimate, will get
close to the true species density f.

Fig 3A confirms that UB is not biased when observation density is constant: The species
true density f (red curve) is equal to the observed point density sx f (green curve), which is per-
fectly fitted by the UB estimated density (blue curve). Even for graph D, the gap between true
and estimated density is very small. This behavior is explained by Eq 3: If linearly decreasing
observation density varies slowly, i.e. max|@sx/@x is close to zero, the derivative of the target
@fy0 sx � fy0
=@x is close to the derivative of the species true density, implying that the estimate
will fit this density. In addition, in environments where species specimens are rare, very low
observation density doesn’t affect the global estimate. Type CUT illustrates this: There is
almost no bias for μ0 = −4 (graph C of Fig 3), as the observed species density (green curve) is
very close to the true species density (red curve). We note as a side remark that the differentia-
bility of sx over Im(x) is not necessary. It depends on complex conditions on x and s. As a
counter example, continuity of sx doesn’t even have a standard sense if x is defined by a geo-
graphic raster. Indeed, Im(x) is then discrete set of x values taken over the raster cells, and �s is
only defined on these values which don’t include any continuum of real numbers. The differ-
entiability is only assumed here to analyse the effects of sx variations in a simplified context.

4.3 UB: Smaller bias for more specialist species

The comparison of the graphs G (specialist) to H (generalist) in Fig 3 shows that the bias on
niche optimum and breadth estimates is stronger for the generalist species. Indeed, we deduce
from Eq 4 that fsx approaches sx as the variation of f over Im(x) decreases.

We can thus say that for a generalist species, the variation speed of sx is high compared to

the one of f, and UB estimate will fit more the observation density than the species density.

4.4 UB: Over-estimated specialization when sampling effort is
concentrated

When the observation density is highly concentrated in a restricted range of the environment,
as with the type GS, UB estimates that the species is more specialized than it is actually (see
graphs G and H of Fig 3). The estimated niche variance is then lower than expected.

4.5 UB: Strong deviations from optimum

Graphs B and H in Fig 3 show that, when the observation density is concentrated far from the
optimum of the species density, we get a strongly deviated estimated optimum. This might be
very misleading for ecological analysis. Estimation of graph H suggests that the species is the
most abundant in a range where it is actually cryptic.

4.6 UB: Sampling marginal specimens means over-estimating generalism

Graph F of Fig 3 shows that when the observation is more intense in the margin of the species
niche, UB over-estimates the niche breadth of the species. This case represent observers having
more interest in reporting a species out of its typical environment.

4.7 TGOB: Integrating samples from a Target Group of species

Firstly, using the same analytical approach as previously, we show in Text F of S1 Appendix
that drawing directly background points from the sampling effort proportional density
R
s/
D s(z)dz give unbiased species intensity estimate. This answers an open question of [4] who
introduced this theoretical method (called ApproxFactorBiasOut in the article). Unfor-
tunately, we rarely have directly access to a true sample from the sampling effort distribution.
An interesting alternative is to use Target-Group species occurrences as background points
(TGOB), i.e. making the hypothesis that those occurrences are approximately drawn from the
sampling effort proportional density. We will investigate biases occurring with this method
and a necessary and sufficient condition on Target-Group species to avoid them under our
modeling hypothesis. In the following, we introduce an equation showing the displaced target
of the TGOB estimator. It shows how the cumulated TG species density, especially when it is
concentrated in restricted environments, can bias the estimated focal species density. We have
a target group of N species whose individuals are distributed independently according to the
species model described above, and reported from the same area D with the probability of
observation s (same as the species of interest), giving for each of them a set of observation
locations ðZiÞi2½j1;ntg j�. 8i 2 ½j1; Nj�; Zi � IPPðs li � xÞ. We assume a constant detection proba-
bility of individuals across space for any species conditionally to observation. Then, the global
set of Target Group observations locations is Ztg ≔ [i2½j1;Nj� Zi � IPPðs a � xÞ, where

ð5Þ

The proof is given in Text G of S1 Appendix. If 8w 2 Im(x), a(w) > 0, we can set fθ ≔ f/a to
cancel the divergence. Eq 5 means the TGOB estimate is expected to fit to density f/a, which is
independent of the observation density, but depends on the cumulated TG species density.
This result leads to the following consequences described in sections 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10.

4.8 TGOB: If a is constant, TGOB is unbiased
We can see that when a is constant, sx a α sx. Thus, the background points are distributed
according to the sampling effort, and TGOB yields an unbiased estimation as
ApproxFactorBiasOut. This is true whatever is the observation density. We illustrate
it in two cases of Fig 3: μ0 = −1;σ0 = 1.5; CUT with graph J and μ0 = −4; σ0 = 1.5; GS with
graph K. Here the TGOB estimator approaches almost perfectly the true species density,

PLOS ONEHow sampling heterogeneity and species niches bias presence only SDM through background points selection

correcting well for unbalanced observation density in both cases, while in those same cases
UB gives a strongly biased estimate. Furthermore, even with non constant a, the different
types of observation density never affect TGOB. The bias is only due to the Target Group
species density. For example, graphs I and L of Fig 3 show that TGOB estimator do not
change in two very different observation density situations, HOL and GS, but with the same
species density {μ0 = −1, σ0 = 1.5} and TG.

4.9 TGOB: The estimate deviates from a peaky Target Group species
density

The more the Target Group species density (a) is concentrated in some range of x, the more
our niche estimate will be located outside of this range. It may entail an over estimation of
niche breadth, a bias in optimum, or even an hyper-concentration on the borders. To show
this, we can analyse the effect of the variation speed of a and f, by again assuming that they are
differentiable over Im(x) and examining the derivative of f/a:

If a gets high in a neighborhood v of Im(x), we will have f/a ! 0 on v, and @f =a
@x

tends to 0 as
well. Our estimate then becomes flat and low on v as it fits to f/a. In parallel, a is low outside of
v because it must integrate to 1. Therefore, in Im(x)\v, we will have f/a ! + 1, and its deriva-
tive becomes important with the same sign as (cid:0)
. In summary, as a concentrates in a neigh-
borhood v, our TGOB estimate becomes flat and low on v, while it increases outside of v, with
bigger slopes where a varies. This expulsion phenomenon entails bias in optimum and vari-
ance estimation. Thus, the magnitude of bias depends on the concentration of a, but also on
the marginality of the optimum of the focal species (μ0) compared to the one of the Target-
Group. Indeed, the graphs I and M of Fig 3 show that when the species optimum is close to the
one of the TG density (typical species), the niche breadth is over-estimated. There is also a
small deviation in optimum because the focal species is not centered around the TG optimum.
In other words, the focal species density overlaying with the cumulated TG species density is
deviated outside in the estimate. On the contrary, when the species optimum is far from the
cumulated TG species density optimum (marginal species, see graph O of Fig 3), or when the
cumulated TG density is just more concentrated (compare graph N to I in Fig 3), the situation
is worse. The estimate cancels on the range of the cumulated TG species density, while it gets
hyper-concentrated outside. In summary, the more the Target Group of species has a global
environmental preference and the focal species is marginal, the more its niche estimate will be
dispersed, or expelled, out of this environment.

4.1 TGOB: Stronger bias for generalist species

When comparing graph M to N in Fig 3, we see that TGOB is more biased on generalist spe-
cies. For a generalist species, the estimate is more expelled from the TG species density volume.
Thus, generalism of the focal species increases bias in both UB and TGOB, but the cause of
bias differs, respectively, the heterogeneity of observation density and the TG global density.
As UB fits the product of f and sx, TGOB does the same with the product of f and 1/a, and the
latter varies in (cid:0)

a2 because the variation of f is small.

5 Discussion

In this study, we have explained two types of bias related to the way to define background
points: the sampling selection bias in UB and the the TG definition bias in TGOB. The for-
mer case concerns the way background points reflect sampling heterogeneity, while the latter
case concerns the influence of ecological preferences in TG species.

Concerning UB, our results confirm some empirical results in Maxent literature. The niche

estimate will fit to the product of the focal species and observation densities. A major conse-
quence is that bias is stronger for generalist species. Bias is also strong when the sampling effort
is concentrated towards places representing a restricted range of environmental values, which
happens when observers have specific preferences towards these restricted conditions. This
will overestimate species specialization. Conversely, observing a species more intensively at the
margin of its niche leads to overestimate niche breadth.

If the Target-Group is well selected, the method Target-Group occurrences background
does account for varying sampling effort. A well selected Target-Group means that the sum of
Target-Group species intensities is constant across environments. However, it is biased when
this cumulated intensity of TG species varies in the environmental space, e.g. when there is
some systematic environmental preference among TG species. In this case, the magnitude of
bias will depend on the concentration of the TG density (depending on the TG species), the
generalism of the focal species, and the marginality of its niche compared to the TG density.
As the TG species density gets more concentrated compared to the focal species niche, the
niche breadth will be over-estimated, and ultimately focal species density will strongly deviate
from TG density. If TG species density approaches 0 faster than the species of interest in some
environmental range, TGOB estimator should dramatically increase there, overriding varia-
tions elsewhere. Including the focal species in the Target-Group should partly prevent the
niche expulsion effect because at least background points from the focal species will cover its
niche. Also, the ecological niche of the focal species plays an important role. A generalist spe-
cies is more affected by bias, as well as species with marginal niche compared to the TG den-
sity. On the contrary, when applied to a non-marginal focal species, TGOB will overestimate
the niche breadth, or from another point of view, the effect of corresponding covariates will be
reduced. This covariate effect cancellation will be all the stronger with Maxent ([27]) because
of its Lasso regularisation. We recommend to carefully chose Target Group of species so as to
insure, at least, that there are TG occurrences in the widest environmental subspace associated
with the study domain. It will insure that at least one of the TG species is present in any kind
of environments. Generalist species over each environmental variable should be included if
possible to overall decrease the variation of the cumulated TG species density. The modeler
must avoid using TGOB if presences of the focal species reach marginal environments com-
pared to the whole Target-Group distribution.

Alternatives methods to TGOB and UB to account for sampling bias in presence only
SDMs may be more suited in certain situations. [28] proposed to model sampling effort with
distinct environmental variables from the species intensity (e.g. distance to roads or to cities).
Thus it removes species intensity bias due to the covariation of sampling effort and species
intensity covariates. However, often some covariates influence both sampling and species den-
sity. Still, our results support this approach if the sampling effort variation along its dedicated
covariates is stronger than the species intensity variation (Eq 4), and the species intensity varia-
tion along its covariate is stronger than the sampling effort variation (Eq 3). Besides, for mod-
elers who can access complementary systematic survey data, integrated models combining
occurrences and presence-absence data have been developed in [16] and [29] with the same

goal. In the same spirit, models combining presence-background with site-occupancy data
([30]) may be another efficient way to account for sampling bias.

We underline that our results directly concern a vast class of presence-only SDM called
Poisson process models ([12]) whose intensity function is strictly positive. Indeed, modelers
may use different variables transformations as predictors (GAM [31], MARS [32]), or learn
those transformations automatically, like with deep neural networks ([33]). Qualitatively
speaking, bias behaviors extend to L1 penalized Poisson process methods like Maxent ([34])
and to other related SDMs methods (whose predictive function is based on covariates) when
using pseudo-absences, e.g. GARP ([3]), ENFA ([2]), or BRT ([1]). Models integrating interac-
tions effects between species, called joint SDMs ([35]), should be similarly affected by
described biases, as species interactions are assumed independent of the environment, but a
specific investigation on biases of such methods would be important in view of the recent
attention they are receiving in ecology. We notice that potential biases of the studied methods
are not restricted to the ones presented here, and the modeler must be careful to other sources
of errors. For example, other authors recently studied how the interaction of environmental
variables resolution and niche breadth induce bias ([36]). Besides, model errors might not be
due to biases, but rather to estimation variance which is also investigated in the SDM literature
([37, 38, 39]). A limitation of this study is that we did not study some other proposed sampling
bias correction methods, such as occurrence thinning procedures, in spatial ([40, 41]) or envi-
ronmental ([42]) domains. As occurrences thinning increases the entropy of the observed
points density, it brings its own bias which should be investigated more closely. Such proce-
dures could be studied through the formalism that we are developing.

TGOB is exactly equivalent to TGB, proposed by [15], if each TG site (defined either by the

environmental rasters or the spatial aggregation of the occurrences) contain only one occur-
rence. However, it may differ significantly when many occurrences are aggregated on sites. If
so, TGB will be biased by a varying prospection intensity between sites and varying TG den-
sity, while TGOB may be biased only by the latter factor. In this context, the strengths of
TGOB would be leveraged by the search for a criterion to select the best Target-Group of spe-
cies, which guarantees a low variation of the cumulated TG species density in the environment.
The difficulty is that such criterion must be computable from the sets of occurrences of species
eligible for the Target-Group. This is an open problem and an area for future work, leading to
a clear and reliable background points selection method applicable by SDMs end users.
