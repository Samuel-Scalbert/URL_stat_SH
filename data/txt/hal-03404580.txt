Abstract

The unprecedented mobilization of scientists, consequent of the COVID-19 pandemics, has

generated an enormous number of scholarly articles that is impossible for a human being to

keep track and explore without appropriate tool support. In this context, we created the

Covid-on-the-Web project, which aims to assist the access, querying, and sense making of

COVID-19 related literature by combining eﬀorts from semantic web, natural language

processing, and visualization ﬁelds. Particularly, in this paper, we present (i) an RDF

dataset, a linked version of the “COVID-19 Open Research Dataset” (CORD-19), enriched

via entity linking and argument mining, and (ii) the “Linked Data Visualizer” (LDViz),

which assists the querying and visual exploration of the referred dataset. The LDViz tool

assists the exploration of diﬀerent views of the data by combining a querying management

interface, which enables the deﬁnition of meaningful subsets of data through SPARQL

queries, and a visualization interface based on a set of six visualization techniques

integrated in a chained visualization concept, which also supports the tracking of

provenance information. We demonstrate the potential of our approach to assist

biomedical researchers in solving domain-related tasks, as well as to perform exploratory

analyses through use case scenarios.

1 Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemics motivated the scientiﬁc community from numerous ﬁelds

of research to contribute in a common eﬀort to study, understand and ﬁght the severe

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several datasets covering the

publications about COVID-19 and related coronaviruses and diseases have been compiled

to support the scientiﬁc community. Particularly, we focus on the COVID-19 Open

Research Dataset (CORD-19) (Wang et al., 2020), which gathers over 500,000 scholarly

articles, including over 200,000 with full text. This deluge of ever-increasing publications in

such a short time frame suggests that it is impossible for any researcher to examine every

publication and extract relevant information from it without appropriate support. To help

researchers to ﬁnd publications of interests, we employ information visualization techniques

to explore the dataset and identify relationships among publications that indicate those

that are worthy of further examination.

In collaboration with biomedical researchers from the French Institute of Medical

Research (Inserm)1 and the French National Cancer Institute (INCa)2, we created the

Covid-on-the-Web project, which gathers expertise from various research ﬁelds (i.e.,

semantic web, natural language processing, and visualization) to assist the exploration of

the COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature. Through a series of interviews with our prospect users,

we could identify a set of meaningful use case scenarios, such as determining the right

amount of certain substances in the patients’ organism using baseline information collected

from scientiﬁc articles, analyzing clinical trials to make evidence-based decisions, studying

of the relationship between coronaviruses and other diseases (e.g., cancer), identifying the

types of cancers that are likely to occur in COVID-19 victims, among others. Whilst some

scenarios require exploring the relationship between components (e.g., cancer and

coronavirus), others require representing trends (e.g., probability of cancer in COVID-19

victims) and analyzing speciﬁc attributes (e.g., details about metabolic changes caused by

COVID-19). Furthermore, the analysis of co-authorship is relevant to health research as it

allows to assess collaboration trends and identify leading investigators and

organizations (Fonseca et al., 2016). In this paper, we focus on using visualization to assist

the resolution of user queries based on the relationship between components and

co-authorship networks, which allow to answer user queries such as “where are researches

in a particular topic being performed?”.

We present two contributions of the Covid-on-the-Web project to the exploration of

COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature. The ﬁrst contribution refers to the Covid-on-the-Web RDF

dataset, a linked version of the CORD-19 corpus, enriched via entity linking and argument

mining. Currently, the Covid-on-the-Web RDF dataset includes and enriches over 100,000

full-text scholarly articles from the 47th version of the CORD-19 corpus, which corresponds

to 1.3 billion RDF triples describing the articles’ metadata, an argumentation and a named

entities (NE) knowledge graph. The second contribution correspond to LDViz3, a

visualization tool that enables the exploration of the COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature from

diﬀerent perspectives, such as co-authorship, named entities co-occurrence and the

relationship between claims and evidences within publications. We demonstrate the

potential of LDViz to support the exploration of customizable SPARQL result sets

extracted from the Covid-on-the-Web dataset to assist the resolution of diﬀerent

domain-related tasks.

Although there have been previous contributions in exploring the CORD-19 corpus

through entity linking approaches (e.g., Oniani et al., 2020; Reese et al., 2021), to the best

of our knowledge, the Covid-on-the-Web dataset is the ﬁrst to integrate NEs, arguments

and PICO components into a single, coherent whole. Furthermore, we propose an uniﬁed

pipeline (Figure 1) that facilitates the extraction and visualization of information from the

CORD-19 corpus by continuously producing and publishing an enriched linked data

knowledge graph. Also, our visualization approach diﬀers from previous solutions to

explore the COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature (e.g., Hope et al., 2020; Verspoor et al., 2020), by

supporting the exploration of meaningful subsets of data suitable to users’ needs through

the deﬁnition of custom SPARQL SELECT queries and via multiple, complementary

visualization techniques; and by allowing the user to trace back their exploratory path,

which help them to understand how they have arrived to a certain outcome.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents previous

data mining and visualization approaches to explore the CORD-19 corpus. Section 3

describes the extraction pipeline to process the CORD-19 corpus and generate the RDF

dataset and presents the characteristics of the dataset and the available services to exploit

it. Section 4 describes LDViz, which usage and exploration potentials are demonstrated

through use case scenarios in Section 5. Section 6 discusses future applications and

potential impact of the dataset. Finally, section 7 concludes this paper.

2 Related Work

Since March of 2020, when the CORD-19 corpus was ﬁrst released, we have seen

multiple eﬀorts towards its analysis and mining through diﬀerent tools and for various

purposes. We have seen initiatives ranging from ad-hoc data releases to the repurposing of

large existing projects. Thus, in this section, we will present previous works related to the

exploration of the CORD-19 dataset in terms of data enrichment and visualization.

2.1 Data Enrichment

Entity linking is usually the ﬁrst approach for processing or enriching a dataset,

which we can observe in several initiatives throughout the literature, such as: the

CORD-19-on-FHIR (Oniani et al., 2020) project, which transforms the CORD-19 corpus in

RDF following the HL7-FHIR interchange format and annotates articles with concepts

related to conditions, medications and procedures; the KG-COVID-19 (Reese et al., 2021)

project, which seeks the lightweight construction of KGs for COVID-19 drug repurposing

eﬀorts; and the CKG-COVID-19 (Ilievski et al., 2020) project, which seeks the discovery of

drug repurposing hypothesis through link prediction.

These solutions restrict processing to title and abstract, while we process the full

text of the articles with Entity-ﬁshing, thus providing a high number of NEs linked to

Wikidata concepts. Furthermore, these solutions are mostly focused on biomedical

ontologies, resulting in NEs strongly related to genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, phenotypes

and publications, while we extend the scope of ontologies to include DBpedia and

Wikidata, resulting in named entities that go beyond the biological domain to extend the

scope of analysis. Furthermore, we integrate argumentation structures and named entities

in a coherent dataset.

2.2 Visualization Approaches

The Covid19-PubAnnotation4 repository gathers text annotations regarding the

CORD-19 corpus and other COVID-19 datasets. The annotations are recovered from

multiple sources and aligned to the canonical text that is taken from PubMed and PMC

archives, which link annotations to each other. Furthermore, the platform provides simple

visualization that allows one to view the annotations directly on the text and further

explore them through interaction.

The SciSight (Hope et al., 2020) tool enables exploratory search of COVID-19

scientiﬁc literature and supports browsing through networks of biomedical concepts and

research groups. It automatically extracts textual and co-authorship network information

from publications, which are then explored through multiple views: a collocation explorer

based on a non-ribbon chord diagram is used to represent the association between terms

co-occurring in the same sentence; the relationship between patient characteristics and

interventions (P and I from PICO elements) can be explored through two coordinated bar

charts, which also display the temporal distribution of publications related to those criteria

through a time series chart; and a network diagram represents the relationship between

groups of co-authors deﬁned either by social (shared authors) or topical aﬃnity.

The COVID-SEE (Scientiﬁc Evidence Explorer for COVID-19) interface (Verspoor

et al., 2020) enables the visual exploration of documents from the CORD-19 corpus

through three diﬀerent views: a sankey diagram displays the relationship between PICO

concepts and allows to retrieve the documents where these relations occur; a topic view

shows the representative topics of the selected documents and their distribution according

to certain coherence measures; and a word cloud view displays the representative concepts

of a document.

The SemViz (Tu et al., 2020) interface uses semantic visualization to explore the

publications within the CORD-19 and other COVID-19 datasets. It provides three

visualization techniques: a tag cloud gives an overall view of the most important concepts

within the data; a heat map represents a pairwise relationship between selected entities in

the article abstracts and journal names; and a data table is used to represent indexed

document data, such as sentences of biomedical relations and corresponding PubMed URLs

that link to the full article.

Sukla et al., 2021 propose a visualization interface that allows the user to explore a

set of publications from the CORD-19 corpus retrieved via textual querying. It displays

the list of articles related to the query, which corresponding named entities can be further

explored through a tag cloud chart and a co-occurrence map.

Bras et al., 2020 combine advanced data modeling of large corpora, information

mapping, and trend analysis to provide a browsing and search interface for discovering

topics and research resources within the CORD-19 dataset. The system provides a cluster

visualization displaying all resources in the dataset, where the user can select a resource to

explore its related topics, descriptions, trend analysis, and documents.

The CovidExplorer (Ambavi et al., 2020) is a multi-faceted AI-based search and

visualization engine that integrates search and recommendation, statistics, and social

media discussions to support the exploration of scientiﬁc articles from the CORD-19

dataset. It comprises a query interface that supports keyword-based search of authors,

papers (title), and full-text papers; and a named entity recognition system which computes

indicators of ﬁrst mention of entities, popular co-mentioned entities, and year-wise

distribution of mention frequencies. These indicators are visualized through a timeline

chart and a sankey diagram, which shows the co-occurrence of entities within publications.

The system provides yet a spatio-temporal visualization of tweets regarding COVID-19.

Although we ﬁnd several visualization tools to support either the exploration of

linked data in general or the COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature, as the ones presented above,

most of them support the exploration of raw data (i.e. the RDF graph, OWL or RDF

Schema), which is interesting for certain tasks such as exploring relevant concepts of an

application domain via ontology representation, inspecting RDF Graphs, and analyzing

instances based on their types/classes. Thus, we propose a ﬂexible tool to enable users to

deﬁne meaningful datasets via SPARQL SELECT queries applied to any SPARQL

endpoint (illustrated here via the Covid-on-the-Web dataset), so that they can explore

multiple aspects of RDF datasets and the LOD Cloud. It also allows users to perform

exploratory searches using various complementary visualization techniques instantiated on

demand according to the task at hand, instead of a single visualization technique that

represents the whole dataset, restraining the analysis to a single view to the data. Our

approach is also based on a visualization concept that enables users to track their

exploratory path to help them to understand how they arrived to a certain outcome and to

allow them to explore alternative hypotheses generated on the ﬂy through diﬀerent

exploratory paths. Furthermore, the visualization together with the additional extractions

(i.e. named entities, arguments, etc) we perform in the Covid-on-the-Web dataset, enables

a deep and semantic-aware exploration of the topics and claims of the COVID scientiﬁc

corpus by leveraging the combination of semantic processing and exploratory search.

3 The “Covid-on-the-Web” Dataset

In this section, we describe the Covid-on-the-Web dataset which we produced from

processing and analyzing the CORD-19 corpus. The dataset cohesively integrates the

results of two mining processes: (1) a named entities (NE) extraction and linking that

deﬁne the links between the CORD-19 articles and major public datasets of the Web of

Data, and (2) an extraction of argumentative components discovered in the articles. These

are both represented as RDF knowledge graphs described hereafter.

3.1 The CORD-19 Named Entities Knowledge Graph

The CORD-19 Named Entities Knowledge Graph (CORD19-NEKG) represents NEs

identiﬁed and disambiguated in the articles of the CORD-19 corpus using three tools:

DBpedia Spotlight (Daiber et al., 2013) to disambiguate NEs against DBpedia entities; the

articles and NEs in RDF. We use DCMI6, FaBiO7, the Bibliographic Ontology8, FOAF9,

and Schema.org10 to represent article metadata such as the title, authors and DOI, and the

Web Annotation Vocabulary11 and Provenance Ontology12 to represent and trace the

recognized entities. These include the text segment recognized as the NE, the location of

the segment within the article’s text, the resource URI (e.g., from Wikidata) linked to the

NE, and the part of the article wherein the NE was recognized (i.e., title, abstract, or

body). Figure 2 presents an extract of the RDF model, which full description together with

examples is available in the project’s Github repository.13

3.2 The CORD-19 Argumentative Knowledge Graph

The ACTA (Argumentative Clinical Trial Analysis) (Mayer et al., 2019) tool was

originally designed to help clinicians make decisions in evidence-based medicine by

automatically extracting argumentative components and PICO elements14 from clinical

trials. Through multiple NLP steps, ACTA retrieves the argumentative components in the

trial and its PICO elements, classiﬁes the components into claim (concluding statement)

and evidence (observation or measurement), and infers the relationship between the

components (i.e., support or attack). For instance, “a new treatment is considered more

eﬀective than existing treatments (claim), as attested by the measure of certain biological

markers within the tested population (evidence)”.

The models used in ACTA are trained with SciBert, a language model for scientiﬁc

text, that has been shown to work on texts from diﬀerent application domains (Beltagy

et al., 2019). While the content of articles might diﬀer from clinical trials, the structure of

the abstracts is similar, including elements such as background, methods, results, and

conclusions. Thus, since arguments can be extracted from abstracts not necessarily dealing

with clinical trials and PICO elements detection can be generalized to every biomedical

article, we re-purposed ACTA to also annotate the articles from the CORD-19 corpus.

Thus, we analyzed every abstract and translated the result into RDF to create the

CORD-19 Argumentative Knowledge Graph (CORD19-AKG), which represent the

argumentative components through the Argument Model Ontology (AMO)15, the SIOC

Argumentation Module (SIOCA)16 and the Argument Interchange Format17. Further, the

PICO elements are described as annotations of the argumentative components in a similar

way to the NEs and disambiguated against UMLS concepts and semantic types.

3.3 Publishing and Querying Covid-on-the-Web Dataset

The Covid-on-the-Web dataset has a DOI and can be downloaded from Zenodo18. It

can also be queried through our public SPARQL endpoint19. The RDF dataset embeds

detailed metadata describing licensing, authorship, provenance, interlinking, and access

information, and the vocabularies used.20 Additional information regarding reproducibility

and sustainability have been detailed and discussed in Michel et al., 2020.

4 Linked Data Visualizer

The Linked Data Visualizer is a generic visualization tool for the Semantic Web of

Linked Data. It enables the exploration of custom subsets of linked datasets deﬁned via

SPARQL queries. Figure 3 provides an overview of the LDViz architecture. It comprises a

querying management interface, where users can manage predeﬁned queries, by viewing,

editing and visualizing their results, as well as cloning them to create new queries. The

interface contains a query editing form, where the user can type their own queries. Upon

submitting a query, the obtained results undergo a transformation process, which output

data corresponds to the expected format for the visualization. The user can then explore

the resulting data using the MGExplorer visualization framework.

In this section, we describe the operational mode of LDViz with particular focus to

the querying management and the visualization interfaces. We further demonstrate the

versatility of LDViz to explore the Covid-on-the-Web dataset through a set of use case

scenarios presented in Section 5.

4.1 Query Management Interface

The query management interface (Figure 4) allows users to create and edit their

own SPARQL queries. In Figure 4a, we can see the menu that lists and allows managing

259

260

COVID-ON-THE-WEB

14

predeﬁned queries, while Figure 4b-e depicts the interface areas enabling the edition and

customization of queries. This interface also enables the preview and exporting of a query’s

results (see Figure 4f). These can be visualized via the MGExplorer graphic library and/or

exported as JSON ﬁles containing either the results in the SPARQL JSON format or the

transformed results used as input of the visualization. The user can type the query in a

text area, which can include customizable parameters speciﬁed through HTML forms, such

as the publication date. Upon submitting a query, the results are processed by a

transformation engine that converts the SPARQL JSON format into the JSON format

expected by the graphic library.

The transformation engine is generic enough to support the exploration of diﬀerent

variables of the dataset. This ﬂexibility allows to explore graphs with diﬀerent topology

(e.g., with nodes featuring publications, authors, named entities, etc.). In the context of

LDViz, this is made possible by using a SPARQL query that requires at least three

variables: ?s and ?o, which describe the nodes (e.g., authors or named entities) related by

a particular document identiﬁed by a variable ?p. An alternative to ?s, ?o is the variable

?author which contains a list of authors. In addition to these variables, the system allows

three other reserved variables that serve to describe the edges (?p) of the output graph

visualization: ?type, ?label, and ?date. The variable ?type can be used to type the edges

of the output graph (e.g., by publication type). Due to human’s perceptual and cognitive

limits towards visualizations, only a certain number of graphic elements can be drawn on

the screen. Thus, we allow the variable ?type to be bound to only four diﬀerent values

describing the edges. When it is bound to more than four distinct values in the SPARQL

query result, the system automatically determines the three more relevant ones based on

the number of bindings and classiﬁes the remaining values as "Other". The ?label variable

allows to provide a description of edges in natural language (e.g., the value of rdfs:label

properties describing resources). Finally, the ?date variable is used to provide a visual

representation of the distribution of edges over time (e.g., publication year).

When dealing with a new dataset, researchers often have to debug and test multiple

queries to discover the contents of the dataset. For the purpose of easing the customization

288

289

COVID-ON-THE-WEB

16

of queries and the use of the interface by the domain expert, we provide query templates

that allow one to interactively deﬁne the value of certain parameters, such as publication

period and named entities of interest (see Listing 1 for an example).

A Graph Style Sheet language (GSS) serves to transform the default node-link

diagrammatic representation through the declarative speciﬁcation of visibility, layout and

styling rules applied to its nodes and arcs (Pietriga, 2006). Based on this concept, we

associate each query to a GSS that the user can edit (see Figure 4e) to customize the

resulting node-link diagram (see Listings 2 and 3 for an example). Further to modifying

the colors and shape of nodes and edges, we enable, through the GSS, the linking of

external services to the visualization interface as a way of extending the analysis. For

instance, the Corese engine (Corby et al., 2012) is a RDF processor that enables among

others the production of new knowledge through inference rules. Thus, one could include

this service on the GSS, which would allow the exploration of the visualized resources

through the Corese engine. Further, we can use this feature to support on-the-ﬂy

exploration of argumentative graphs of publications identiﬁed throughout the visual

exploration process by including the ACTA service (see Subsection 5.5 for more details).

Although we demonstrate the usage of the querying and visualization interfaces for

exploring the Covid-on-the-Web dataset, LDViz can be used to query and visualize data

from any SPARQL endpoint. The querying form contains a ﬁeld where the user enters the

endpoint URL, and the only requirement is that the query returns values for the

above-listed predeﬁned set of variables. Hence, what we propose with LDViz is a generic

visualization tool for the Semantic Web of Linked Data.

As for any visualization, user queries must be translated to a query language that

recovers the necessary data from the database to solve the exploratory task. In this paper,

the user queries were identiﬁed during interviews with users from INCa and Inserm and

translated into SPARQL queries by data scientists. Thus, the query management interface

intends to help expert users (developers and data scientists) to create suitable SPARQL

queries for exploring the dataset. However, expert users such as biomedical researchers do

not need to know SPARQL for visualizing and interacting with the results of queries.

Indeed, they may beneﬁt of a public vitrine21 simply by selecting a predeﬁned query to

explore the results with MGExplorer without having to deal with SPARQL expressions

(Figure 5). The visibility of the predeﬁned queries in the vitrine is settled when queries are

created at the query management interface. In the next section, we describe how users can

interact with the data resulting of those queries by means of an information visualization

interface.

4.2 Visualization Interface

As mentioned earlier, LDViz uses the MGExplorer (Multidimensional Graph

Explorer) (Menin, Cava, et al., 2021) graphic library to support the visual exploration of

the Covid-on-the-Web dataset. More than a collection of charts, MGExplorer is a

visualization tool based on the concept of chained views, which supports the exploration of

multidimensional network data, while keeping provenance information to enable further

study of users’ reasoning based on their interactions with the system. The visual

exploration process in MGExplorer consists of two phases, described as follows:

1. the overview phase, which consists of visualizing the network deﬁned by the SPARQL

query results through a node-link diagram (see description below). This visualization

allows the user to get an overall understanding of the clusters within the data; and

2. the exploratory phase, where the user can further explore items of interest by

selecting them directly on the visualizations, which subsets the data to be explored

via a new suitable visualization technique.

The generic aspect of MGExplorer enables the combination of multiple

visualizations to support (1) the comparison of two or more diﬀerent subsets of data

through a particular perspective provided by a particular visualization, and (2) the

comparison of diﬀerent perspectives of the same subset of data using multiple,

complementary visualization techniques. Particularly, we currently support data

exploration through six views summarized in Table 1 and described as follows:

• The node-link diagram shows a set of nodes, which represent data items (e.g.,

authors), and their relationships represented through line segments connecting them.

In MGExplorer, this visualization technique provide an overview of the relationships

within items of the input data. In our use case scenarios (Section 5), the relationships

are deﬁned by scientiﬁc publications, either to reveal co-authorship networks or

co-occurrence of named entities.

• The ClusterVis technique (Cava et al., 2017) enables the inspection of clusters and

data attributes (e.g., publication type) within the subset of items (e.g., authors or

named entities). The visualization has a multi-ring layout, where the innermost ring

is formed by dots representing data items, and the remaining rings display the data

attributes, which can be customized and reordered by the user. The items in the

innermost ring that belong to the same sub-cluster are connected via curved lines,

which one can highlight by hovering over the items. The remaining rings are formed

by bars where height and color encode diﬀerent data attributes (e.g., the height

encodes count and the color encodes the types of publications of a speciﬁc author).

• The IRIS technique represents the pairwise relationships between an item of interest

(e.g., an author) and the remaining items in a particular subset of data, which

relationship is described by data attributes (e.g., publication count and type) (Cava

et al., 2014). This technique is inspired by the eye’s iris, which can only focus on a

certain amount of information at the time, i.e., what is visible within our ﬁeld of

view. The selected item is represented in the IRIS as a circle at the center of the

view, surrounded by its related items, which are displayed in a way that the ones in

the ﬁeld of view (gray area) are larger than the ones outside this zone, easing

information extraction. The user can place any item in the ﬁeld of view by clicking

on it, switching the focus of the IRIS. In order to represent data attributes describing

those pairwise relationships, we use the height and color of a bar placed in between

the item of interest and each of its related items.

• The GlyphMatrix technique (Cava & Freitas, 2013) features a matrix where rows

and columns represent data items (e.g., authors or named entities), and the

intersection cell between each pair of items contains a glyph encoding the data

attributes describing that relationship. The default glyph is based on a radar chart,

where each axis displays the count of a diﬀerent data attribute (e.g., publication

type). The technique supports sorting of rows and columns to facilitate information

extraction, and hovering over cell to make the glyph larger and more visible through

a tooltip feature. This visualization technique could be seen as a combo of the

ClusterVis and IRIS by displaying the relationship between an item of interest and

other items in a pairwise manner, as well as the relationships within the remaining

items in the group.

• The Bar chart technique shows the distribution of publications according to a given

variable. In our case study, the x-axis encodes temporal information, while the y-axis

encodes the counting of publications. The data is displayed as a single bar per

time-period or multiple colored bars to represent categorical information of attributes.

• The Listing technique lists the items that form the relationship between two or more

nodes in the graph. In our case study, it displays the list of publications co-authored

by two or more authors or the publications where two or more named entities

COVID-ON-THE-WEB

21

co-occur, according to subset of data being explored. Each item of the list contains a

link to a descriptive web page of the publication, where the user can obtain more

information about it. Furthermore, if enabled by the GSS, each item contains a

context menu to enable further exploration using an external service (e.g., ACTA).

Each view is a self-contained element, which includes a visualization technique and

supports subsetting operations, enabling further exploration of subsets of data through

diﬀerent views. The views can be dragged, allowing the user to rearrange the visualization

space in meaningful ways to the ongoing analysis. They are connected via line segments,

which reveal their dependencies and enable tracing back the exploration path, thus

preserving provenance information.

Upon submitting a SPARQL query in the query management interface, the data

goes through a transformation process, and MGExplorer self-starts with the overview

phase. The node-link diagram and a History panel (Figure 6-C) are visible during the

whole exploration. The history panel displays the exploration path in a hierarchical format

to indicate the dependencies between views, and supports quick recover of the multiple

analytical paths that emerge from a particular view. The history panel allows the user to

clean the visualization space while focusing on what is relevant to the ongoing analysis by

5 Use Case Scenarios

In this section we illustrate the usage of COVID LDViz to explore the

Covid-on-the-Web dataset. The goal is to demonstrate what kind of data one can explore

using this interface and how the data processing between the query management and the

visualization interfaces support a multi-perspective exploration of the dataset.

5.1 Scenario 1. Clusters Visualization

Based on the premise that COVID-19 has increased the collaboration between

researchers from diverse disciplines around the world (Naujokaityt˙e, 2021), a biomedical

researcher from INCa was interested on searching for information about existing

collaborations on the theme of the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer (or more

generally between COVID-19 and other diseases) in order to analyze the nature of these

collaborations, their impact and their evolution. In this scenario, we illustrate how LDViz

could assist this analysis by exploring co-authorship networks.

We use a subset of data describing the co-authorship network within publications

related to coronavirus families retrieved with the query presented in Listing 1, which

resulted in 4,238 RDF triples corresponding to publications having the word “coronavirus”

in the title. These results were then transformed into a graph with 879 nodes (authors)

and 4,053 edges (connections between authors). Figure 7 depicts the exploratory path that

we follow during this scenario, which illustrates how one can explore clusters of co-authors

and related information to their co-publications. As mentioned earlier, the MGExplorer

visualization interface self-starts with an overview of co-authorship clusters through the

node-link diagram and the history tree of the exploratory process, which is progressively

completed based on the user’s interactions.

In the node-link diagram, we identify a dense sub-graph related to the author Yuen,

Kwok-Yung (Figure 7a), who will be our author of interest for this exploration. We hover

over the node representing the author, where we observe that they have 47 co-authors,

with whom ﬁve scholarly articles have been published. Subsequently, we right-click on the

node to activate a context menu that allows subsetting the data and explore it with

another visualization technique. We choose the ClusterViz view, where we can explore the

diﬀerent clusters within the subset of co-authors selected in the node-link (Figure 7c). For

two diﬀerent clusters, we subset the data by hovering over a particular author and display

the list of publications which they co-authored together (Figure 7d-e). Finally, we could

compare the contributions made within those clusters and the complete list of publications

co-authored by our author of interest (Figure 7f), to understand the impact of these

co-authorship relationships in terms of number and quality of publications they have

The generic structure of LDViz allows the construction of graphs with diﬀerent

topologies. The user can choose the variables that correspond to the nodes and the

connection between them (e.g., in the previous scenario, nodes correspond to a variable

that describes the authors’ names and the edges correspond to a variable that describe the

documents they co-authored). Together with biomedical researchers, we have identiﬁed the

task “to identify the articles that mention both a type of cancer and a virus of the corona

family” as being relevant for their analyses. Thus, in this scenario, we illustrate how we

can use the LDViz to solve this domain-related task. Using the query presented in

Listing 3, we retrieve the RDF triples that correspond to the pattern ?s → ?p → ?o, where

?s and ?o are, respectively, named entities related to (i.e., equal to, subclass of, or instance

of) “cancer” and “coronavirus” named entities, and ?p refers to the publications that

contain these named entities on their text body. The relationships are determined by

publications, however, unlike the Scenario 1, this query modiﬁes the topology of the graph

to represent the relationships between named entities instead of co-authors.

Listing 3: SPARQL query used in Use Case Scenarios 2 and 5 to retrieve the co-occurrence

network within publications of named entities related to cancer and coronavirus.

Figure 8 depicts the exploratory path followed in this scenario to solve the

above-described domain-related task. We explore a dataset that contains 452 RDF triples,

which results in a graph with 94 nodes and 169 edges. Since in this dataset, we deal with

two types of nodes, i.e., either related to “cancer” or “coronavirus”, we use the GSS feature

(see Listing 2) to color these diﬀerent types of nodes accordingly (i.e., green encodes cancer

and orange encodes coronavirus), easing the visual identiﬁcation of the relationship

between the cancer- and coronavirus-related nodes directly in the node-link diagram

(Figure 8a). Due to the nature of the data, we can easily spot a large sub-graph originating

from the SARS-CoV-2 named entity, which is associated to 62 types of cancer through 232

publications. We further explore the subset of data within this sub-graph by clicking-right

on the node representing SARS-CoV-2 and choosing the IRIS visualization, which displays

the relationships of this named entity with the diﬀerent types of cancer in a pairwise

manner (Figure 8b). We could observe via the longest bar in the IRIS that SARS-CoV-2

mostly co-occurs with “cancer” in 41 publications (Figure 8c), which types are not

speciﬁed. Further, we observe that the second most recurrent co-occurrence of

SARS-CoV-2 is with “head and neck cancer”, for which we observe the existence of 23

publications (Figure 8d). The Listing view displays the publications together with links to

their descriptive pages in the Covid-on-the-Web dataset, where the user can have more

The previous exploration scenarios allow the user to see the relationship between

co-authors or named entities, which can be characterized by the number of related

publications. Thus, this scenario illustrates how we can use the LDViz to explore custom

data attributes of a co-authorship network within coronavirus-related publications. In

particular, we will use a dataset that describes publications through the research topic

retrieved with the query presented in Listing 4. In the context of the Covid-on-the-Web

dataset, this information originate from the schema:about property, which refers to a set

of named entities that can be used to describe the research topic of the publication. The

resulting dataset has 1,265 RDF triples, which were transformed in a graph with 356 nodes

(authors) and 1,262 edges (co-publications). From the resulting data, the system identiﬁed

the values “sequence alignment”, “reverse transcriptase”, and “transfection” as the most

relevant research topics to describe the publications within the data and classiﬁed the

remaining under the “other” category.

Figure 9 depicts the exploratory path of this scenario. We inspect the clusters of

co-authorship within the associations of diﬀerent authors through the ClusterViz

visualization. We can observe, for instance, that the researcher Collisson, Ellen (Figure 9a)

has publications about diﬀerent topics (i.e., sequence alignment and other) within diﬀerent

clusters of co-authorship, while the publications co-authored by Chu, Chen-Chung

(Figure 9b) refer to the “other” category of topics and are distributed throughout diﬀerent

clusters of co-authorship. Finally, we observe that the publication co-authored by

Bocheneck, Gregor (Figure 9c), for instance, refers to the topic of “reverse transcriptase”.

5.4 Scenario 4. Exploring the Temporal Aspect of Relationships

Studying the evolution over time of co-authors relationships or named entities

co-occurrence could help understand when a collaboration between authors were stronger

or when certain research topics were of higher interest, which information could be further

explained with context, e.g., nowadays the research around the coronavirus topic is

stronger than ever due to the COVID-19 pandemics. Thus, in this scenario, we illustrate

how one can use the LDViz interface to explore the temporal aspects of relationships,

particularly co-authorship within publications related to coronaviruses (see Listing 1).

Figure 10 depicts the exploratory path used in this scenario. Similar to Scenario 1,

we use the node-link diagram to identify the author with the most co-authors, i.e., Yuen,

Kwok-Yung (hereafter called author A) with 47 co-authors associated through ﬁve

publications (Figure 10a). We further explore the relationship between author A and their

co-authors through the GlyphMatrix visualization, which shows the types and number of

co-publications between author A and every other co-author, as well as the co-publications

among author A’s co-authors. By ordering rows and columns by the number of

co-publications, we can observe in the GlyphMatrix, that author A’s most recurrent

co-author is Lau, Susanna (herafter called author B) (Figure 10b), with whom they have 4

publications. Thus, to verify when these collaborations happened, we explore the temporal

distribution of co-publications between those authors by subsetting the data in the

GlyphMatrix visualization and exploring it on the Histogram technique (Figure 10c). We

observe that they had collaborations in 2015 and 2016. When comparing to the totality of

co-publications related to author A (Figure 10d), we observe that four out of ﬁve

publications are co-authored by author B which could indicate a strong collaboration

between those authors in co-publications related to the coronavirus topic. We can also

observe that this collaboration appear to have ended ﬁve years ago, since the dataset

contains publications from 2015 to 2021.

5.5 Scenario 5. Exploring Argumentation Graphs with the ACTA Interface

As mentioned earlier, the GSS feature allows the user to include external services in

LDViz, such as a service that enable a further exploration of the resources currently being

visualized with the LDViz interface. In this scenario, we explore the subset of data used in

Scenario 2 (i.e., set of publications where named entities related to “cancer” and

“coronavirus” co-occur) to illustrate how one can use the ACTA interface to visualize the

The exploratory path of Scenario 5. In the LDViz interface we (a) ﬁnd a node of interest,

and (b) explore its related publications through the Papers List view. We right-click on a

document and explore it using the ACTA interface, where we can (c) visualize the

argumentative graph and (d) explore where the claims, evidence and PICO elements appear

in the document’s abstract.

argumentative graph of a certain publication identiﬁed during the exploratory process. As

one can see in Listing 2, the GSS form associate to the query contains an object called

“services” that provides the redirection information for the ACTA interface (i.e., a call to

“http://134.59.134.234:8081/analyseddocs?search=”). The documents used in the

Covid-on-the-Web dataset often originate from the PubMed archive23, where each

document has an unique identiﬁer. Thus, upon the selection of a document, the LDViz

system launches the ACTA service by redirecting the user to the given URL, while

providing the document identiﬁer as parameter.

Figure 11 depicts the exploratory path used in Scenario 5. As for Scenario 2, we

identify the larger sub-graph in the node-link diagram, which is the one connecting to the

node that corresponds to the named entity “SARS-Cov-2” (Figure 11a). Using the

Histogram, we display the 232 publications where this named entity occurs (Figure 11b).

Subsequently, we can choose any of the listed publications for which we would like to

visualize the argumentative graph using ACTA. We right-click on the publication of

interest and choose the “ACTA” option on the context menu that appears. This action

redirects the user to the ACTA interface, which retrieves the selected document from the

PubMed server, analyzes it, and display the resulting argumentative graph with the

relationships between claims and evidences, and PICO elements (Figure 11c). One can also

inspect these elements using the textual information (Figure 11d), where we can choose to

highlight the argumentative sentences or the PICO elements. Alternatively, one can query

the CORD19-AKG24 dataset to explore claims and evidences graph related to one or more

publications directly on LDViz by using a SPARQL query where ?s and ?o correspond to

claims and evidences, while the ?p variable correspond to the publication(s) where they

were identiﬁed.

6 Discussion

The Covid-on-the-Web project integrates knowledge from diverse research areas

(i.e., semantic web, NLP, and visualization) to assist researchers, particularly in the

biomedical ﬁeld, to explore the COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature. For this purpose, we created

a linked data version of the CORD-19 dataset and enriched it via entity linking and

argument mining. To the best of our knowledge, the Covid-on-the-Web dataset is the ﬁrst

public knowledge graph on the Web integrating publication metadata, named entities,

arguments and PICO elements into a single, coherent whole. The openness aspect of our

dataset and code should enable contributors to advance the current state of knowledge on

this disease. Further, we believe the Covid-on-the-Web dataset could serve as a foundation

for Semantic Web applications and benchmarking algorithms.

Moreover, we proposed a set of visualization interfaces to assist the exploration of

the Covid-on-the-Web dataset from diﬀerent perspectives, enabling the resolution of

various domain-related questions. In this paper, we have particularly focused on the LDViz

visualization tool, which supports the visual exploration of subsets of data deﬁned by

SPARQL queries. The tool is based on the MGExplorer visualization framework, which

proposes a collection of charts linked together through a chained visualization approach

that allows us to keep track of the exploration path, assisting the understanding of the

sensemaking process. This visualization aims to help users understand the relationships

within the results, e.g., users can run a query to visualize a co-authorship network; then

use IRIS and ClusterVis to understand who is working together and on which research

topics. An interesting aspect of our approach is that one can change the graph topology to

explore relationships between diﬀerent kinds of items. For instance, the user could execute

a query that looks for papers mentioning the COVID-19 and diverse types of cancer, as

illustrated in the Use Case Scenario 2 (see Subsection 5.2). Another strong aspect of

LDViz relies on the possibility of exploring the relationships within any subset of data

originating from any SPARQL endpoint thanks to the data transformation engine that

adapts the query’s results to the data format required by the visualization.

Additionally to our partners from Inserm and INCa institutes, the resources and

services proposed in the Covid-on-the-Web project have aroused the interest of other

institutions such as Antibes and Nice Hospital. Particularly, we have shown in this paper

that our approach supports the diﬀerent types of analyses evoked by domain users: the

analysis of clinical trials to make evidence-based decisions, which we support via

argumentative graphs; the study of the relationship between coronaviruses and other

diseases, such as cancer, which we provide through co-occurrence networks that assist their

search for scientiﬁc articles on the topic; and the identiﬁcation of researchers, institutions,

or countries working on the topic via co-authorship network analysis.

Although a ﬁrst level of evaluation is shown by translating the user queries to

SPARQL queries to visual data in LDViz, which shows that our dataset and visualization

services support the resolution of users queries, user evaluations are essential to validate

the usability and utility of a visualization. However, evaluating LDViz (as well as any

visualization) is not a trivial task since it has been designed to support exploratory tasks,

which are the hardest ones to replicate in an experiment (Ellis & Dix, 2006). Furthermore,

the value of LDViz can only be assessed when used by professionals on the application

domain (e.g., biomedical researchers), who are diﬃcult to recruit since they are not

necessarily available to take part in experiments. Future work includes implementing

user-based evaluations to investigate the usability of LDViz tool for exploring linked

datasets in general, and in particular its suitability for analyzing the COVID-19 scientiﬁc

literature and assisting the resolution of domain-related tasks.

The generic aspects of our tools allow us to later on apply the resources to a wider

set of use case scenarios, which possibility have been evoked by our biomedical partners,

who would like to perform similar analyses over issues other than the COVID-19. In fact,

the LDViz interface has been applied to two other publication datasets (i.e., HAL open

archive25 and the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph26, for which a set of predeﬁned

queries are available at http://covid19.i3s.unice.fr:8080/hal). The genericity of our

approach enables the exploration of data from any SPARQL endpoint, such as DBpedia27,

from which we explored the ontology and RDF Schema information, as well as a

co-starring relationship using movies information28. The tool also has a generic service that

enables the querying and visualization of any SPARQL endpoint, which URL can embed a

SPARQL query and the URL of a SPARQL endpoint29, to directly visualize the resulting

data. Furthermore, from a linked data perspective, one can use the Corese SPARQL

service30 to combine data from diﬀerent SPARQL endpoints using federated queries.

Typically, in an exploratory visualization, the user has no deﬁned goal and is

looking for no particular outcome (Leng, 2011). Although, in the context of the LDViz, the

user does have an initial query and would, therefore, have an exploratory goal in mind,

throughout the exploratory process one can make new discoveries that might not be

directly related to the initial query but that could be equally interesting. The user could

yet be interested in exploring the same data through diﬀerent visualization techniques,

which could provide them with a diﬀerent perspective to the data and would create an

alternative exploratory path to solve the same query. In this context, since visualization

can help to recall, revisit, and reproduce the sensemaking process through visual

representations of provenance data, MGExplorer visually represent the dependencies

between views through line segments and uses the history panel to display exploratory

actions hierarchically, keeping parenting and visualization information such as data and

technique used. The interactive aspect of the history panel allows the user to trace back

their exploratory path, while allowing them to start an alternative exploratory path from a

given point in history. Future work includes implementing a querying support for

alternative datasets through a mechanism of follow-up queries, which allows users to

launch a new query based on an item or subset of items of interest identiﬁed in a view,

bringing together complementary data from external datasets to enrich the analysis.

A strong aspect of the LDViz interface, and in particular, the MGExplorer

visualization tool, is the ability to record and visualize provenance information. Currently,

this information is restricted to the subsets of data and the visualizations used during the

analysis. Thus, we also intend to increase the variety of provenance information we record,

considering the several interactions used during the exploration (e.g., clicks, hovering, data

sorting, etc) that might be relevant to understanding users’ reasoning, as well as to include

a feature that allows users to make annotations throughout the process regarding the

historic items. Future work also includes the analysis of the resulting provenance data. For

instance, we could analyze the resulting data to identify the most common usages of the

system (standard choices of visualizations and instantiating order) according to diﬀerent

types of tasks, which could be used to introduce the system to new users, suggest some

well-known workﬂows of analysis, and to improve overall user experience. Furthermore, we

could validate these usage patterns through user-based evaluations involving experts in the

application domain, who would evaluate whether and at which level the common detected

workﬂows respond to their needs and how it could be improved, i.e., which alternative

exploratory path one would follow to solve speciﬁc user queries.

For the purpose of extending the range of resources and services of the

Covid-on-the-Web project and, thus, extend and improve the supported types of analyses,

future work includes integrating new visualization services, such as ARViz (Menin,

Cadorel, et al., 2021), which allows the visual exploration of association rules describing

patterns of co-occurring names entities within publications through three complementary

visualization techniques: a scatter plot, a chord diagram and an association graph31. The

tool currently works separately with a pre-treated subset of data extracted from the

Covid-on-the-Web dataset. However, the association mining algorithm can process any

RDF dataset, which results could be then explored with ARViz. Thus, future work

includes the integration of this visualization interface in the LDViz tool, where the user

could analyze and explore meaningful data deﬁned via SPARQL queries, similarly to what

is done with the MGExplorer, resulting on a completely integrated tool for extracting and

exploring knowledge from scientiﬁc literature through various perspectives.

In this paper, we presented the dataset and software resources provided by the

Covid-on-the-Web project, with particular focus on the visualization services proposed to

support the exploration of the COVID-19 scientiﬁc literature. Based on the needs of

biomedical researchers, partners of the project, we designed and published a linked data

knowledge graph describing the named entities mentioned in the articles of the CORD-19

corpus and the argumentative graphs they include. The knowledge graph generation

pipeline has been published to allow the scientiﬁc community to reuse, enrich and adapt

both the dataset and the pipeline in meaningful ways to assist users needs.

Furthermore, we described and demonstrated the usage of LDViz, a visualization

interface dedicated to the exploration of linked data, which is based on a SPARQL

querying interface and the MGExplorer interface, a generic visualization framework

designed to explore multidimensional graph data. We have shown the potential of this

interface to explore diﬀerent perspectives to the Covid-on-the-Web dataset, supporting the

resolution of diverse domain-related tasks.

Future works include evaluating our resources and services with participation of

expert users in the biomedical domain in terms of usability and suitability to solve the

domain-related tasks; developing of a querying feature that allows to dynamically import

data into the exploratory process from external datasets, aiming to enrich the ongoing

analysis and explore on-the-ﬂy hypotheses; studying provenance information aiming on

improving user experience and the visualization’s eﬀectiveness; and integrating new

visualization services to extend the support for diﬀerent domain-related tasks.
