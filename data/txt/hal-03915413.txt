Abstract 

Keywords: conductance, model, root hydraulics, root system architecture, solute transport, xylem, 
water deficit, water transport. 

Root water uptake is driven by a combination of hydrostatic and osmotic forces. Water transport 
was characterized in primary roots of maize seedlings grown hydroponically under standard and 
water deficit (WD) conditions, as induced by addition of 150 g.L-1 polyethylene glycol-8000 (water 
potential= -0.336MPa). Flow measurements were performed by the pressure chamber technique in 
intact roots or on progressively cut root system architectures (RSA). To account for the concomitant 
transport of water and solutes in roots under WD, we developed within realistic RSAs a Hydraulic 
Tree Model integrating both solute pumping and leak. This model explains the high spontaneous sap 
exudation of roots grown in standard conditions, the non-linearity of pressure-to flow relationships, 
and negative fluxes observed under WD conditions at low external hydrostatic pressure. The model 
also reveals the heterogeneity of driving forces and elementary radial flows throughout RSA, and 
how this heterogeneity depends on both plant treatment and water transport mode. The full set of 
flow measurement data obtained in individual roots grown under standard or WD conditions was 
used in an inverse modeling approach to determine their respective radial and axial hydraulic 
conductivities. This approach allows to resolve dramatic effects of WD on these two components.

Introduction 

The uptake of soil water by roots is crucial for the growth and survival of most of terrestrial plants. 
Root water uptake allows the plant to maintain its water status, under favorable or adverse 
environmental conditions such as drought, by continuously balancing transpirational water losses 
and supplying water required for expansion growth (Steudle, 2000a). Root water uptake sequentially 
involves a radial transport of water from the soil to the root stele and its axial transport along the 
root vasculature. Radial transport is mediated through cell wall (apoplastic) and cell-to-cell 
(symplastic or transcellular) pathways running across peripheral cell layers (epidermis, cortex, 
endodermis) down to the xylem. Transcellular water transport is mediated in large part by aquaporin 
(AQP) water channels (Maurel et al., 2015). Axial transport consists of conveying sap flow along 
xylem vessels, throughout the whole root system architecture (RAS), up to the aerial parts 
(Gambetta et al., 2017). The conductance of the radial and axial pathways can be altered in response 
to multiple environmental cues, providing a continuous adjustment of root hydraulics to water 
availability and demand (Aroca et al., 2011; Boursiac et al., 2022b). In particular, water deprivation 
can lead to rapid changes in AQP activity (Hachez et al., 2012;). These effects which depend on 
drought intensity can result, depending on genetic background, in a monotonous inhibition of root 
hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) or in bell-shaped dose-response curves (Rosales et al., 2019). On the 
longer term, WD can also alter xylem development with contrasting effects depending on species 
(Ramachandran et al., 2020). Finally, WD enhances suberization of both exo- and endodermis, 
possibly altering solute transport (Doblas et al., 2017).

properties of plant roots, using a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling 
approaches on excised segments or whole root systems (Boursiac et al., 2022a; Heymans et al., 
2021; Meunier et al., 2018; Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016). Most recent works rely on hydraulic 
models imbedded within RSA, based on the Hydraulic Tree Model of Doussan et al. (Boursiac et al., 
2022a; Doussan et al., 1998a; Doussan et al., 1998b; Meunier et al., 2017; Zarebanadkouki et al., 
2016), or on approaches that combine a hydraulic cross-sectional model at cellular level with 
anatomical observations along the root (Couvreur et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020; Heymans et al., 
2021). 

for decades. The first models were based on a representation of the root as an osmometer. The 
whole root system was reduced to one, two or even three membranes separating homogeneous 
compartments (Fiscus, 1975, 1977, 1986; Miller, 1985b; Murphy, 2000; Steudle, 1994). Some more 
recent models provide a longitudinal, bi-dimensional representation of unbranched root structures 
considering the role and transport selectivity of Casparian strips and suberin lamellae (Foster and 
Miklavcic, 2016, 2017). Complementary to these, (Couvreur et al., 2018) proposed a 2D cross-
sectional model computing water transport at subcellular levels (walls, membranes, and 
plasmodesmata) and considering apoplastic solute diffusion and symplastic homeostasis.  

More integrative root models that couple water and solute transport have also been existing 

In recent years, efforts have been made to assess the radial and axial water transport 

Hydraulic models at RSA level are designed to account for the non-uniformity of hydraulic 
parameters like axial conductance. Therefore, they can efficiently simulate the heterogeneity, over 
the whole root system, of radial and axial hydraulic flows and of water potential components (e.g. 
hydrostatic pressure in the xylem). However, none of these models has been able to simulate whole

root water transport under WD conditions, when osmotic driving forces become predominant. 
Current root osmometer models can do so but, conversely, cannot represent the heterogeneous 
aspects of a RSA since the root is modeled as a restricted number of compartments in which solute 
concentration is homogeneous and pressure is uniform. Interestingly, these models have been able 
to mimic to a certain extent some experimental and puzzling observations like the non-linear 
relation between sap flow and pressure (Steudle, 1994). Integrating water and solute transport 
models within RSA could therefore provide a means to account for all the pre-cited aspects and, 
ultimately, investigate the multiple effects of WD on root water and solute transport parameters. 

Materials and Methods 

Boursiac et al. recently proposed an inverse modeling approach, based on pressure chamber 

To fill this gap and describe the concomitant transport of water and solutes in roots under 

WD, we coupled within realistic RSAs of maize seedlings a hydraulic model to a solute transport 
model of Fiscus’ type (Fiscus, 1977). Cut-and-flow data and pressure-to flow relationships (Jv(P)) 
were used in an inverse modeling approach to determine the radial and axial hydraulic 
conductivities of primary roots grown under standard or WD conditions. This approach allows to 
resolve dramatic effects of WD on both radial and axial conductivities. 

measurements in excised roots, to simultaneously assess axial conductance and radial conductivity 
of complex branched root structures (Boursiac et al., 2022a). This approach, called cut-and-flow, 
consists in measuring exuding sap flow rate, at a constant working pressure, in a root system that is 
successively cut from its distal part. A Hydraulic Tree Model named HydroRoot (DOI: 
10.5281/zenodo.6584200) was inverted to fit the cut-and-flow data, thereby allowing a 
determination of the axial conductance profile and radial conductivity on the same root system. 
Because it exclusively considers hydrostatic driving forces, this model cannot operate in roots under 
WD or when osmotic forces are predominant.

Seeds of a maize B73-UH007 hybrid (B73H) (Millet et al., 2016) were surface-sterilized in 50 ml of 
1.4% bleach with a drop (~ 50 µL) of Tween-20 for 15 min under gentle agitation. The seeds were 
then treated with 35% H2O2 for 2 min, rinsed with 70% ethanol, and washed 6 times with sterilized 
water. The seeds were overlaid with wet clay beads in a plastic box, which was itself covered by a 
transparent plastic film. Seeds were germinated in the dark and further grown in a growth chamber 
at 65% relative humidity, with 22°C/20°C and 15 h/9 h light/dark cycles (150 µE.m-2.s-1). 

At five days after sawing (DAS), seedlings were transferred to a hydroponic container filled with 24 L 
of a medium containing 1.25mM KNO3, 0.75mM MgSO4, 1.5mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.5mM KH2PO4, 0.1mM 
MgCl2, 0.05mM Fe-EDTA, 0.05mM H3BO3, 0.012mM MnSO4, 0.7mM CuSO4, 0.001mM ZnSO4, 24.10-5 
mM MoO4Na2, 1.10-5 mM CoCl2, 0.1mM Na2SiO3, and 1mM MES. Plants were grown in this solution 
for two days. At seven DAS, seedlings were transferred for four additional days to a fresh medium 
containing 150 g/L of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) to reduce the water 
potential of the nutrient solution. The control plants were transferred for four days in a fresh 
hydroponic solution. The water potential of the control hydroponic solution (-0.034 MPa) was 
measured with a WESCOR 5520 vapor pressure, with a resolution of 1 mmol/kg (2.5 10-3 MPa at 293 
°K). Addition of 150 g/L PEG to the control solution leads to a final water potential of - MPa,

according to the empiric law used to determine the water potential of PEG solution (see below the 
paragraph Viscosity and water potential of a PEG solution). 

Overall, two bathing solutions were used for plant growth and pressure chamber experiments: the 
control (CTR) hydroponic solution and the hydroponic solution containing 150 g/L PEG (PEG). This 
resulted in three plant sets:  

Measurements of pressure-dependent xylem sap flow [Jv(P)] 

(i) eight CTR plants, grown in a CTR hydroponic solution, with measurements done in the same 
solution (ii) eight PEG plants grown in a PEG hydroponic solution, with measurements done in the 
same solution (iii) five PEG-CTR plants grown in a PEG hydroponic solution, and transferred into a 
CTR solution for one hour prior to water transport measurements in the same CTR solution.  

Root water flow was measured on de-topped primary roots using a set of pressure chambers with 
automated recording as described in (Boursiac et al., 2022a). The primary root was carefully excised 
below the grain, placed into an adapter sealed with dental paste (Coltene Whaledent, France) and 
threaded across the silicone seal of the pressure chamber lid. The root was then placed into the 
pressure chamber in a container filled with either a CTR or PEG hydroponic solution. The adapter 
was connected to a flowmeter (Bronkhorst, France) in order to record the flow of sap (Jv) from the 
root system at successive pressures (P) applied on the bathing solution using nitrogen gas. Typical 
successive relative pressure steps were, in MPa: 0.00, 0.05, 0.15, 0.10, 0.25, 0.20, 0.35, 0.30, 0.45, 
0.50, 0.25, 0.00. (0.00 represents the atmospheric pressure). Some experimental data sets comprise 
fewer pressure steps, down to 4 including exudation at atmospheric pressure. Only 4 plants over 21 
had less than 6 steps.

Cut-and-flow measurements were performed just after Jv(P) measurements. The operating pressure 
was set constant over the whole experiment: 0.3 MPa with PEG solution and 0.2 MPa with CTR 
solution (unless for two plants done at 0.3 MPa as well). In brief, and along the lines of our previous 
work (Boursiac et al., 2022a), Jv was first recorded in the intact root system at the operating 
pressure. The root was taken out of the chamber and placed in a petri dish filled with their bathing 
solution. The lateral roots were stretched and aligned along the primary root and the whole root 
system was cut with a razor blade at a given distance to the tip, typically a few centimeters. Leaving 
the cut root segments in the petri dish, the remaining part of the root system was placed back into 
the chamber at the operating pressure and the Jv was recorded. This procedure was repeated 
successively.

To be as fast as possible during the cutting process (average cutting time was 140 ± 8 s), the cut

remaining root system was 5.2 ± 0.6 cm. 

Digitizing of root architectures 

Water and solute transport model 

The root segments released after each cut and the basal root system remaining after the last cut 
were scanned at 600 dpi. The root parts were then digitized using SmartRoot (Lobet et al., 2011), an 
ImageJ plugin, the segment lengths and the lateral position on their parent root were exported as 
text file in csv format. The complete root system was then reconstructed by recognizing, at each cut, 
the segments belonging to the primary root and the ones belonging to the laterals, and by pasting 
them to the remaining system. For example, considering an experiment with n successive cuts, the 
segments from the last cut were pasted to the remaining basal root system. Then the segments from 
the previous cut (n-1) were pasted to this new basal root system, and so on. Note that we did not 
scan the intact root system to avoid any damage before measurements. 

The diameters of the primary root and its laterals were entered into the model for building the 
representation of the RSA (see Water and solute transport model). They were determined from 
three independent panels of CTR and PEG plants. Each experiment had six to ten plants of each type, 
yielding a final count of 23 CTR and 28 PEG plants. The roots were scanned, and the diameters were 
estimated using ImageJ. The average primary root diameters were 1.05 mm (n=104) and 1.03 mm 
(n=133) for CTR and PEG plants, respectively, with standard errors in the range of 2 10-3 mm. The 
average lateral root diameters were 0.36 mm (n=1345) and 0.39 mm (n=1495) for CTR and PEG 
plants, respectively, with standard errors below 2 10-4 mm. The 11-day-old roots had only first order 
laterals.

The present model is a modification of the HydroRoot RSA hydraulic model (Boursiac et al., 2022a). 
HydroRoot was developed as a component of the OpenAlea platform (Pradal et al., 2008). It uses a 
Multiscale Tree Graph (MTG) (Godin and Caraglio, 1998) to represent a root hydraulic architecture, 
which consists of the topology of a root system (branching positions, root lengths, root radii, etc.) 
and its hydraulic structure (local radial and axial conductivities). With respect to (Boursiac et al., 
2022a), the main modification of HydroRoot was the addition of solute transport equations to the 
hydraulic model. This change led to a major difference in the resolution of the equation system on 
the whole RSA. Thus, the hydraulic architecture can no longer be modeled by an analogous electrical 
network (Boursiac et al., 2022a) and the coupled solute and water transport equations had to be 
solved in a matrix form. 

The model was developed at millimetric scale, the order of magnitude of the primary root diameter. 
The RSA was discretized in cylindrical elementary volumes (Figure 1), considered as representative 
elementary volumes (REV). The REV diameter, d, is equal to the root diameter, and depends on the 
root order (primary or first laterals). The REV length,  , is of the order of the diameter, here 1 mm, 
which was small enough to get numerical convergence. The local transport equations described 
below were considered in each REV. Each REV can be seen as two concentric media: the peripheral 
tissues (from epidermis to pericycle) through which radial transport happens, and a central medium 
(stele with xylem vessels) where the sap flows axially. In the following, the parameter units are 
displayed within brackets and correspond to the international system of units.

Water transport 

The hydraulic model is the same as in HydroRoot, with the addition of a radial water flow rate due to 
osmotic potential difference. Thus, the radial water flux can be modeled as follows:

     and      the PEG contribution to the osmotic pressure of the bathing solution and 

where j is the local radial water flow rate, k (m.s-1.MPa-1) the radial hydraulic conductivity.    , 
      and     (MPa) correspond to the hydrostatic water potential difference between the bathing 
solution and the xylem sap, to the osmotic water potential difference due to the PEG and to the 
osmotic water potential difference due to the solutes, respectively. σ is the effective reflection 
coefficient. S (         ) is the external surface area of the REV (m²). Expressing the water 
potentials, equation (1) can be written as follows: 

where Pe and P are the hydrostatic pressure of the bathing solution and within the xylem vessels, 
respectively,     
inside the xylem vessels, respectively, Ce and C the solute concentration in the bathing solution and 
in the xylem vessels (mol.m-3),respectively, R the gas constant, T the temperature (set to 298°K 
     and      are calculated according to PEG concentration (Supplementary Fig. S1A). 
here). Both     
Since PEG 8000 is a non-permeant solute, its contribution to the osmotic pressure inside the xylem 
(    ) is only considered in cut-and-flow experiments within PEG bathing solutions.

where J is the axial sap flow rate, K(μ) the axial conductance that depends on sap viscosity (m4.s-
1.MPa-1; see below), ΔP the local pressure difference between two REVs,   the length of the REV. The 
axial conductance is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity μ, as illustrated for example by the 
conductance in a cylindrical capillary of radius r:  ( )       (  ). The sap is commonly considered 
having water viscosity. Thus, axial conductances were displayed as corresponding to a sap viscosity 
of 1 mPa.s (equation (3)) and not independently of the viscosity, as follows:     (   ) (    ) .The 
former expression is commonly used in the literature (Doussan et al., 1998a; Doussan et al., 1998b; 
Heymans et al., 2021; Landsberg and Fowkes, 1978; Meunier et al., 2018; Zarebanadkouki et al., 
2016) and allows better comparisons. Note, however, that when PEG penetrates the root 
vasculature in cut-and-flow experiments, the viscosity significantly increases with the PEG 
concentration (see next paragraph) and has to be taken into account. 

The axial sap flow rate was modeled with a Hagen-Poiseuille’s law type:  

     ( )

To reduce the number of parameters to be adjusted (see Parameter determination), σ was set to 
0.85, a value reported for nutrients on maize root systems (Miller, 1985a). Sensitivity tests were 
done to evaluate the impact of σ on the other parameters (see Results and Discussion).

Solute transport

     [  

      (      )]  

The modeling of solute transport is based on two experimental observations: exudation at 
atmospheric pressure and negative sap flow observed in some PEG roots. Under atmospheric 
pressure monitoring, sap flow is driven by the osmotic pressure gradient due to the solute 
concentration difference between the outer solution and xylem sap (see equation (2)). Pure 
hydraulic models, without any solute transport to the xylem vessels, cannot explain such behavior in 
steady state. To account for a constant positive exudation rate, the solutes exiting the root by 
exudation must indeed be balanced by an uptake of solutes. Thus, in addition to the water radial

flux, we hypothesized a constant active uptake rate of solutes, noted Js
Yet, the steady and negative sap flow rate observed in some PEG roots raises specific questions. If 
sap continuously flows from the root base to the bathing solution, whereas solutes driven by Js
entering the root at a constant rate, the solute concentration in xylem vessels should increase 
indefinitely, in contradiction with the mass balance principle that should be verified in any REV of 
the root. Therefore, an additional solute flux, or leakage, from the xylem vessels to root bathing 
solution, was modeled as a passive diffusion characterized by the tissue permeability Ps. The radial 
solute flux was therefore expressed as follows: 

A ccepted M anuscript

Since solutes are transported along xylem vessels by advection, axial solute flux can be expressed as 
        (mol.s-1). When PEG penetrates the root in cut-and-flow experiments, its axial flux has the 
same form:              (mol.s-1) where Cpeg is the PEG concentration in the xylem vessels. Details 
about the discretization of the equations and their resolution on the matrix form of the RSA can be 
found in Supplementary Protocol S1. 

The overall coupled model of solute and water transport within a RSA is summarized in Figure 1. The 
subfigure C sketches a case where the hydrostatic pressure of the bathing solution is greater than 
the atmospheric pressure at the basal part of the root, and the outer concentration of solutes is 
lower than the sap one. Added to the radial water flux, the two solute transport components (Js
are also represented. 

where js (mol.s-1) is the radial solute flux, Js
is the radial permeability of the root peripheral tissues. As in equation (2), C and Ce correspond to 
the solute concentration in the xylem vessels and in the bathing solution, respectively. S is the 
external surface area of the REV. 

Viscosity and water potential of a PEG solution 
The water potential of a PEG solution,     , does not follow the Van’t Hoff’s law but can be 
described, at a given temperature, by an empirical polynomial law (see equation 1 in (Michel, 1983) 
and Supplementary Fig. S1 A). The osmotic pressure of PEG solution can be expressed as       
     . For a PEG concentration of 150 g/L, Ψpeg = -0.302 MPa.

200 g/L, with a data point (1 mPa.s) added at wpeg=0 to integrate the viscosity of pure water. Note 
that a PEG solution at 150 g/L exhibits a viscosity of 14 mPa.s while water viscosity is 1 mPa.s.

positioned at around 0.1 m depending on the abscissa of the cut-and-flow data. 

(ii) a radial conductivity equal to 10-7 m.MPa-1.s-1. This arbitrary value is consistent with literature

perform these minimizations. Local optimization routines were used because global optimizations, 
such as dual annealing, were often unable to get a correct fit. Due to the heterogeneity of the plants 
and condition panel, an identical numerical workflow was sometimes not possible. Thus, we used 
different optimization routines, running several times the optimization process. The main workflow

Results 

Jv(P) and cut-and-flow experiments in roots under control and WD conditions 

Focusing on functional responses of maize primary roots to WD, the pressure chamber technique 
was used to measure the flow-to-pressure relationship [Jv(P)] and obtain cut-and-flow data in de-
topped roots. WD was induced by addition of PEG-8000 (150 g/L), lowering the water potential of 
the bathing solution to -0.336 MPa. Three different sets of growth and experimental conditions were 
used. Control (CTR) plants were grown in a standard hydroponic solution and de-topped roots were 
studied in the same solution. PEG plants were exposed to WD for 5 d with water transport 
measurements done in the same PEG bathing solution. PEG-CTR roots were derived from plants 
grown in a PEG solution and transferred into a control solution for one hour prior to pressure 
chamber measurements in a control solution. Besides methodological considerations, the latter 
treatment allows to explore the reversibility of WD effects on root water transport parameters.  

Figure 2 shows six examples of Jv(P) relationships measured in the three series of roots. PEG 
roots (Figure 2 C and D) showed non-linear curves, a properties observed in six out of eight plants. In 
contrast, Jv(P) curves of the two other root types (CTR or PEG-CTR) were more linear. Yet, two of 
these roots (Figure 2 A and F) showed a weak non-linearity below 0.1 MPa. Another key property 
emphasized by Figure 2 D is the possible occurrence of negative xylem flow rates for positive 
hydrostatic pressure differences, up to 0.2 MPa. This is also shown in Figure 3, which displays xylem 
flow rates at atmospheric pressure [J0=Jv(0)], i.e. without any external hydrostatic driving force. 
These flow rates are very stable over time and could be measured in some roots for up to one hour. 
For the eight PEG roots, the average J0 was -2.5 ± 0.9 10-3
control hydroponic solution yielded positive J0 values (CTR: J0 = 2.1 ± 0.8 10-2 L.s-1; PEG-CTR: J0 = 
1.4 ± 0.6 10-2 L.s-1) (Figure 3).

corresponding cut-and-flow experiments performed after Jv(P) measurements (Figure 2). In brief, 
Figure 4 shows increases in pressure-induced flow rate upon progressive cuts of the root system 
from root tips to base. The curves determined in CTR roots are characterized by a low initial slope 
that increases with length of the cut root (Figure 4 A and B). The four other curves, derived from PEG 
and PEG-CTR roots, show a less convex shape, with higher slopes from the first cut. Thus, the cut-
and-flow curves catch the impact on root functional properties of plant growth under WD. 

The same conclusions can be drawn from Jv(P) and cut-and-flow data obtained in a total of

Based on the experimental data documented above, we developed a RSA model of water and solute 
transport allowing to fit the Jv(P) and cut-and-flow data of roots exposed to control or WD conditions 
(Figures 2 and 4; Supplemental Figures 2, 3 and 4). Indeed, a pure water transport model could not 
explain exudation at atmospheric pressure or negative fluxes observed in some PEG roots. Basically, 
an osmotic term was added to the radial water flux (equation 1 and 2) and solute transport was 
coupled to hydraulic flow. Using the model within realistic RSA allowed to map the heterogeneity of 
solute and water flows throughout the root. Figure 5 shows representative CTR (Figure 5A-C) and 
PEG (Figure 5D-F) roots bathing in a CTR or PEG solution, respectively, under a same hydrostatic

overpressure of 0.1 MPa. Note that, as indicated below, the hydraulic and solute transport 
parameters were determined by fitting Jv(P) and cut and flow data (Figure 2A and 2C; Figure 4A and 
4C). For each root, the figure depicts the heat map of the hydrostatic and osmotic driving 
components (see equation (2)),             and            , and the resulting local radial water 
fluxes. The CTR root shows an increasing ΔP from the tips to the base with a negative difference at 
the primary tip that would drive a radial efflux of water (Figure 5 A). Yet, influxes occur throughout 
the RSA (Figure 5C), indicating that the dominating force driving water influx in the primary tip is    
(Figure 5 B). In addition, a progressive drop in xylem solute concentration is observed along the RSA, 
due to dilution effects by the sap flow. Thus, the progressive increase in radial flows along the RSA 
can be explained by a dominating effects of variations in ΔP over variations in ΔC (Figure 5 C). 
Although the PEG root is bathing in a medium with a low osmotic potential (-0.336 MPa), it presents 
the same trends as the CTR root, with water influxes throughout the RSA, a progressive increase of 
ΔP from the tips to the base and, inversely, a progressive drop of ΔC (Figure 5 D-F). Whereas radial 
water influx varies in parallel to    variation, as in the CTR root, the absolute value of ΔP remains in 
the range of 0.1 MPa which is insufficient to counter balance the external water potential of -0.336 
MPa. Therefore, both    and    serve as joint driving forces. Finally, we note that, although the 
PEG root harbors gradient properties throughout its architecture, these variations are of very low 
amplitude (< 1%), much lower than in the CTR root (                    (MPa);            
     (Mol.m-3)). Therefore, the PEG root has much more homogeneous properties inside the xylem 
vessels than the CTR root.

but under spontaneous exudation condition. A water influx can be observed throughout the RSA 
(Figure 6C). Yet, a negative ΔP can be observed over the whole architecture, with an increasing value 
to the base (Figure 6A). Such ΔP, which counteracts radial water inflow, is due to the induction of a 
sap flow in the xylem. As discussed above, the ΔC decrease to the tips results from dilution effects 
due to water flow (Figure 6B). Therefore, the major driving force for radial influx is ΔC, and its 
variation along the RSA is concomitantly controlled by ΔP and ΔC. 

The present approach was further used to obtain a comprehensive view, using model inversion, of 
the water and solute transport properties of real roots, obtained from CTR or PEG plants, and 
measured in CTR or PEG solutions. Here again, parameter adjustments were done concomitantly on 
the Jv(P) and cut-and-flow data, taking into account penetration of PEG in xylem vessels during cut-
and-flow experiments. One set of parameters was therefore obtained for each of 21 roots 
investigated. Best fits of these experiments are shown in Figure 2, Figure 4 and Supplemental Figures 
2, 3 and 4. We note that, for all roots investigated, the goodness of fit (R²) for the relationship 
between the measures and values simulated from the fitted model was higher than 0.91 
(Supplementary Fig. S5). 

integration throughout a RSA of discretized elementary modules leads to heterogeneity in driving 
forces and elementary flows, depending both on root type and water transport mode.

Smoothing (lowess) of CTR (n=8), PEG (n=8) and PEG-CTR (n=5) data sets. The K profiles of roots 
grown in the presence of PEG, whatever the Jv(P) measuring solution (PEG or CTR), are very close to 
each other. Since measurements in PEG-CTR roots were performed one hour after their transfer into 
a CTR solution, we assume that their xylem anatomy (and therefore their K profile) was similar to 
that of PEG roots. Thus, these results indicate that the bathing solution used during the cut-and-flow 
experiment, and in particular the presence or absence of PEG, does not interfere with the 
determination of K. As a consequence, our approach reveals, with respect to CTR roots, a dramatic 
increase of K in root tips grown under WD.

Determination of radial hydraulic conductivity and solute transport parameters 

Figure 8 shows the distribution of the three radial transport parameters giving the best fits. With 
respect to CTR roots, PEG roots showed a tenfold decrease in mean radial hydraulic conductivity (k). 
This result is in accordance with the decrease in hydraulic conductivity commonly observed in roots 
under WD (Steudle, 2000b), such as in Arabidopsis grown in a 150 g/L PEG solution (Rosales et al., 
2019). PEG-CTR roots showed k values similar to those of CTR roots pointing to a quick reversal of 
the WD-induced inhibition of k. The solute transport parameters (Js
interpret with respect to known effects of WD. This difficulty was reflected by the fact that the CTR 
and PEG-CTR data were very scattered.

To possibly understand the scattering of Js
adjusted k to the two solute transport parameters. In the following, we note k0, Js0
parameter values giving the best fit. The test was run for the CTR and PEG roots corresponding to 
* 
panels A and C of Figure 2, respectively. It consisted in adjusting k on Jv(P) for various values of Js
* and Ps variations for a 10% change of k around k0. For the CTR 
and Ps and to look at the range of Js
root, a ±10 % variation of the adjusted k was obtained for Js varying from 5 10-4 to 4 times Js0 and for 
Ps varying from 5 10-4 to 131 times Ps0. The objective function (F) was almost multiplied by 10, 
varying from its minimum 2.6 10-4 to 2.2 10-3. In the PEG root, a ±10 % change of the adjusted k was 
obtained for Js varying from 4 10-4 to 2.05 times Js0 and for Ps varying from 1 10-3 to 4.0 times Ps0 with 
F varying by two orders of magnitude from its minimums. Thus, in either type of roots, the 
determination of radial hydraulic conductivity k shows low sensitivity to the active uptake rate and 
the passive permeability of solutes. 

In the present model, the reflection coefficient (σ) was initially set to 0.85, a value previously 
reported for nutrients in maize root systems (Miller, 1985a). In order to evaluate the impact of σ on 
determination of other parameters, we performed two sets of adjustment, with two contrasting 
values, σ = 1 and σ = 0.5, respectively. With respect to axial conductance profiles determined with σ 
= 0.85, the maximum discrepancy was obtained for CTR roots and σ = 1, with an average change of K 
of 1.2%. In all the other cases, K variations were lower than 1%. Determination of k was also largely 
insensitive to σ with a maximum change of mean k below 3% (Supplementary Fig. S6 A and D). For

can be determined using the present inverse modeling approach. 

Discussion 

In the present work, we developed a model of root hydraulic architecture aimed at describing the 
behavior of maize primary roots under control or WD conditions. Besides radial and axial water 
transport, that were represented using a fairly classical Hydraulic Tree Model, solute transport was 
also considered throughout RSA, using both an active uptake rate and a tissue permeability 
coefficient. As in our earlier work (Boursiac et al., 2022a), our main aim was to develop an inverse 
modeling approach to assess the radial conductivity and the axial conductance profile of a branched 
root system. Yet, this procedure was improved as it relied not only on sap flow data obtained in cut-
and-flow experiments but also on extensive Jv(P) data obtained in intact roots. Most importantly, 
this procedure was validated in plants grown under standard conditions or PEG-induced WD. We 
showed that the solute transport must be considered to explain sap exudation at atmospheric 
pressure, when the driving force is essentially osmotic. Solute transport also allows to fit the specific 
features of the Jv(P) data of some plants under WD with a non-linear relationship and negative sap 
fluxes. The experiments performed in different conditions demonstrated the robustness of the 
method to determine concomitantly the radial and axial water transport parameters on real RSA. 
Most importantly, they allowed us to obtain a comprehensive view of combined effects of WD on 
radial and axial hydraulic conductances. 

A ccepted M anuscript

The Jv(P) data reported in the present work showed two key properties: negative sap flow rates 
specific to PEG roots, and a non-linearity that was particularly accentuated in PEG roots. A non-
linearity of sap flow according to applied pressure has already been described in maize (Gorska et 
al., 2008; Miller, 1985b) or other plant species (Fiscus, 1986; Jackson et al., 1996; Markhart and Smit, 
1990; Rüdinger et al., 1994). For instance, Miller (Miller, 1985b) reported Jv(P) curves that were 
linear for positive relative pressures but showed a non-linear shape at negative relative pressures. 
Gorska et al. (Gorska et al., 2008) observed that the Jv(P) relationship can be considered as linear 
only for pressure above 0.1 MPa. These reports are in accordance with our measurements in roots 
bathing in a CTR solution, whatever the plant growth conditions (CTR or PEG). For roots grown and 
maintained under WD, we found the non-linearity to be further accentuated. This can be explained 
by the dramatically reduced radial conductivity of these roots (Figure 8 A). Since the non-linearity of 
Jv(P) results from the changing balance between hydrostatic and osmotic driving forces, the reduced 
radial conductivity shifts to higher positive pressures the range at which the hydrostatic forces 
become preponderant and Jv(P) linear. 

The Jv(P) curve shape 

Yet, the non-linearity of Jv(P) cannot be modeled without considering solute transport. An absence 
of solute fluxes would imply that the osmotic pressure term in equation (2) is uniform over the RSA, 
leading to a linear relation. In fact, when Jv(P) is monitored at high flow rates, this function can 
reasonably be adjusted with a linear fit. The slope can then be interpreted as the root hydraulic 
conductance, which yields the root hydraulic conductivity. In addition, the intercept with the 
pressure axis, P0, is usually assumed to be the pressure needed to counter balance the osmotic 
pressure of the bathing solution (Passioura, 1988). To explore this further, we tried to determine K

Development of a water/solute model at RSA level  

and k using such a purely hydraulic model, i.e. exclusively based on equations (2) and (3). In equation 
(2), the osmotic pressure term was set constant and equal to P0 and therefore equation (2) was 
expressed as      (      ) , with P being the relative pressure. The fits were done on the linear 
part of Jv(P) and on the cut-and-flow experiment. In CTR roots, k was found to be reduced by 9 % 
with respect to the value obtained with the water-solute transport model. The errors on K axial 
conductance profile were higher, up to 37 %. In PEG roots, the differences between the two model 
settings were higher, the averaged k being reduced by 21 % and K by up to 84 % when the osmotic 
pressure term was set to P0. Thus, a simplified osmotic model which does not take solute transport 
into account results in significant variations in hydraulic parameter estimations. Supplementary Fig. 
S7 shows best fits of the experiments with a purely hydraulic model, and a constant osmotic 
pressure P0. While the quality of fit with CTR roots is good (R² = 0.95), this type of model is unable to 
fit the PEG data at low pressure when the osmotic term is preponderant (R² < 0.83). 

Models that couple water and solute transport have been existing for decades, but they usually 
represent the whole root as a simplified osmometer with two or three compartments (Fiscus, 1975, 
1977, 1986; Miller, 1985b; Steudle, 1994, 2000a). In these models, the root interior (i.e. the inner 
volume of the xylem vessels) is supposed to have a homogeneous solute concentration and 
hydrostatic pressure. Consequently, the water and solutes fluxes are uniform all over the root 
surface. This is, however, not the case in real root systems, where sap flow through axial resistances 
results in a hydrostatic pressure gradient along xylem vessels. This pressure gradient leads to a non-
uniform pressure difference between the outer solution and the xylem vessels, that increases from 
the root tips (laterals and primary) to the basal ends (Figure 5 A and D; Figure 6A). The radial flow of 
water shows the same trend along the RSA (Figure 5 C and F; Figure 6C). Consequently, the sap flow 
rate increases towards the root base leading to a progressive decrease of the solute concentration 
(Figure 5 B and E, Figure 6B). In osmometer models, this dilution along the RSA is typically neglected. 
Consequently, these models overestimate the solute concentration inside the xylem compartment, 
leading to an overestimation of the flow rate. Indeed,      (      ) decreases with increasing 
(overestimated) C, and as consequence      (         ) increases in these conditions.

equations (2) and (4), for a root represented according to Fiscus (Fiscus, 1975, 1977) as a simple 
semipermeable barrier separating two compartments (see Supplementary Protocol S2). The 
comparisons of the adjusted transport parameters between the RSA model and the two-
compartment model show marked differences for CTR and PEG-CTR roots (Supplementary Fig. S8). 
In particular, the radial conductivity k is significantly underestimated in the two-compartment 
model, by 65 % for CTR roots and 45 % for PEG-CTR roots. In contrast, the solute parameters, Js
Ps, increase dramatically, by 77 and 78 %, respectively, for CTR roots, and by 84 and 88 %, 
respectively, for PEG-CTR roots. The water and solute transport parameters were noticeably less 
affected in PEG roots, with changes between 10 and 18 %. This is due to more homogeneous 
concentration profiles inside these roots because of lower fluxes. For instance, the difference in 
solute concentration, calculated from the basal end to the tip of the primary root, and divided by its 
length, was 92.7 ± 29.6, 2.3 ± 0.7 and 12.5 ± 3.0 mol.m-4, for the CTR, PEG and PEG-CTR roots, 
respectively. 

To illustrate this point, we calculated an analytical solution of the present model, based on

Robustness  of  the  cut-and-flow  method  to  estimate  axial  conductance  in  roots 

under water deficit 

As discussed above, the coupling of solute and water transport in the present root model prevented 
from significant errors in hydraulic parameter determination. In addition, the model had to 
represent the possible inflow of PEG in the root vasculature during cut-and-flow experiments. Effects 
of PEG on both radial osmotic potential differences and sap viscosity had to be modeled throughout 
RSA. 

Whereas our results are in line with studies in numerous species showing WD-induced 

To assess these additional modeling constraints, we closely inspected the physiological consistency 
of data obtained in plants exposed to WD. In brief, both PEG-CTR and PEG plants were submitted to 
WD during their growth. Yet, the roots of the former plants were exposed to a CTR hydroponic 
solution for one hour prior to water transport experiments. By contrasts, roots of the latter plants 
were maintained in a PEG bathing solution during measurements. The axial conductance profiles K 
of the two series of roots were notably similar. In contrast, and in comparison to PEG roots, the 
radial conductivity of PEG-CTR roots was reversed to CTR root values. We believe this to be 
coherent, since K is linked to the xylem vessels that are fixed structures and probably cannot be 
altered significantly within one hour in a CTR solution. In contrast, k is related to aquaporin activity 
that can be reversed within this time lapse.

inhibition of aquaporin activity (Maurel et al., 2015; Rosales et al., 2019), they are at variance with 
the lack of effects of a PEG-induced WD on maize Lpr, as reported by Hachez et al. (2012). Future 
work will be required to determine to which extent differences in experimental conditions can 
account for this discrepancy. The precise description of effects of WD on axial conductance also 
represents a significant advance which will have to be related to effects of drought on root growth 
and/or xylem differentiation (Ramachandran et al., 2020). Note that the consistency of axial 
conductance determination would have not been achieved without considering in detail the 
viscosity of PEG-containing sap. To illustrate this, let us consider the Hagen-Poiseuille’s law which 
predicts that the conductance of a pipe is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity. Thus, the axial 
conductance of a pipe filled with a PEG solution at 150 g/L is 14 times lower than that of the same 
pipe filled with water (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Indeed, we checked that interpreting the cut-and-
flow experiments done in a PEG bathing solution with a sap viscosity of 1 mPa.s leads to an 
underestimation of K by about an order of magnitude.  

In agreement with the idea that the maize root is permeable to solutes, we set σ to 0.85 in the 
present root functional model, a value reported in the literature for complete root systems bathing 
in a nutrient solution (i.e. the nature of the solutes is unknown and nutrients account for all solutes 
present in solution) (Miller, 1985a). Yet, we note that in few other works presenting reflection 
coefficient values for nutrients (non-differentiated solutes), σ was referenced close to unity (Fiscus, 
1986; Knipfer et al., 2021; Knipfer and Fricke, 2010). Nevertheless, we further tested the sensitivity 
of our model inversion method by performing parameter adjustments for σ = 1.0 and 0.5, 0.5 being 
the lower bound reported for solutes like sucrose in maize primary roots (Steudle, 2000a). Our 
results show that hydraulic parameters were essentially insensitive to σ, and that the two solute

parameters were not strongly impacted (Supplementary Fig. S6). These considerations further 
support the robustness of the model inversion method. 

Conclusion 

In the present work, we have extended the toolbox developed by (Boursiac et al., 2022a), combining 
experiment and modeling to assess the water and solute transport parameters of maize root 
systems under WD. The experimental data consisted of two successive measurement sets done with 
a pressure chamber: Jv(P) determination, followed by a cut-and-flow experiment. A critical step was 
to formalize solute transport to account for the specific shape of the Jv(P) curve of plants under WD. 
Furthermore, maize roots grown under WD were investigated under varying measurements 
conditions, thereby assessing the robustness of our inverse modeling approach. Thus, this novel 
procedure allows a concomitant determination of water and solute transport parameters and of 
their alteration upon exposure to WD. In brief, plants grown under WD exhibited, with respect to 
plants grown under standard conditions, a notable enhancement of axial conductance (K) in root 
tips. Conversely, the radial conductivity k was reduced tenfold upon direct exposure of roots to WD. 
Further studies will have to address more complex RSAs considering, for instance, specific hydraulic 
and solute transport properties in lateral roots and a non-uniform radial conductivity along the root 
axis. To do so, it may be useful to integrate in the present inverse modeling approach other 
experimental parameters such as solute concentration in the exuded sap. Finally, our approach can 
be extended to testing the effects of other environmental factors, such as hypoxia, on water and 
solute transport in roots.

Figure 1: Modeling water and solute transport within realistic RSAs of maize primary roots. (A) RSA 
of a CTR root with a heat map representation of the solute concentration. Scale bar: 10 mm. (B) The 
architecture was discretized in representative elementary volumes (REV). (C) Sketch of the different 
fluxes in and out of a REV, for                and         and in the absence of PEG. The sap flow 
along the xylem vessels is characterized by the axial conductance K profile. The water flow across the 
peripheral root tissues and into the xylem is characterized by the radial hydraulic conductivity k. The 
*. Ps is the tissue permeability of the 
solutes are taken up into the xylem vessels at a constant rate Js
solutes. (D) REV geometry characterized by its length l and its diameter d that depends on the root 
order (axial or first order lateral root). 

Figure 4: Representative examples of cut-and-flow data in individual primary roots. The data are 
derived from the same roots as in Figure 2. (A, B) CTR roots. (C, D) PEG roots. (E, F) PEG-CTR roots. 
Dots represent experimental data, whereas solid lines indicate the best fit obtained with the model. 

Figure 2: Representative examples of Jv(P) curves in individual primary roots. (A, B) CTR roots. (C, D) 
PEG roots. (E, F) PEG-CTR roots. Dots represent experimental data, whereas solid curves indicate the 
best fit obtained with the model. 

Figure  3:  Flow of xylem sap exuded from excised roots  at atmospheric pressure. CTR  (black): n=8; 
PEG (green): n=8; PEG-CTR (orange): n=5. Each box indicates the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the 
line inside indicates the median value, and the T bars mark the 5th and 95th percentiles.  

Figure 5: Heat maps of driving components and radial water flux throughout the RSA of a CTR root 
(A, B and C), and a PEG root (D, E and F) bathing in a CTR or PEG solution, respectively. In both cases, 
a  hydrostatic  overpressure  of  0.1  MPa  was  applied  to  the  external  medium.               is  the 
difference  between  the  hydrostatic  pressure  of  the  external  medium,  Pe,  and  the  xylem  vessel 
pressure  P,  in MPa  (A  and  D).               is  the  difference  between  solute  concentration  in  the 
xylem vessels, C, and the external concentration, Ce, in mol.m-3 (B and E). j is the local radial flow of 
water in µL.s-1.m-2 (D and F). Scale bar: 10 mm.

Figure  8:  Values  of  radial  hydraulic  conductivity  (A),  active  solute  uptake  rate  (B)  and  solute 
permeability (C) determined by inverse modeling in the indicated root types. Each box indicates the 
25th and 75th percentiles, while the line inside indicates the median value, and the T bars mark the 5th 
and 95th percentiles. Corresponding individual values are shown with the same color on the left of 
each box plot. 

Figure  7:  Variations  of  axial  conductance  (K)  as  a  function  of  distance  to  root  tip.  The  solid  lines 
represent lowess fits done on K profiles of CTR roots (black; n = 8), PEG roots (green; n = 8), and PEG-
CTR roots (orange; n=5). The dashed lines delineate the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 

Figure 6: Heat maps of driving components and radial flux throughout the RSA of a CTR root in a CTR 
solution and in conditions of spontaneous exudation (the bathing solution was at equilibrium with 
atmospheric pressure). Same notations and conventions as in Figure 5. Scale bar: 10 mm.
