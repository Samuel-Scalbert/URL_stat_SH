R´esum´e

The taxonomic identiﬁcation of charcoal is an inherent step in any anthracological analy-
sis, but it can be challenging in some parts of the world with rich woody species. A combina-
tion of several anatomical criteria, or features, is necessary to describe a charcoal specimen.
Regions with rich woody species are characterised by a high level of similar anatomical char-
acteristics that often limit wood identiﬁcation at the family / tribe level, especially when
archaeological charcoals are not well preserved, or very fragmented.
In the southern African interior plateau in central Limpopo, the richness of the native woody
plants is estimated to include around 1000 ligneous species. The diverse climatic regimes
and landforms that characterize the region also contribute to the high inter - and intra-
speciﬁc variability in wood anatomy, intrinsically linked to the physiological conditions of
tree growth. However, there is currently no comprehensive atlas or identiﬁcation key for the
study area that takes into account both the wide diversity of woody species and their anatom-
ical variability. Compilation in a single database of anatomical descriptions from wood of
the study area is thus needed to allow rigorous taxonomic identiﬁcation while facilitating
the work of bibliographic research. These descriptions, which include more than hundred
anatomical characters per specimen, are regularly updated and adjusted according to the
International Association of Wood Anatomists (IAWA). They currently include specimen
descriptions (with duplicates) from: ﬁeld sampling (83), the InsideWood online database
(ca. 1800), the CIRAD xylotheque in Montpellier (23), the Goethe University xylotheque
(40), and various published articles (ca. 400).

1567 micrographs from ﬁeld-sampled specimens were acquired according to the three anatom-
ical sections of wood under the reﬂected light microscope as well as the scanning electron
microscope (SEM). They were uploaded to the online database Anatom-IA, a collaborative
and interoperable image bank dedicated to wood anatomy research and training. In addi-
tion, approximately 700 micrographs were acquired in the diﬀerent xylotheques visited and
approximately 1000 micrographs are currently extracted from the literature.
We present here the database of anatomical features in connection with the bank of micro-
graphs, which are under construction. These data are intended to be published as a digital
identiﬁcation key for southern African woods. Throughout these databases, we will discussed
