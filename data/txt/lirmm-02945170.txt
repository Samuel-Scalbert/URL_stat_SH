Thirthy Ontologies from the OBO World

Abstract. The more ontologies are produced, the more need to identify mappings
between them becomes important. Several practices and tools have been devel-
oped to support ontology alignment, but still, it remains a challenge. In the OBO
world, ontology developers use cross reference annotations (formally using the
oboInOwl:hasDbXRef property) to link a term to an external entity, including an-
other term in another ontology (i.e., a mapping). These XRefs contains informa-
tion of high value, because they were manually declared/veriﬁed by domain experts
when the ontology was built. However, extracting and exploiting them remains a
challenge for users due to their heterogeneous and chaotic descriptions. In this pa-
per, we report on analysis of approximately 1 million XRefs in 30 ontologies from
the OBO world. Our results show that 10.7% of these XRefs are ontology map-
pings, but conﬁrm that semantically-ambiguous usage of the cross-reference prop-
erty which make it impractical or even impossible to reuse. We describe and quan-
tify several issues identiﬁed (e.g., different kind of XRefs, miscellaneous format-
ting, ambiguous targets), and discuss some way to mitigate them especially by us-
ing more relevant speciﬁc properties taken from standard semantic Web metadata
vocabularies.

Keywords. OBO Foundry, OBO ontologies, biological and biomedical ontologies,

1. Introduction

Semantic interoperability in biological and biomedical applications has been inﬂuenced
by the use of ontologies. Many domain-speciﬁc ontologies are developed by subject mat-
ter experts. Driven by several use cases in agronomy, we have designed AgroPortal, a
repository of ontologies and vocabularies for agronomy and related domains (agricul-
ture, plant science, food, and biodiversity – http://agroportal.lirmm.fr) [5,6]. As
of May 2020, AgroPortal includes 120 ontologies, thesaurus, and vocabularies encoded
in different formats. AgroPortal host 22 OBO Foundry ontologies [13] such as the Gene
Ontology, Protein Ontology, Plant Ontology, Environment Ontology, Agronomy Ontol-
ogy, or FoodOn Ontology. In addition, AgroPortal hosts ontologies not referenced in the
OBO Foundry but developed with the OBO format or methodology such as the Livestock
Product Trait Ontology and the Soy Ontology or some crop-speciﬁc trait dictionaries in
the Crop Ontology project. The more ontologies are added to AgroPortal, the more the
need to identify mappings between them becomes important. Today, we want to create
in AgroPortal a mapping repository to store and merge any kind of mappings between

the ontologies stored in the portal. Therefore, we have investigated methods to extract
mappings explicitly declared by developers inside the ontology source ﬁles [1].

The OBO Foundry [13] is an initiative to create a set of well-deﬁned reference on-
tologies and to enforce a set of design principles for ontologies to be orthogonal, inter-
operable and avoid unnecessary duplication of work. There exist several ways of iden-
tifying equivalent or similar terms from other ontologies. In the OBO world,1 ontology
developers employ a cross-reference mechanism (later abbreviated XRef) to link ontol-
ogy terms to external entities including terms in different ontologies. Formally, this is
done using the XRef property in the OBO format or the oboInOwl:hasDbXRef property
in OWL and referencing an external term with the prefix:id notation. This notation
combines a preﬁx and an id (e.g., GO:0005623. Indeed, each term has a unique iden-
tiﬁer that consists of a preﬁx (the ontology IDSpace) concatenated with the id for that
term within the ontology. Based on the OBO format speciﬁcation: “The IDSpace (...)
should ideally be registered on the GO xrefs page or with OBO”. This was supposed to
facilitate the identiﬁcation of terms throughout the whole OBO world. However, we have
identiﬁed an ambiguous and chaotic usage of the XRef mechanism by ontology devel-
opers which makes potentially very valuable information, impractical or even impossi-
ble to reuse. Chriss Mungall has stated in a blog post 2 that different representations of
mappings serve different purposes. He states that erroneous usage of XRefs can lead to
the propagation of erroneous information across multiple ontologies, which could have
bad consequences. For instance, in addition to external ontology terms, we found uses of
the XRef property to reference databases or elements inside databases, Web pages, cita-
tions, or even the curator of a term. We have found spelling mistakes, different preﬁxes
for the same term (e.g., NCBITAXON, NCBI ), and different ways to identify a term
(e.g., FMA:31396, FMA:Cartilage of inferior), including different way of using the
prefix:id notation (with / or

instead of :).3

To extract ontology mappings from XRefs, we had to disambiguate and curate these
misleading XRefs using a semi-automated methodology. We have developed the Ontol-
ogy Mapping Harvesting Tool (OMHT), a tool to extract mappings from inside ontology
source ﬁles and reify them into speciﬁc objects with metadata and provenance informa-
tion. OMHT can semi-automatically curate ambiguous IDs and preﬁxes existing in the
XRef properties. In this paper, we present an analysis of the use of XRefs in a corpus of
30 OBO and OWL ontologies related to the agri-food domain hosted in AgroPortal in
March 2020. We illustrate discrepancies found in the ways XRefs are used, we describe
and quantify several issues identiﬁed and discuss some way to mitigate them especially
by using more relevant speciﬁc properties taken from standard semantic Web metadata
vocabularies and unambiguous identiﬁers. The main contributions of this work are:

• An openly available tool (OMHT) to extract and disambiguate XRefs;
• An analysis of the use of 1 million XRefs across a subset of 30 ontologies;
• A curated dataset of 551,957 XRefs from ontology terms to other entities;
• Recommendations for substituting XRefs by better alternative representations

when the actual use of XRefs is semantically ambiguous.

1We use this expression to englobe the OBO Foundry and Library ontologies as well as ontologies designed

with the same practices or format but not formally declared in the Foundry (www.obofoundry.org).

3The OBO Foundry guidelines name this notation ”CURIE” (http://www.obofoundry.org/
id-policy.html), but we use here the expression prefix:id to include valid CURIES and alternative uses.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the next section presents related work.
In Section 3, we describe the methodology to retrieve and curate XRefs. In Section 4,
we present an analysis of the XRefs curated and non-curated. In Section 5, we discuss
the results and we give some recommendations. Finally, we conclude and present some
perspectives in Section 6.

2. Related work

Mappings ontologies are necessary when working with multiple ontologies. These map-
pings can be used for a variety of reasons, such as data integration, decision support, se-
mantic search, data annotation, and reasoning [3]. For instance, Mungall et al. 2016 [12]
makes extensive use of cross-reference mappings to build a uniﬁed representation of dis-
ease. Although the semantics of the XRef property is not explicitly deﬁned by the OBO
format we supposed that it has been frequently used to indicate equivalence/similarity
between terms [7]. The reference speciﬁcation (syntax and semantics) of the OBO for-
mat4 requires the target term to be declared using the prefix:id notation. All XRefs
should follow the OBO Foundry ID policy i.e., all ID-spaces must be registered and ap-
proved, and the entire ID should consist of the ID-space followed by ’:’ followed by a
zero-padded numeric local identiﬁer (a minimum of 7 digits is recommended). Plus, the
ontology header speciﬁes how to consider XRefs (e.g., treat-xrefs-as-equivalent,
treat-xrefs-as-is a). Nevertheless these guidelines, the document itself acknowl-
edged that XRefs frequently do not conform to the canonical prefixed:id pattern.

Challenges remain when integrating term identiﬁers from multiple sources due to a
lack of consistency in how identiﬁers are reported [11]. Plenty of work has been pub-
lished about the automatic generation of mappings between ontologies [3]. However, to
the best of our knowledge, ontology mappings analysis is quite rare. Mapping analysis
can lead to discover interesting insights related to the nature of the aligned ontologies and
the quality of mappings. In 2009, Amir et al. studied term overlap between biomedical
ontologies in the NCBO BioPortal [14] using LOOM, a lexical matching system to ﬁnd
terms with similar labels between ontologies [4]. In 2015, Kamdar et al. [9] investigated
term reuse and overlap in 377 ontologies from BioPortal [14]. More recently, Kamdar et
al. investigated term reuse and overlap in 509 ontologies from BioPortal. Kamdar et al.
concluded that despite best practices recommendations biomedical ontologies were still
far from achieving ideal term reuse, beyond the upper level and popular ontologies [10].
The only previous work we have identiﬁed on exploiting XRefs is the one done to
build the Ontology XRef Service (OxO) at the European Bioinformatics Institute [7].
Like us here, OxO is interested in extracting ontology mappings from XRefs in 104
ontologies. They harmonize the identiﬁers to provide an integrated resource of mappings
and build a nice visualization (www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo). To disambiguate the preﬁx
of XRefs’ target data sources, OxO automatically relies on Identiﬁers.org [8], the OBO
library, and preﬁxcommons.org. In their study, OxO identiﬁed 1.4 million XRefs, where
the preﬁxes are identiﬁed automatically. There remain around 80 identiﬁer preﬁxes that
are not automatically identiﬁed. OxO curates only mappings to ontologies and does not
deal with web pages or RDF datasets. In our work, we propose a similar semi-automatic
approach to identify preﬁxes to different kinds of targets including semantic resources

4https://owlcollab.github.io/oboformat/doc/GO.format.obo-1_4.html

and web pages; then we manually curate and complete the preﬁxes and the identiﬁer
patterns as described after.

To extract and curate mappings from ontologies (including XRefs), we have not
found any reusable tool except the oxo-loader which is limited for use with EBI Ontology
Lookup Service. Therefore, we have developed a more generic tool (OMHT) that deals
directly with an ontology source ﬁle accessed in AgroPortal or NCBO BioPortal.

3. Methodology: XRefs extraction and curation

In this section, we describe the methodology for extracting a dataset of XRefs from
ontologies stored in AgroPortal using a semi-automatic curation of the XRefs. Each XRef
references a source term (in the ontology processed by OMHT) and a target entity. Some
ontologies formally import other ontologies using the construct owl:imports; in these
cases, we did not process the imports of external ontologies nor include their XRefs in our
dataset. The XRefs extraction using OMHT mainly follows four steps (in the following
sections, we detail step 2 and 3):

1. Access ontologies RDF/XML serialization via AgroPortal REST API;
2. Identify XRefs in the ontologies looking up oboInOwl:hasDbXRef occurences;
3. Curate ambiguous XRefs using a manually built target curation ﬁle;
4. Store the ﬁnal curated XRefs as reiﬁed objects (using JSON format used for map-
pings in AgroPortal) and generate statistics about curated and non-curated XRefs.

OMHT parses the RDF/XML ﬁles of the ontologies to identify XRefs. Once an
XRef is identiﬁed locating the property oboInOwl:hasDbXRef, the script extracts the
source term URI from the current ontology, and tries to explicitly generate an URI for
the target ontology and target term (or in our case the target entity if not an ontology
term). The target term or entity can be identiﬁed based on the following patterns:

• A prefix:id pair: It is common to ﬁnd XRefs that describe the target term using
a prefix:id notation, with various separators (e.g., AGRO:4356 or GRO 000023
or CHEBI/0686857547). In these cases, the OMHT identiﬁes the preﬁx as the
target ontology identiﬁer and the id as the target term identiﬁer. By extension, in
this study the preﬁx was also considered as a database identiﬁer and the id as an
identiﬁer of an entity in this database.

• An URI or URL candidate: OMHT parses the string trying to identify patterns in
the target term or entity to extract the ontology/database and term/entity URIs. If
founded, the URIs are stored as this in the XRef extracted. Otherwise, the URIs
are saved for manual curation.

• Invalid target: If the script founds a string content in another format than the two
described above they are discarded. These invalid XRefs are stored in a curation
ﬁle to manually identify the proper target ontology/database and term/entity.

When an unambiguous ontology and ontology term cannot be directly identiﬁed as
target, OMHT relies on a curation ﬁle which groups invalid pair of prefix:id, invalid
URL/URI and non recognized targets and map them to a proper target. Being grouped
and sorted by the number of occurrences allow a curator to disambiguate targets by

batches. The ﬁle used for curation is publicly available with OMHT source code.5 Fig-
ure 1 depicts the semi-automatic curation process: OMHT searches for the target on-
tologies automatically using Web services from AgroPortal [6], BioPortal [14], OBO
Foundry [13], and Identiﬁers.org [8]. If the preﬁx of the target ontology is found, the in-
formation is stored in the curation ﬁle to facilitate/accelerate the curation work. If not, a
speciﬁc status informs that this need curation. Additional information for each target on-
tology is provided to facilitate the curation process, as the number of occurrences for that
target, the acronyms of the source ontologies where that target was founded, and syntax
example of targets. The external curation ﬁle is maintained by our research group and
uses iteratively by OMHT: once a target has been manually disambiguate once, future
executions of OMHT will consider the target extracted valid. Therefore, manual curation
help to replace invalid targets by valid URIs for ontology and ontology term. OMHT
has been primarily designed to extract ontology mappings, but in this study, we used it
to extract also annotations or cross-references to other entities contained in XRefs. The
curator (ﬁnal author) manually tagged each target with its type:

• Y: the target is a valid ontology (and a valid identiﬁer for the ontology is provided);
• RDF: the target is an RDF dataset (in which URIs can be used) but not an ontology;
• URL: the target is a valid reference to a database or database element accessible

by a URL.

Once the curation process is ﬁnished, we can generate statistics to get insights from

the usage of the extracted XRefs.

4. Results and examples

In this section, we present an analysis of the XRefs extracted from our corpus of on-
tologies using OMHT. We classify and quantify the number of curated XRefs based on
the type of target, that can refer either to ontology terms, RDF datasets, or Web pages.
Then, we analyze the non-curated XRefs. As of May 2020, AgroPortal hosts 122 se-
mantic resources related to agri-food, plant sciences, and ecology-biodiversity. We ex-
amined a set of 97 ontologies, which includes 88 ontologies in the OWL format (e.g.,
ENVO, GO, SO, PO) and 9 ontologies in the OBO format (e.g., TRIPHASE, Onto-
Biotope, Wheat Phenotype). Within these 97 ontologies, 30 contains XRefs (17 ontolo-
gies from the OBO library, 13 others). Using the OMHT tool, we identiﬁed 951,957
XRefs in the ontology source ﬁles. In Figure 2, we depict a nested pie chart that shows
the number of curated and non-curated XRefs as well as their repartition. The percentage
of curated XRefs is 58.3%, and there are 25 ontologies with at least one curated XRef.

In this corpus, we were not able to identify the target of 398,247 XRefs (after called
non-curated). The dataset of curated XRefs in openly available in the OntoPortal JSON
format at https://zenodo.org/record/3842750.

Figure 2. Number and repartition of curated and non-curated XRefs.

4.1. Curated XRefs analysis

With OMHT’s semi-automatic approach, we were able to identify a total of 553,710
curated XRefs, around 58% of the XRefs found. As illustrated in Figure 2, the majority
of the curated targets reference external RDF datasets (27,8%) and only 10,7% of the
XRefs are explicit mappings between ontology terms. This ﬁrst result is important as it
tells us two things: (i) XRefs are mainly not ontology mappings (89,3% are something
else) and (ii) 10,7% of XRefs as mappings between ontology terms is already a quite
signiﬁcant number of mappings that could be very useful for the community.

4.1.1. Curated XRefs to ontology terms

OMHT successfully extracted a total of 102,370 XRefs (10,7%) mappings to ontology
terms. We classify curated XRefs mappings to ontology terms as follows:

• Internal mapping: when the target ontology is actually also hosted in AgroPortal;
• Inter-portal mapping: when the target ontology is stored in another portal of the

OntoPortal family (mostly the NBCO BioPortal in our case);

• External mapping: when the target ontology is simply identiﬁed by its URI and

not a local identiﬁer in AgroPortal or BioPortal.

The majority of mappings to ontology terms (68,400 mappings in 26 ontologies) are
internal mappings. There are 9,417 inter-portal mappings and 24,553 external mappings.
This observation states the good interconnection between AgroPortal ontologies, and
was for us a proof of coherence of the domain covered. A large part of the mappings
(58,529) is between the NCBI Taxonomy and Gramene Taxonomy. The rest of the top-
aligned ontologies are described in Table 1. In the following, is an example of an XRef
found in the Plant Trait Ontology (TO) which captures a mapping to another term in the
Plant Ontology (PO):

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TO_0000017">

<oboInOwl:hasDbXRef rdf:datatype="xsd:string">PO:0025131
</oboInOwl:hasDbXref> </owl:Class>

The mapping extracted by OMHT, after the curation step, which disambiguates/validates

the PO preﬁx, represented in OntoPortal JSON format is:

{"creator":

"relation":
"source":
"comment":
"classes": {

"http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/user/mappingadmin",
["http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboinowl#hasdbxref"],
"http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/TO",
"Generated using OMHT v.1.3 - 07/04/2020 14:42 CEDT",
"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PO_0025131": "PO",
"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/TO_0000017": "TO"}}

In this representation, ontologies are identiﬁed by their acronyms in AgroPortal (a
locally unique identiﬁer), but it would be straightforward to use the URI of the ontologies
instead. In this example, and very often, identifying the target ontology was straightfor-
ward as XRefs formally uses OBO libraries deﬁned preﬁxes. Other examples required
some human investigation. In the following, are examples of miscellaneous ontology
targets found in the corpus:

• From GR-TAX, TO, EO and PECO ontologies, OMHT extracted 58,795 XRefs to
ncbi taxid. Manual curation resolved this preﬁx to the NCBI Taxonomy. How-
ever, CL and EO use another preﬁx ncbitaxon and Food ontology uses the full
URI: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ncbitaxon. This mix of preﬁxes
referencing the same ontology increased the complexity of the curation process.
• From Food ontology, OMHT extracted 9,368 XRefs to textttsubset siren. Man-
ual curation of this preﬁx resolved this preﬁx to the LANGUAL thesaurus. The
identiﬁcation of this preﬁx was signiﬁcantly longer.

4.1.2. Curated XRefs to RDF datasets

OMHT successfully extracted a total of 265,962 XRefs (27,8%) to RDF dataset elements
(i.e., an entity in an RDF dataset identiﬁed by a speciﬁc URI) like DBpedia or UniPro-
tKB. We count a total of 9 curated target RDF datasets. The top cross-referenced RDF
dataset is UniProtKB, with 221,462 cross-references from the Protein Ontology (PR).
We also found 33,639 cross-references from the same ontology to the OMA orthology
database. The rest of the most cross-referenced RDF datasets are described in Table 1. In

the following, is an example of an XRef found in PR which captures a cross-reference to
an entry in the UniProtKB dataset:

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_A0A0B4K7J2">

<oboInOwl:hasDbXref rdf:datatype="xsd:string"> UniProtKB:A0A0B4K7J2
</oboInOwl:hasDbXref> </owl:Class>

Identifying the target (http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/) was not straight-
forward and OMHT relied on Identiﬁers.org to automatically ﬁnd a candidate tar-
get which was then manually validated. The URI pattern had also to be validated
to be sure to non-ambiguously identify the right cross-referenced entity (in this case
http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/A0A0B4K7J2). After is a series of examples
of miscellaneous RDF dataset targets found in the corpus, often as the form of base
URI because in these cases the prefix:id notation was not much used: DBPedia
(http://dbpedia.org/resource/), Deutsche National Bibliothek (http://d-nb.
info/gnd/), UMTHES environmental thesaurus (http://data.uba.de/umt/).

4.1.3. Curated XRefs to Web pages

OMHT successfully extracted a total of 91,584 XRefs (9,58%) to Web pages (i.e., a Web
document identiﬁed by a speciﬁc URL) like a Wikipedia entry or an ISBN database entry.
We count a total of 20 curated Web site or database targets. The top cross-referenced Web
site is Reactome, with 13,130 Web links from PR. The rest of the most cross-referenced
web sites and databases are described in Table 1. For instance, we found 1,761 cross-
references from the Environment Ontology (ENVO) to Wikipedia pages:

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000020">

<oboInOwl:hasDbXref rdf:datatype="xsd:string">

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake

</oboInOwl:hasDbXref> </owl:Class>

For this example, there is no use of the prefix:id notation. The oboInOwl:hasDbXref

property directly contains the URL to the Web page. As another example, we identi-
ﬁed in the Gene Ontology (GO) 1,761 references to books identiﬁed with an ISBN. For
example:

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0000003">
<oboInOwl:hasDbXref rdf:datatype="xsd:string"> ISBN:0198506732
</oboInOwl:hasDbXref> </owl:Class>

In this example, there is no direct usage of the URL as illustrated in ENVO be-
fore. Here, the GO developers employed the XRef property to annotate terms with re-
lated books and extrapolated the prefix:id notation to reference the books. These
types of target had of course to be manually identiﬁed. When possible, the curator
also identiﬁed a possible speciﬁc Web page for the corresponding targeted element
and speciﬁed the pattern for OMHT to generate proper cross-reference URLs. In the
previous example, we were able to identify ISBNdb.com database and the speciﬁc
URL: https://isbndb.com/book/0198506732. A similar situation was found with
PubMed citations references, where the ‘pmid’ or ‘pubmed’ preﬁxes were used (28,735
Xrefs in 19 ontologies) and we transformed them to the proper URL in PubMed (e.g.,
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22654893).

4.1.4. Other curated XRefs

In complement, OMHT extracted a total of 93,794 other XRefs (9,82%) in 165 tar-
gets, which were not classiﬁed as ontology term, RDF datasets or Web pages. In these
targets, we surprisingly discovered 83,592 XRefs documenting the curators of ontolo-
gies terms (e.g., goc, poc) i.e., the person considered as the creator or validator of
a term. We identiﬁed 9 such targets in 19 ontologies. Principal ontologies exposing
this issue is described in Table 1. For example, the Gene Ontology (GO) contains
58,066 XRefs where the prefix:id notation is non consistently extrapolated to identify
one curator (e.g., GOC:jl), a group (e.g., GOC:go curators) or even a method (e.g.,
GOC:isa complete). The term ‘reproduction”(GO 0000003) for instance, contains the
three situations:6

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0001558">

<oboInOwl:hasDbXref rdf:datatype="xsd:string""> GOC:go_curators
</oboInOwl:hasDbXref> </owl:Class>

Identifying curators out of XRefs was not easy, and might not be error-proof; plus
in this case, we were not able to assign the identiﬁed targets an unambiguous identi-
ﬁer as we did before with URIs or URLs. We have reported the problem to the OBO
Foundry for follow-up7. Other examples of curated XRefs include go ref, which docu-
ments the author of terms via GitHub web pages. In the following, examples of other
curated XRefs:

• From GO, OMHT identiﬁed 3,885 XRefs to “go ref” (e.g., go ref:0000022);
• From PECO and TO ontology, OMHT identiﬁed 666 Xrefs to the preﬁx

“kegg compound” with no id values;

• In a similar way, from PECO ontology, OMHT identiﬁed 534 Xrefs to “iupac”.

4.2. Non-curated XRefs Analysis

Among the non-curated XRefs, we count 328,110 (34,3%) occurrences (82% of the to-
tal of non-curated XRefs) from the Protein Ontology to the UniProt Knowledge Base
(UniProtKB), which is an external resource for protein-related information. We were not
able to identify frequent target entities such as ‘PRO:DNx’, ‘PRO:JR’.

<owl:Class rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_000035415">

<oboInOwl:hasDbXref rdf:datatype="xsd:string"> PRO:DNx

</oboInOwl:hasDbXref></owl:Class>

For the rest of the non-curated cross-references (70,137), we were not able to iden-
tify the nature of the ambiguous targets (over a thousand) in reasonable curation time.
For the majority of targets found by OMHT on our corpus, half of them appear only one
or two times. We have discarded the less frequent occurrences and focused on the most
frequent ones. In the following, examples of non identiﬁed frequent targets that follow
the prefix:id notation include:

“po git” (e.g., po git:511)8;

• From PR and CL ontologies, OMHT identiﬁed 2,899 XRefs to IUPHARobj (e.g.,

IUPHARobj:250);

• From TRIPHASE thesaurus, OMHT identiﬁed 2,655 to “TyDI semClass” (e.g.,

TyDI semClass:4928444).

As a more detailed example, we found in the OntoBiotope ontology and the
TRIPHASE thesaurus, 6100 XRefs preﬁxed by ‘tydi’ (e.g., tydi:4927819). OMHT
was not able to ﬁnd this preﬁx in Identiﬁers.org nor the OBO foundry or an ontology
repository. We understood from exchanging with the developers of these semantic re-
sources that TyDI was a tool to assist in terminology extraction and these XRefs were
capturing some kind of design/provenance information. Of course, we were not able to
contact the developers of each ontology in which such a situation of ambiguous XRefs
targets occurred. Among the non-curated XRefs targets are many occurrences of speciﬁc
URLs that appear only once or twice in the corpus of XRefs. Although they probably
represent valid XRefs to Web pages, there are too many of them to be manually curated.

5. Discussion and recommendations

Our results show XRefs are largely employed by the community but hardly reusable
without heavy curation. With OMHT we were able to curate 58.3% of the identiﬁed
XRefs which means more than 40% of XRefs in our corpus are unusable, modulo a
signiﬁcantly longer time for curation (e.g., to contact ontology developer one by one).
We believe there are two major ways of enhancing the value and reusability of XRefs:

• Using more relevant speciﬁc properties taken from standard semantic Web meta-
data vocabularies to replace the tote-bag oboInOwl:hasDbXrefs property. For
instance, using the pav:curatedBy property to annotate a term with a curator or
skos:exactMatch to map to another ontology term.

• Using URIs or permanent URLs as much as possible to identify external entities.
For instance, using the ORCID or DOI permanent URL rather than the name of
the researcher or a miscellaneous reference to a digital object.

Searching for the right preﬁxes and ids is a complex and time-consuming task, which
affects any automation. We believe our study show the limits of the prefix:id notation
to which the use of unambiguous and permanent identiﬁers shall be preferred. Identi-
ﬁers.org helped in the process of resolving preﬁxes, but still sometimes ambiguity re-
mains and XRefs cannot be resolved. And getting the right preﬁx is only half of it.

OMHT extracted 102,370 mappings to ontology terms and 265,962 XRefs to RDF
dataset elements. In both cases, URIs always exists for the targets. Sometimes URIs
are used; why not systematically use them rather than an ambiguous prefix:id form?
OMHT extracted 91,584 XRefs to speciﬁc Web URLs either directly (e.g., Wikipedia
pages) or indirectly (e.g., ISBN or PMID). However, ontology developers are not follow-
ing any clear guidelines to link their term to external “online entities”. In some cases,
the prefix:id solution works ﬁne (e.g,. ISBN:0198506732), assuming the preﬁx can
be resolvable , but still this will require to always rely on an external resolving service,
whereas in many cases permanent URLs are already supported by the providers (e.g.,

8Those ones were assumed to reference a GitHub tracker issue maybe were the term was debated. We have

not investigated them further yet

https://isbndb.com/book/[ID], https://doi.org/[ID] or https://orcid.org/[ID]). We recom-
mend the use of speciﬁc annotation properties such as rdfs:seeAlso to link to a related
Web page or dct:bibliographicCitation to annotate a term with a citation. Using
speciﬁc annotation properties will result in a richer semantic integration.

Finally, in the case of XRefs documenting the curators of ontology terms, one may
prefer a property from the Provenance Ontology (a W3C Recommendation) or the Prove-
nance, Authoring and Versioning vocabulary that are recognized metadata standards:
pav:curatedBy, pav:authoredBy, pav:createdBy, prov:wasAttributedTo,
pav:contributedBy. The use of these properties will help humans and machines to
better identify and credit ontology contributors. In Table 2, we propose some ways to
mitigate the use of ambiguous XRefs by employing more relevant speciﬁc properties
taken from standard semantic Web metadata vocabularies.

Table 2. Property and value recommendations to mitigate the cases of ambiguous XRefs.

Situation

Mapping to
another term

XRef to RDF
dataset element

Link to Web page

Link to citations

Annotating curator of
a term

Link to database as a
whole

Property recommendation
Use owl:sameAs or owl:equivalentClass or SKOS mapping properties
(skos:exactMatch, skos:closeMatch) depending on the semantics.

Value recommendation
Use the URI of the term in the target
ontology.

Use owl:sameAs if the entities are semantically equivalent. Prefer a more
precise property to describe the exact relation between the ontology term and
the element (dct:isVersionOf, pav:derivedFrom, etc.).
Use rdfs:seeAlso or dcat:landingPage depending on the meaning of
the link.
Use dct:bibliographicCitation
Use a property from PROV-O or PAV such as pav:curatedBy,
pav:authoredBy, pav:createdBy, prov:wasAttributedTo,
pav:contributedBy
Use a speciﬁc property to describe the relation between the term and the
database. (e.g., schema:includedInDataCatalog or dct:source,
foaf:page).

Use the URI of the element in the target
RDF dataset.

Use directly the URL of the page as
identiﬁer.
Use the DOI or ISBN permanent URLs
Use ORCID permanent URLs or IDs
speciﬁc to a system but somehow
resolvable (e.g., GitHub accounts).
Use the best known identiﬁers for the
database if available or directly the
database URL.

6. Conclusion

Mappings between ontology terms and cross-references between a term and an external
database element or Web page are a very useful means for data integration and interop-
erability. These links are the backbone of the Linked Open Data vision [2]. However,
today, in the OBO world, the use of XRefs prevent the valorization of the information
originally captured by ontology developers; XRefs are poorly represented and semanti-
cally ambiguous. Miscellaneous uses of XRefs range from cross-references to database
elements or the databases as a whole, curators of a term, bibliographic citations, and in
some cases, mappings to related ontology terms.

In this paper, we have studied the use of XRefs in a corpus of 30 ontologies with the
original motivation to extract ontology mappings in the AgroPortal ontology repository.
We have designed and developed OMHT, a tool to semi-automatically extract and har-
monize XRefs from AgroPortal ontologies. Nevertheless, out of almost one million ex-
tracted XRefs, we have identiﬁed only 10,7% of them representing the mapping between
terms which conﬁrms that XRefs are primarily something other than inter-ontology map-
pings. When ontology developers use XRefs to reuse a term from another ontology,
OMHT resolves the targets quite easily. However, for the other 89,3%, XRefs are quite
ambiguous to be resolved by OMHT. Our study quantiﬁes the different cases of uses
of XRefs while establishing the mandatory curation needed to reuse them. Even with
manual curation, we were unable to give sense to a bit more than 40% of the XRefs
in our corpus, which demonstrate the loss of information and efforts originally invested

by ontology developers. We have discussed recommendations on means to mitigate this
situation, mostly by using more relevant metadata properties and identiﬁers.

To get more insights about the use of the XRefs and reﬁne our recommendations, as
future work, we plan to analyse the usage of XRefs in a bigger corpus of ontologies from
the “OBO world”. We will however, make a distinction between the ontologies formally
declared in the OBO library (www.obofoundry.org) an the others. This will help the
OBO community to identify the issues and possibly move forward. Our work could also
be extended to study other ways of capturing ontology cross-references (not only XRefs).
