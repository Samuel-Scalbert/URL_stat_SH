Abstract : The recent development of data analysis provides opportunities for improving healthcare sys-
tems through analysis of health databases. However the thirst for data is conﬂicting with preserving the
privacy of individuals. The generation of synthetic datasets may foster research on healthcare data analyt-
ics. It is mostly based on generative statistical models ﬁtted on real data. Thus it still requires access to
sensitive data. This article proposes a probabilistic relational model (Getoor et al., 2007) ﬁtted on publicly
available datasets. Public healthcare statistics provide valuable information to mimic statistical distributions
and do not hold sensitive personal data. More speciﬁcally, we propose to generate synthetic version of the
national database of French insured patients. We do not only provide synthetic datasets, but a generator of
datasets that can be used without any data access request. Experiments compare ofﬁcial statistics with those
computed on synthetic datasets.

Introduction

The SNDS, formerly SNIIRAM, is a huge database (several Tb of data and about 700 ta-
bles) that contains information about healthcare reimbursements of about 60 million French
insured patients (Tuppin & et al., 2017). This database is used to carry out epidemiological
and medical-economic studies. Due to its sensitive medical content, identifying information
(names, social security numbers) is removed or replaced by spurious information. Neverthe-
less, due to its richness, this database is not considered as anonymized. Consequently, its use
is regulated and its access is restricted. Nonetheless, data owners would like to encourage
research to derive the maximum possible beneﬁt from it.

The access restriction to the SNDS hampers the possibilities of experimenting with new
(machine learning) algorithms or studying their reproducibility. Without easy access to the
data, researchers and engineers can not evaluate the effectiveness or the usefulness of their
off-the-shelf algorithms. And, without hints about the potential utility of their algorithm, they
are not spurred to request access to the database (which is a tedious process).

A solution is to generate and publicly release synthetic data (Jordon et al., 2020; Tucker
et al., 2020). The generated data needs to mimic the real data in a structural way – in order
to prepare and test preprocessing tools that access the raw database – and in a statistical way
– in order to be conﬁdent that conclusions drawn on synthetic data will apply to the real data.
Then, the challenge is threefold: 1) to generate relational data compliant with the original
database schema, 2) to generate as realistic data distributions as possible and 3) to guarantee
privacy preservation.

Synthetic data is a trending approach for affording widespread access to sensitive data
(Raghunathan, 2021). A wide range of machine learning techniques are available to provide
possible solutions. In particular, generative models (e.g. GAN (Yale et al., 2019), Bayesian
models (Chulyadyo & Leray, 2018; Liu, 2016; Tucker et al., 2020), parameterized statisti-
cal models (Wu et al., 2018)) can be trained to generate synthetic data. These techniques
have been integrated in tools dedicated to synthetic data generation, such as Synthetic Data
Vault (Xu et al., 2019) or SynthPop (Nowok et al., 2017) and are mainly applied on medical

IA & Santé 2021

datasets. Only a few approaches (Chulyadyo & Leray, 2018; Xu et al., 2019) deal with rela-
tional data (i.e. multiple tables of a relational database). Modeling relation data raises more
challenges for GAN models.

In the above approaches, the realism of the data is the primary objective, and they do not
provide privacy guarantees. For instance, they may reveal sensitive information about real
people with rare diseases (Stadler et al., 2020). A trade-off must therefore be found between
realism and privacy. GAN-DP (Qu et al., 2019) or DL-DP (Abadi et al., 2016) enhanced
these approaches with differential privacy safeguards. But again, these approaches require
primary access to real data.

Our approach also trains a statistical model to generate synthetic data but does not require
access to the original database. The difference lies in the use of (aggregated) open data to ﬁt
the model. Our statistical model is based on a Probabilistic Relational Model (PRM) (Getoor
et al., 2007) which enables us to generate relational data compliant with the SNDS schema.
Thus, the objective is not only to provide a synthetic dataset, but also to provide a generator
that anyone can use (and adapt) with guarantees to reveal no more information than that
available in open data.

2 Probabilistic relational models (PRM)

Probabilistic relational models (PRMs) extend Bayesian networks with the concepts of ob-
jects, their properties, and relations between them. It enables multiple instances of a class
(e.g. multiple care events of a patient) to be modeled without having to ground the entire
Bayesian network (one statistical variable for each event).

The following formal deﬁnitions are borrowed from Getoor et al. (2007). A schema for a
relational model describes a set of classes (or slots), X = {X1, . . . , Xn}. The set of descrip-
tive attributes of a class X is denoted A(X). Then, X.A (resp. x.A) denotes the attribute
A of the class X (resp. value of attribute A of an instance x), and V(X.A) is the domain of
X.A. Each X.A can be seen as a random variable. Similarly to Bayesian networks, a PRM
represents conditional dependencies between variables using a set of parents P a(X.A). It
distinguishes between dependencies for individual objects and dependencies on attributes of
related objects (so-called slot chain). An instance of a relational model speciﬁes for each
class X, a set of objects by its attributes. A relational skeleton σr of a relational schema
is a partial speciﬁcation of an instance of the schema. More speciﬁcally, the skeleton of a
PRM speciﬁes the number of instances of each class. It may also ﬁll object attributes with
predeﬁned values.

The joint distribution over the instantiations of a PRM, Π, for a relational skeleton, σr, is

very similar to the chain rule for standard Bayesian networks.

Pr(I|σr, Π) =

(cid:89)

(cid:89)

(cid:89)

Pr(x.A|P a(x.A))

X∈X

A∈A(X )

x∈σr(X)

A synthetic database is a concrete sample of this joint distribution. Its generation has two
goals: to generate a relational skeleton and to sample values to feed into the skeleton. The
skeleton speciﬁes a number of objects for each class. Chulyadyo & Leray (2018) consider
two solutions: a relational skeleton with a nearly equal number of objects of each class, or
the use of k-partite graph generation algorithm. Our solution is to add a random variable per
class X ∈ X , denoted X.N , that is the number of objects. These random variables are not
descriptive attributes but are conditioned to variables of the PRM.

In the particular case of an acyclic conditional dependency graph, value sampling applies
forward the probabilistic relational model from the roots of the covering tree of the dependen-
cies (R) to create an instance of the database. It leads to the sampling algorithm illustrated
in Algorithm 1. Contrary to Chulyadyo & Leray (2018) who generate a skeleton beforehand,
our skeleton is constructed during instance generation. For a slot, the number of its instances
is drawn prior to generating instances of this slot.

3 Probabilistic relational model of the SNDS

In this section, we ﬁrst present the SNDS with a focus on information that is useful to conduct
epidemiological studies. Then, we propose a PRM that speciﬁes the generation of synthetic
data.

The SNDS database has been set up for healthcare reimbursements. It has multiple facets:
consultations (general practitioners and specialists), drug deliveries, biological procedures,
hospitalizations, transport, dental care, nursing care. For each reimbursement, the database
contains information about the patient, the providers (e.g. doctors, pharmacies) and the type
of care through coding. It is worth noting that the SNDS is a reimbursement database. It does
not contain exam results or medical reports.

The SNDS is composed of 692 tables, including 505 nomenclature tables which can be
copied from the original database. Nomenclature tables contain descriptions of the standard
codes (e.g. ATC codes, ICD codes), drug prices, care giver categories, etc. In addition, many
administrative and economic tables are included, but not useful to generate for epidemiolog-
ical purposes. Finally, based on the tables that are mostly queried by epidemiologists, we
decided to discard speciﬁc types of care such dental care, optical care, physiotherapists, psy-
chiatric stays and home care. Finally, 10 tables representing the core of a patient care pathway
are actually generated. These tables are shown in Figure 1 and their meaningful attributes are
detailed below. The names of tables correspond to the names used in the original schema.1

• DA_PRA_R: healthcare providers (doctors, pharmacies, nurses, etc.). A provider is

1http://dico-snds.health-data-hub.fr/

IA & Santé 2021

deﬁned by their specialty and location (city code).

• IR_BEN_R: healthcare patients. This table contains information on the age, gender,
city of residence, and information about the long-term illness reimbursement regime
(so-called ALD). ALD provides information about chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes or
cancers).

• T_MCO_B: Hospitalizations (short stay) for which there is an entry and a discharge
date, as well as information about the main reason for hospitalization (ICD code).

• T_MCO_D/T_MCO_A: associated diagnoses/procedures. These tables contain respec-

tively associated diagnoses and medical procedures for a hospitalization.

• T_MCO_E: hospitals and care institutions.

• ER_PRS_F: This table lists the care expenses (excluding inpatient care) which are
reimbursed to a patient, after being prescribed by a doctor and provided by a care
professional. Each reimbursement has a date and a code related to the nature of the care
(e.g. drug delivery, consultation, biology). Biological procedures, drug deliveries and
medical procedures are detailed in tables ER_BIO_F, ER_CAM_F and ER_PHA_F.
Their main attribute is a standard code.

A PRM has been derived from the schema illustrated in Figure 1. It speciﬁes the variables
to sample and it models the conditional dependencies between them. The proposed model is
illustrated in Figure 2. The overall structure of the model is close to the database schema. The
patient class is at the center, and it is surrounded by slots describing care (medical procedures,
drug deliveries, biological procedures and hospital stays). Note that slots for T_MCO_E and
T_MCO_D tables are not represented in this schema for the sake of readability. Each slot
holds a variable N which is the number of its record in the database, but it is not formally a
slot attribute. It is worth noting that the choice of conditional dependencies has been guided
by modeling purposes but it has been also constrained by data availability (see next section).
A patient is described by four random variables. Gender (G), residence location (L, a city
code) and age (A) conditionally depend on the department (French administrative division) of
residence D. This means that we model the population by a distribution Pr(G, A, L|D). The
long-term illness reimbursement regime therefore depends on the three above variables. Let’s
now have a look at the Procedure slot which represents the medical procedures to generate in
the ER_CAM_F table. CCCAM is a code in the French classiﬁcation of medical procedures.
For instance, an imagery procedure will more likely be performed by a radiologist than by
an oncologist. Then, the arrow from the triple G, A, L to CCCAM states that we model the
conditional probabilities Pr(CCCAM | G, A, L) i.e. the probability of having a medical pro-
cedure of type CCCAM during the year given the patient characteristics. The drugs delivered
(CAT C), reason for hospitalization (CICD) or type of biological procedures (CN ABM ) depend
on the patient only, but not on the care giver. For hospitalization, the in-hospital procedures
(CHCCAM ) depend on the primary reason for hospital stay (CICD). It is the same for a related
diagnosis (not represented). The Consult slot represents medical consultations (ER_PRS_F).
The only attribute of this slot is the medical specialty (S) of the care giver that also depends
on patient type (G, A, L). For instance, women are more likely to consult gynecologists than
men.

The generation of synthetic data is conﬁgured by specifying a year of simulation and a list
of departments whose population is to be mimicked. These parameters are used to generate a
synthetic population and care professionals. Care professionals (physicians by specialty and
care institutions) of these departments are extracted from public ofﬁcial lists.2 As there is no
cycle in the graph of conditional dependencies (see Figure 2), the Algorithm 1 is applied. It
starts by generating a patient population. Then, for each patient, his/her possible ALDs are
generated according to his/her age, gender and location. Then, treatments are generated as

follows: 1. draw the number of treatments of a given nature (hospitalization, visit, procedure,
etc.) a patient had during the year using Pr(N |A, G, L); 2. draw the code (ICD, CCAM,
ATC or NABM code) for each treatment using the probability of observing one code (e.g.
Pr(CAT C|A, G, L) or Pr(CCCAM |A, G, L)).

4 Conditional probability estimation from open data

To estimate the distributions of the conditional probabilities of our model, we propose to use
data available in French open data repositories. The European Open Data Directive of 2019
requires administrations to make their data readily available, especially in the ﬁeld of health.
Most health datasets are composed of data aggregated from the real SNDS. Thus it enables
the distribution of our PRM to be estimated: the Open Damir database3 contains informa-
tion about out-of-hospital reimbursements; the Open Medic database4 describes expenditure
by drug code, patient age, gender and location; and by prescriber specialty: the number of
patients, the total amount of boxes delivered. The Open CCAM database5 describes reim-
bursements of out-of-hospital medical procedures. The Open Bio database6 describes reim-
bursements of medical biology procedures.

In addition, we use aggregated data7 from hospitals about the primary, related and associ-
ated diagnoses and about the technical medical procedures carried out in hospitals. Finally,
we use French population statistics8 by city, gender and 5-year age group.

Challenges arise due to the incompleteness of the available information. Aggregate datasets
are provided for analysis on three variables of the patient: age group, gender and location.
Depending on the datasets, care deliveries are linked to characteristics of the provider, in par-
ticular his or her medical specialty. The aggregates are numbers of care events (e.g. number
of drugs deliveries) or numbers of patients per care type given the value of these variables.

In practice, aggregates are rarely provided at a ﬁne level of detail for all these variables,
but more often for one or two of them. For instance, the total number of drug deliveries

(or biological procedures) is provided per department and per gender. Additionally, the total
number of drug deliveries per department and per age group is available. This separation
prevents possible re-identiﬁcation of individuals. The joint distribution is reconstructed from
the marginal distributions assuming conditional independence.

In the following, we present the principle of estimating distributions for the generation of
the information in the P rocedure slot, i.e. the medical procedures which are performed by
doctors including for example imaging procedures (radiology), surgical procedures, etc. We
aim at estimating a quantity of procedures and their distribution:

• Pr(P roc.N |A, G, L): the probability of the number of procedures knowing the gender,

age and department of residence of the beneﬁciary,

• Pr(CCCAM |A, G, L): the probability of a CCAM code for an procedure knowing the

gender, age and department of residence of the beneﬁciary.

Unfortunately, open data does not contain information to compute Pr(CCCAM | A, G, L)
exactly. On the one hand, the OpenDamir dataset gives the amount of procedures per group
of procedures (radiology, ultrasound, other imaging, obstetrics, surgery, technical procedures,
anesthesia) given the ﬁve-year age group, gender and location of the patient. This enables the
Pr(GA|A, G, L) to be computed where GA is the group of procedures. On the other hand,
we have information about the total amount of detailed CCAM procedures per group which
gives Pr(CCCAM |GA). Then, we approximate the probability of a CCAM code as follows:
Pr(CCCAM |A, G, L) = (cid:80)

Pr(CCCAM |GA) × Pr(GA|A, G, L).
Furthermore, the distribution of the number of medical procedures (Pr(P roc.N | A, G, L))
of a patient during the year is modeled by an exponential law parameterized by an average
number of procedures given the age, gender and location of the patient. This average number
of procedures is approximated using the same technique as above.

5 Experiments

All the tools presented in this article are available online9: 1) the procedures for loading open
data (including recent SNDS schema and nomenclatures), 2) Python notebooks for prepara-
tion of the datasets and distribution estimations and 3) the simulation tool. These end-to-end
tools enable the generation of a synthetic SNDS in a SQLite database. We have collected
datasets for the year 2016. More data are available for this year than for other more recent
years and 2016 is sufﬁciently recent to be representative of the current situation. The simu-
lation is set up to generate ten populations of 10,000 people in 2019 and to mimic the patient
population of the French Brittany region (four departments).

The objective of the experiments is to show that the generation of synthetic data reproduces
the data distributions that are known from real open source data. For the sake of conciseness,
we focus on population, drug deliveries and medical procedures. We present distributions
of one synthetic dataset and the Jensen?Shannon divergence measure (JS) averaged over the
10 datasets. Chi-squared homogeneity tests assessed that there is no signiﬁcant difference
between the real and synthetic distributions. Extended results are available in the code repos-
itory on different database instances and for the other facets.

5.1 Population generation

Figure 3 compares the actual (blue) and synthetic (orange) distributions of the population by
gender and age. For the real population, the numbers of people are proportionally reduced
to the population size of the synthetic cohort. The synthetic and real data distributions are
globally very close. For the age distribution, there is a tendency to underestimate the number
of people aged over 70 but to overestimate those under 20. Nevertheless, the difference is
small overall (DKL = 4.52 × 10−3).

synthetic population (in orange) and in the real national population (in blue). At the bottom:
Distribution of the number of drugs per ATC group (level 2).

5.2 Distribution of drugs

Figure 4 (bottom) illustrates the results of the generation of drug deliveries. The numbers of
deliveries are grouped by drug code from the second level of ATC. Therefore, the simula-
tion enables both the numbers of deliveries and their distribution by type of drug to be rather
faithfully represented (overall relative difference of 12% and DKL = 4.02 × 10−3). Despite
the wide disparity between the numbers of drugs per ATC code, the most frequently deliv-
ered drugs are also the most frequently delivered drugs in the synthetic cohort. These good
results can be explained by the accuracy of the drug dataset, which details quantities by age,
gender and region. The conditional distribution has been estimated without any additional
assumptions.

5.3 Out-of-hospital procedures

Figure 4 (top) illustrates the actual and synthetic distributions of medical technical procedures
(CCAM codes) for the codes from NFKA008 to QEQK005. The proportions of procedures
are rather faithful to reality, but the quantities are globally underestimated. Moreover, for
certain rather frequent procedures (e.g. PCQM001), the quantities of procedures present
in the synthetic data are quite signiﬁcantly lower (overall relative difference of 44% and
DKL = 4.56 × 10−2). These differences are due to the use of groups of procedures to obtain
distribution conditionally dependent on gender and age.

These different experiments show that the data generation process reproduces the charac-
teristics of SNDS data according to different facets of the care pathway. As expected, the
facets for which the data are ﬁnely described in the open datasets (e.g. drugs) are more faith-
fully reproduced than for the less well described facets (medical procedures). Nevertheless,

IA & Santé 2021

it shows that the information available in open data makes it possible to generate synthetic
data with meaningful epidemiological features.

6 Conclusion and perspectives

We proposed a tool for the generation of a synthetic SNDS. This approach does not require
access to the original dataset and allows anyone to generate their own database. The advan-
tages are to generate data respecting the complex SNDS schema and to reproduce real global
characteristics of care used in epidemiological studies. The databases generated beneﬁt from
the privacy preservation measures applied on open data. Thus, generated datasets can be used
to technically evaluate tools before transferring them to real data. A ﬁrst perspective would
be to enrich the tool with additional care facets (e.g. nursing care, odontology). The second
area for improvement is to generate more consistent individual pathways. A ﬁrst direction
would be to explore the use of expert constraints (does not require using new data). The sec-
ond direction would be to use individual data to statistically model the pathways in order to
mimic them. The constraints of preserving privacy would then have to be taken into account.
