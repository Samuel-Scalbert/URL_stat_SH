Abstract

Automated plant identification has recently improved significantly due to advances in deep
learning   and   the   availability   of   large   amounts   of   field   photos.   As   an   illustration,   the
classification accuracy of 10K species measured in the LifeCLEF challenge (Goëau et al.
2018) reached 90%, very close to that of human experts. However, the profusion of field
images only concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mainly located in North America
and   Western   Europe.   Conversely,   the   richest   regions   in   terms   of   biodiversity,   such   as
tropical countries, suffer from a shortage of training data (Pitman 2021). Consequently, the
identification performance of the most advanced models on the flora of these regions is
much lower (Goëau et al. 2019). 

Nevertheless, for several centuries, botanists have systematically collected, catalogued,
and   stored   plant   specimens   in   herbaria.   Considerable   recent   efforts   by   the   biodiversity
informatics community, such as DiSSCo (Addink et al. 2018) and iDigBio (Matsunaga et al.
2013), have made millions of digitized specimens from these collections available online. A
key question is therefore whether these digitized specimens could be used to improve the
identification performance of species for which we have very few (if any) photos. However,
this is a very difficult problem from a machine learning point of view. The visual appearance
of a herbarium specimen is actually very different from a field photograph because the
specimens are dried and crushed on a herbarium sheet before being digitized (Fig. 1).

stipitata Diels).

To advance research on this topic, we built a large dataset that we shared as one of the
challenges of the LifeCLEF 2020 (Goëau et al. 2020) and 2021 evaluation campaigns (
Goëau et al. 2021). It includes more than 320K herbarium specimens collected mostly from
the   Guiana   Shield   and   the   Northern   Amazon   Rainforest,   focusing   on   about   1K   plant
species of the French Guiana flora. A valuable asset of this collection is that some of the
specimens are accompanied by a few photos of the same specimen, allowing for more
precise machine learning. In addition to this training data, we also built a test set for model
evaluation,   composed   of   3,186   field   photos   collected   by   two   of   the   best   experts   on
Guyanese flora. 

Based on this dataset, about ten research teams have developed deep learning methods
to address the challenge (including the authors of this abstract as the organizing team). A
detailed description of these methods can be found in the technical notes written by the
participating teams (Goëau et al. 2020, Goëau et al. 2021). The methods can be divided
into two categories:

•

•

those based on classical convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained simply by
mixing digitized specimens and photos and
those   based   on   advanced   domain   adaptation   techniques   with   the   objective   of
learning a joint representation space between field and herbarium representations.

The domain adaptation methods themselves were of two types, those based on

1.

2.

adversarial regularization (Motiian et al. 2017) to force herbarium specimens and
photos to have the same representations,
metric   learning  to   maximize   inter-species   distances   and   minimize   intra-species
distances in the representation space

In Table 1, we report the results achieved by the different methods evaluated during the
2020   edition   of   the   challenge.   The   evaluation   metric   used   is   the   mean   reciprocal   rank
(MRR), i.e., the average of the inverse of the rank of the correct species in the list of the
predicted species. In addition to this main score, a second MRR score is computed on a
subset of the test set composed of the most difficult species, i.e., the ones that are the
least frequently photographed in the field. The main outcomes we can derive from these
results are the following:

Classical deep learning models fail to identify plant photos from digitized herbarium
specimens. The best classical CNN trained on the provided data resulted in a very low
MRR score (0.011). Even with the of use additional training data (e.g. photos and digitized
herbarium from GBIF) the MRR score remains very low (0.039). 

Domain adaptation methods provide significant improvement but the task remains
challenging.  The   best   MRR   score   (0.180)   was   achieved   by   using   adversarial
regularization   (FSDA  Motiian   et   al.   2017).   This   is   much   better   than   the   classical   CNN
models but there is still a lot of progress to be made to reach the performance of a truly
functional identification system (the MRR score on classical plant identification tasks can
be up to 0.9). 

No method fits all. As shown in Table 1, the metric learning method has a significantly
better MRR score on the most difficult species (0.107). However, the performance of this
method on the species with more photos is much lower than the adversarial technique. 

In 2021, the challenge was run again but with additional information provided to train the
models, i.e., species traits (plant life form, woodiness and plant growth form). The use of
the   species   traits   allowed   slight   performance   improvement   of   the   best   adversarial
adaptation method (with a MRR equal to 0.198). 

In conclusion, the results of the experiments conducted are promising and demonstrate the
potential interest of digitized herbarium data for automated plant identification. However,

progress   is   still   needed   before   integrating   this   type   of   approach   into   production
applications.
