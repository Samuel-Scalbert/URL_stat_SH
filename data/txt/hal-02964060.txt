Introduction 
Rhizodeposition,  i.e.  the  release  of  organic  materials  by  roots,  represents  a  significant 
portion  of  plant’s  carbon  (C)  budget,  ranging  from  5%  to  15%  of  net  photosynthesized  C 
(Pausch and Kuzyakov, 2018). Various rhizodeposits can be released by roots, e.g. soluble 
exudates,  secreted  mucilage,  sloughed  cells,  or  volatile  organic  compounds.  Despite  their 
short  lifetime,  some  of  these  products  have  been  shown  to  favor  plant  growth,  e.g.  by 
increasing water and nutrient uptake. Among rhizodeposition processes, exudation has been 
suggested  to  depend  on  the  concentration  of  carbohydrates  inside  the  roots  (Personeni  et 
al.,  2007).  However,  rhizodeposition  not  only  depends  on  the  availability  of  C  in  the  roots, 
but also on the architecture of the root system, and many have shown that rhizodeposits are 
more concentrated in specific areas, such as root tips. Consequently, a Functional-Structural 
Plant  Model  (FSPM)  would  theoretically  represent  the  best  framework  for  simulating  the 
spatial and temporal dynamics of rhizodeposition, as it can describe the evolution of both the 
metabolism and the architecture of the plant. The objective of this work is to create such a 
framework by coupling a whole-plant FSPM, a 3D root architectural model, and a new model 
simulating rhizodeposition. 

Modelling approach 
Our  strategy  has  been  to  combine  the  FSPM  CN-Wheat  (Barillot  et  al.,  2016),  which 
describes  the  main  processes  of  C  and  nitrogen  (N)  acquisition  and  transformation  by  an 
individual  wheat  plant  and  the  3D  growth  and  development  of  its  aerial  organs,  with  the 
model  ArchiSimple  (Pagès  et  al.,  2014)  that  simulates  the  development  of  the  3D  root 
architecture for a range of plant species, and the new model  RhizoDep, which calculates a 
full C balance in each part of a root system in order to simulate local rhizodeposition fluxes. 
The  complementarity  of  the  three  models  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1:  i)  CN-Wheat  is  used to 
calculate the amount of C allocated from the shoots to the roots, ii) ArchiSimple provides the 
3D structure of the root system, and iii)  RhizoDep distributes the C provided by the shoots 
within the 3D root system and simulates the actual growth, respiration and rhizodeposition of 
each root element based on C availability. The major link between the three models lies in 
the  exchange  of  C  between  aboveground  and  belowground  tissues,  which  is  driven  by 
gradients of sucrose concentration in the different compartments of the plant. 

Preliminary results & short-term perspectives 
The  coupling  of  the  three  models  has  been  started  using  the  OpenAlea  platform  and  its 
Multiscale Tree Graph formalism (Pradal et al., 2008). First simulations were done using the 
allocation of C to the roots simulated by CN-Wheat as an input to the root model based on 
the  effective  coupling  of  ArchiSimple  and  RhizoDep.  These  simulations  show  how 
rhizodeposition  is  intrinsically  dependent  on  the  architecture  of  the  root  system  and  on  the 
total  amount  of  available  C.  For  completing  the  coupling,  several  issues  still  need  to  be

may  be  regulated  by  local  C  and  N  availability,  and  how  rhizodeposition  can  modify  soil  N 
availability.  However,  this  modelling  approach  has  already  led  to  a  first  prototype  able  to 
simulate  rhizodeposition  processes  on  a  dynamic,  3D  root  system  that  is  fully  integrated 
within  the  functioning  of  the  whole  plant.  Its  refinement  will  offer  unique  opportunities  to 
study the possible link between rhizodeposition and the environmental factors affecting plant 
growth, e.g. atmospheric CO2 concentration or soil N availability.
