Abstract

The objective of this work was to propose an environmental scoring tool for food

packaging based on the assessment of three key pillars of packaging sustainability:

Materials, Functionality and Post-Usage fate. A participatory process involving

relevant food-packaging experts and end users was applied to define the relevant

criteria for each pillar. Each criterion was translated into a question for users, and the

answers are converted into a score between 0 (worst option) and 1 (best option) per

pillar. For the Materials pillar, two scores were computed from a streamlined

calculation of resource (CEENE) and carbon footprints (IPCC) while for the Function-

ality and Post-Usage pillars, scores were computed from Yes/No answers provided

by the users. A fourth pillar considers the potential risk of long-term environmental

pollution. Then, the packaging options for the same food are ranked according to the

Borda voting rule, considering the individual rankings obtained for the various pillars.

The proposed methodology was applied to three commercial (milk and sugar) and

non-commercial

(strawberry) packaging case studies. The obtained ranking is

discussed with respect to current knowledge in the field. The provided methodology

is easy to understand, science based, and combines quantitative and qualitative

assessments. The developed tool could be handled by non-experts in environmental

sciences such as food manufacturers, packaging converters and policy makers. The

resulting indicators provide answers to user concerns regarding the environmental

impacts of food packaging and guide their choice of the most sustainable option. The

proposed scoring method considers the functionality of the packaging with respect

to preserving food and reducing food waste, which is rarely considered in packaging

environmental assessments.

aspect is considered important, although it is often neglected in most
existing assessment tools (Table 1). Criteria such as ‘protection’,
‘shelf-life’,
‘protection against physiological degradation’, ‘against
drying’ and ‘against oxidation’ were frequently quoted by the
interviewees, who argued that ‘the packaging must have the correct
functionality to protect the product’. A criterion cited six times was
‘informs about the conditions of preservation and use’, confirming

the importance of labels explaining the storage conditions to ensure

the full functionality of the packaging to preserve the food. Other cri-
teria mentioned were ‘(re)sealability’, ‘sales unit’ and ‘individual por-
tions’ (to avoid leftovers and FLW).

The second-most quoted category of arguments was the

end-of-life category (26%, Figure 1), highlighting the stakeholders'

recycling. Currently, mostly mechanical recycling (closed-loop or

open-loop processes)
is implemented at the plant scale, so we
assumed that ‘recycling’, as understood by the interviewees, means

mechanical recycling. Finally, the interviewees also highlighted the

importance of packaging labelling with clear instructions about the

sorting conditions.

The third-most quoted category of arguments was Raw Material &
Resources (20%, Figure 1). ‘Origin of the materials’, ‘geography’,
‘geographical origin’,
‘bioplastics’ and
‘recycled materials’ were all quoted several times. Other arguments
referred to the ethical aspect of the production ‘In all stages, the

equality) and the social-societal side must be taken into account’ or

the origin of the biomass in case of bio-based plastics should not have
‘competitive uses (e.g., animal feed, compost)’ and should not increase

pressure on land and food resources. Another category of arguments

related to raw materials refers to controversial substances (such as

GMO and chemical solvents) that may be found in packaging

formulations or chemical products/solvents that may be used to

produce or extract the raw material used in the packaging.

agreement with the food needs?)

Does the packaging provide protection against light? (e.g., opaque material when needed for a light-

sensitive product)

Does the packaging provide a good gas barrier? (for oxygen-sensitive products, principally products

containing vitamins, unsaturated fats, dry products with risk of rancidity, is the OTR value on technical
sheets in agreement with the food needs?)

Is the packaging solution designed at the just necessary/optimal level? (are there any attempts using

modelling tools or experimental approaches to optimise the pack, reduce the number of components, or
decrease the packaging thickness to achieve the same food shelf life and standard conditions of use; does
the packaging contains the right amount of product)

| GLOPACK packaging score outputs

The pillar approach presented above provides four different scores

between 0 (worst option) and 1 (best option): two scores for Materials

(resource footprint and carbon footprint scores), one for Functionality,

and one for Post-Usage (Figure 2). These scores can be used to

analyse which aspect of the packaging life cycle has the greatest

impact and identify the hot spots and potential for improvement. Each

score has a related reliability index (Equation 5) that indicates the

percentage of known values used to calculate the scores. Even when

the data for the packaging material

is incomplete, a score can be

calculated, considering the worst case as the missing value by default.

The reliability index decreases with an increasing number of missing
data. For the Functionality and Post-Usage pillars, the ‘I do not know’

sive lifecycle inventory data.

The developed tool fulfilled all the initial specifications defined by

the working group. The Materials pillar does not focus only on climate

change, but considers both the carbon and resources footprints,
which is novel compared to existing methods, such as the EEFP tool.19

Our tool considers the functionality of the packaging material, which

is still lacking in many scoring and eco-design tools (apart from EEFP),

and the long-term fate in the environment and risk of micro/

nanoparticle generation that is especially relevant for plastic-based

materials. The post-usage options are regionally dependent, and our

tool provides different scores depending on the country. This tool is

accessible to non-LCA experts and does not require the input of data

and knowledge that is generally lacking in many food companies. The

intended user is a packaging or food company that needs to select

suitable packaging for a given food. Our tool can help the user

improve the score of existing packaging by identifying the pillars that

require further improvements. Although our tool cannot be used to

directly design a new packaging format,

it could be useful

in the

packaging-development step by providing insights into reducing the

environmental impact of a packaging solution, by, for instance, testing

different materials or judging a panel of existing packaging. When use

in the development phase, some criteria must be answered based on

assumptions that, for instance, people really understand the new

packaging concept, the way of emptying, disposing, etc. These

assumptions need to be validated once the final design is set up

together with the economic and technical feasibility of the solutions

suggested by the tool.

The GLOPACK packaging score is evolutive because it is scalable

and can be easily upgraded with new criteria to consider new regula-

tions and scientific breakthroughs in the domain of packaging science.
