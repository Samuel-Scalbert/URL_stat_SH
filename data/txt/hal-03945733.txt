q To analyze, confim or refute public statements

q To expose and explain society functioning

Fact-checking/data journalism problems

Graph-based integration of 
heterogeneous data sources
q The sources are not RDF. They can be 

(semi)structured, or unstructured (text).

q The sources may be very dynamic (projects
started and abandoned as per news cycle
and data availability). 

q There is no schema. Data producers often uncollaborative. 

q For most journalists, databases do not come naturally, and IT support is 

limited. They know keyword-based search…

Integrate heterogeneous sources within a graph, query w/ keywords

ConnctionLens principles

ConnectionLens principles [VLDBdemo2018]
Integrate any kind of data into a graph

Extract entities from any text node (regardless of the model of the data source 
where the text comes from)

q Same entity in two different text nodes = 

link among the text nodes (densification of the graph)

The graph is heterogeneous and irregular à

Query it through keywords: find trees that connect 1 node matching each kwd

q Closely related to the Group Steiner Tree Problem (GSTP)

Ioana Manolescu, Inria and Institut Polytechnique de Paris             DEBS Keynote, June 2022

ConnectionLens graph querying

Querying problem statement

q Given the graph G = (N, E) built out of the datasets D and a query Q= {w1, ...,wm}, 

return the k highest-score minimal answer trees.

q An answer tree is a set of edges which (i) form a tree (ii) contain at least one node 

whose label matches each keyword wi.

q We are interested in minimal answer trees, that is: 

q Removing an edge from the tree should make it lack some keyword(s).
q If a keyword matches more than one nodes in the answer tree, then all these 

matching nodes must be equivalent.

36

ConnectionLens graph querying

Search space and complexity

q Problem  related to the (Group) Steiner Tree Problem

q Given graph G, and nodes n1, . . . , nm, the Steiner Tree Problem (STP) requires the 
smallest tree in G that connects all the nodes. Known NP-hard problem in |G|

q Group STP: start with m groups of nodes

q Differences with our problem: 

q Each edge can be taken in both directions: exponential increase in search space size
q We need the k smallest-cost trees, not just one.
q Support arbitrary score functions

q Large literature (30+) on kwd search in data graphs. 

q Differ in search space and/or make limitative assumptions on score

q Our approach: enumerate solutions until time-out or max number of solutions reached.

q Return best k solutions found, for given score function

37

ConnectionLens query algorithm

GAM (Grow and Aggressive Merge) Algorithm
q Builds trees exploring around the keyword matches
q GROW adds an edge to the root of a tree, MERGE merges trees with the same root

ConnectionLens query algorithm

GAM (Grow and Aggressive Merge) Algorithm
q Builds trees exploring around the keyword matches
q GROW adds an edge to the root of a tree, MERGE merges trees with the same root

Every solution is a conection (edge set): the root is not meaningful to users
Ideally, we should develop each edge set only once... But: 
q Grow and Merge depend on the tree root à Many edge sets with the same root
q Also, there are many Grow-Merge combinations that produce the same rooted tree!

Optimizations and careful pruning to keep exploration highly efficient (ongoing)

Data integration for structured, semistructured and unstructured data

q “Ad-hoc” (combinations of sources to be unioned, joined, or chained)

q No schema, ontologies, queries known in advance

q Reachability queries instead of join: price to pay for powerful integration

q Comparable work by R. S. Roy, G. Weikum: GST querying of RDF graph enriched on-

the-fly with content extracted from Web sources

q Web info may be missing or not trusted

Data cleaning: Similarity links require value or entity matching

q Use reference data sources, heuristics, interactive cleaning (under integrated)

Why data journalism?

Because I grew up in a dictatorship, and I value free press

Because journalists are threatened and killed still today in Europe

Daphne Galizia, 1964-2017 

Jan Kuciak, 1990-2018 

Because the press' economic model is threatened by IT giants

Because this industry is currently underserved by IT – and we could really make an 
impact!
