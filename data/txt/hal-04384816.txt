Abstract—Knowledge or information sharing is one of the
foundational principles shared by the Web and any well function-
ing decentralised multi-agent system (MAS). Another is interop-
erability. Engineers of MAS follow design strategies for ensuring
interoperability that range from using a common ontology to
using translation mechanisms. But what kind of sustainable
communication strategy would AI agents themselves use if given
the chance to self-organise? In this short paper we summarise
our previous findings from [6], where we used an evolutionary
agent-based modelling approach to answer this question.

I. SUSTAINABLE KNOWLEDGE-SHARING ON THE WEB
Decentralised systems are built on the principle of agent-
agent communication and interoperation [2]. An important
issue is the sustainability of different communication strate-
gies.Indeed, looking back at the history of AI, all approaches
come with associated costs in terms of resources and mainte-
nance, from classical knowledge representation methods such
as ontologies [4] to latest machine learning ones [7].

If we were to deploy multi-agent systems on the Web,
one option would be to specify some ontology that
they
use to meaningfully communicate with each other. Regarding
ontology design and implementation, sustainability directly
relates to the strategies adopted in the multi-agent system using
the ontologies for its cooperation and communication. It also
depends on characteristics of the MAS itself e.g. in an open
MAS where any new agent can join the communication strate-
gies may be different from other more controlled systems.

Alternative agent-oriented communication protocols can dif-
fer in terms of software maintenance of agents and in terms
of costs incurred to store and share knowledge. At the two
extremes, the burden could be put either on the agents to align
their individual ontologies when they need to interact, or, at
the opposite end, on a shared ontology provider to ensure a
lingua franca. Each extreme has its costs and benefits and there
is a continuum of hybrid options in-between. For instance,
letting agents have their own ontologies means they will pay
the cost of aligning them when they have to communicate,
whereas maintaining a shared ontology comes with the price of
achieving consensus, commitment and versioning every time it
needs to be changed. But how sustainable would these different
strategies be from an economy of knowledge perspective?

In terms of economy of knowledge sharing, the Web can be
seen as an open MAS, where knowledge is mostly public but

can also be private or restricted to a group or even a couple
of users or agents (e.g. B2B interactions, intranets, etc.). We
can also say that Web agents that contribute to Wikipedia
are building a public good. The over-arching goals of Web
agents would be to share as much knowledge as necessary
to ensure they achieve their goals without disclosing their
entire knowledge base (there might be some knowledge that
needs to remain private). From an evolutionary perspective,
this search for interoperability makes Web agents compete
with each other, and assuming that the knowledge shared is
relevant, the agents with the fittest strategies are able to share
the most knowledge in the most efficient way possible.

We have known for decades that the diversity of resources
in modern infospheres such as the Web calls for artificial
ecosystems with a diversity of interacting agents ranging from
reactive to deliberative paradigms, maintaining the information
ecology [3] and supporting their hybrid communities in sus-
tainable ways [1]. However, improper ethical advancement of
AI could lead to unsustainable long-term side effects in knowl-
edge of information sharing systems. On one hand we have the
deployment of power-hungry protocols such as Blockchains.
On the other hand, there is the risk of self-interested agents
that wish to maximise the output of their knowledge sharing
goals and cause two main negative outcomes on the Infosphere
[5]. The first is caused by exploitation of resources, while the
second is caused by the pollution of resources. For example, a
Web agent might exploit the system it finds itself in (the Web
in this case) by producing redundant information, or by doing
so in conjunction with the exploitation of communication
channels with other agents.

their execution,

Information ecosystems are a multidimensional world where
the importance of agents,
the information
resources, the infrastructure, the communication, . . . must be
treated from the perspective of sustainability as a complex
self-organising system where every component has costs of
design, production, running and maintenance that their owners
may want to keep as low as possible.

II. METHOD & RESULTS

In “Interoperable AI: Evolutionary Race Towards Sustain-
able Knowledge Sharing” [6], we described a model simu-
lation to study the sustainability of different strategies for
cooperation in decentralized systems focusing on knowledge
sharing among agents in a MAS. We assumed that the cost

of knowledge sharing is greatly impacted by the strategies for
ontology-based communication being used by the agents.

We also assumed that Web agents want to be more sustain-
able and that they might compete with each other in finding
the most sustainable means to share knowledge. One way
to make self-interested agents more ‘sustainable’ would be
to allow them to optimise between the strategies that they
choose to share knowledge (and in some cases they would
inevitably share) and the cost of doing so in various contexts. If
these agents were able to choose between different knowledge
sharing strategies, and able to learn from their peers the costs
and benefits of these strategies, what strategy would they
choose?

To test the idea that “the more ambitious goal of a common
universal ontology is unlikely to be realized” [8], we have
formulated a set of research questions and hypotheses to
study the emergence on communication strategies in different
knowledge-sharing ecosystems. Our main research question
was: Does the choice of a common universal ontology emerge
as an evolutionary stable strategy in populations of self-
interested knowledge-sharing agents that learn from each other
through imitation?

We identified seven strategies that range from using indi-
vidual ontologies and translation services to using a common
ontology. These are: 1) using own language (O), 2) translation
(TR, 3) translation per knowledge (TR2), 4) using a common
language with exponential cost of maintenance (CL)), 5) using
a common language with a maintenance cost proportional to
the number of agents that use it (CL2), 6) a hybrid strategy
that uses a combination of TR and CL named (H), and 7) a
hybrid strategy that uses a combination of TR2 and CL2 (H2).
We implemented these strategies and performed extensive
simulations of evolutionary agent-based models. We tested
the strategies when interactions were non-voluntary (agents
had to participate in knowledge sharing) and voluntary where
agents could decide not to participate in knowledge sharing
by choosing the additional Loner strategy (L).

We found that, under the assumption of cooperation and
the possibility of decentralization, translation strategies are
more sustainable than shared ontology strategies for knowl-
edge sharing between autonomous agents, and that hybrid
strategies did not perform as well as expected. Figure 1a

shows that among the different strategies the translation per
knowledge strategy (TR2) is the most sustainable one. TR2
is the communication strategy that Web agents choose to pay
a cost for translating the knowledge that they wish to share
with other agents, but agents only pay for the translation of
knowledge that they do not understand, i.e., for the exact
pieces of knowledge for which they do not share exactly the
same ontologies. The effect of imitation in Figure 1b shows
us that agents with better strategy adoption/learning abilities
will choose TR2 more frequently than other agents.

As a concluding note, there is currently a lack of translation
services of this kind. As mentioned in the paper, we use
our results to motivate the deployment of translation-based
approaches for making knowledge-sharing in decentralised
systems more sustainable.
