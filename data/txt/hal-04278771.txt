Abstract: Mycosubtilin belongs to the family of lipopeptides. Different isoforms with various
antifungal activities can be obtained according to the length and the isomery of the fatty acid. In this
work, the activities of the mycosubtilin isoforms were ﬁrst studied against the pathogen Aspergillus
niger, revealing the high activity of the anteiso-C17 isoform. Modiﬁcation of the mycosubtilin isoform
patterns during cultures of the natural strain Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 was then investigated through
amino acid feeding experiments. In parallel, single-gene knockouts and single-gene overexpression,
leading to the overproduction of the anteiso-C15 fatty acid chains, were predicted using informatics
tools which provide logical reasoning with formal models of reaction networks. In this way, it was
in silico predicted that the single overexpression of the ilvA gene as well as the single knockout of the
codY gene may lead to the overproduction of anteiso-C15 fatty acid chains. For the ﬁrst time, it has
been demonstrated that overexpression of ilvA helps to enhance the furniture of odd anteiso fatty acids
leading to a favored mycosubtilin anteiso-C17 production pattern (+41%). Alternatively, a knock-out
codY mutant led to a higher furniture of even iso fatty acids, leading to a favored mycosubtilin iso-C16
production pattern (+180%). These results showed that increased selective synthesis of particular
isoforms of mycosubtilin through metabolic engineering is feasible, disclosing the interest of these
approaches for future development of lipopeptide-producing strains.

Lipopeptides are classiﬁed into three families: surfactins, fengycins (or plipastatins),
and iturins [1]. Among all these natural products, mycosubtilin is a hybrid polyketide
synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthase (PKS/NRPS) product which belongs to the iturin
family. This family also includes iturin A, AL, and C; bacillomycin D, F, L, and LC; and
bacillopeptin [2]. Mycosubtilin is a biosurfactant and a strong antifungal agent constituted
of a circular lipoheptapeptide with a β-amino fatty acid moiety (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Mycosubtilin anteiso-C17.

The combination of different fatty acid lengths, mainly C16 and C17, and multiple
isomeries (linear, iso, and anteiso) leads to different mycosubtilin isoforms, showing varying
biological activity. Mycosubtilins act as pore-forming agents that activate in situ phospho-
lipases and allow entering and disrupting the lipid bilayer by forming oligomers. These
oligomers consist of lipopeptide clusters, lipopeptide–phospholipids, or phospholipid–
sterols complexes [3]. The pores formed will gradually expand and then lead to the death
of the target cell through the leakage of potassium, intracellular nucleotides, proteins,
lipids, and polysaccharides [4,5]. The pore-forming mycosubtilin shows a wide antifungal
spectrum against Saccharomyces cerevisiae [6], Candida albicans, Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia pas-
toris, Cryptococcus neoformans [7], Candida krusei, Paecilomyces variotii, Byssocchlamys fulva [8],
Botrytis cinerea [9], Venturia inaequalis [10], Zymoseptoria tritici [11], and Bremia lactucae [12].
However, all of these studies have been performed with mixtures of mycosubtilin isoforms
produced by B. subtilis.

It has long been known that the composition of the peptide chain has an inﬂuence
on the antifungal activity of iturins [6,13]. To illustrate the signiﬁcance of the relationship
between speciﬁc primary structures and related biological activities [14], two-dimensional
NMR studies were performed with mycosubtilin [15] and iturin A [16]. Despite their
close-related primary peptidic structures which only differ by the inversion of two residues
in positions 6 and 7, D-Ser and L-Asn, these two compounds showed a completely different
molecular topology, resulting in different levels of biological activity. The impact of both
the length of the fatty acid chain and its isomery seems to be even more important than
that of the core peptide. Thus, the surfactant activity of iturins and the stability of the foam
is impacted by the length of the alkyl chain. Increasing the chain length (above C15) results
in lower bubble stability [17]. The nature of the fatty acid chain also plays an important
role in the antifungal activity of iturins. A study carried out on the effect of the chain’s
length and the isomery of iturin A showed that the antifungal activity was even higher
when the chain was longer [18]. It also appeared that the iturin A linear n-C16 isoform was
more active than the iso-C16 isoform. Another study on iturins showed that the anteiso-C17
isoform of mycosubtilin was the most active against the yeast C. albicans [7]. The activity
of different alkyl chains of mycosubtilin against B. cinerea was also studied. The minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of puriﬁed isoforms of mycosubtilin was determined and
the results showed that the anteiso-C17 isoform was the most active against B. cinerea
with a MIC of 8 µM, followed by the isoforms n-C16 and iso-C17 (MIC = 16 µM) and
iso-C16 (MIC = 32 µM) [9]. Moreover, bacillomycin L (and Lc) showed that the antifungal

The combination of different fatty acid lengths, mainly C16 and C17, and multiple isomeries (linear, iso, and anteiso) leads to different mycosubtilin isoforms, showing vary-ing biological activity.

activity increased with the length of the alkyl chain n-C16 ≥ n-C14 and iso-C16 ≥ iso-C14.
Furthermore, in this same study, the authors showed that the isomery was also important
as n-C16 was more active than iso-C16 [19].

To better understand how B. subtilis produces the different mycosubtilin isoforms,
the synthesis mechanism of mycosubtilins, which helps to incorporate the fatty acid moi-
ety, should be highlighted. Mycosubtilin synthesis is accomplished by the mycosubtilin
synthetase, a multifunctional hybrid type I PK synthetase/NRP synthetase (PKS/NRPS).
The operon encoding the mycosubtilin synthetase has been identiﬁed and sequenced in
B. subtilis ATCC 6633 [20]. This operon of 38 kb consists of four ORFs: fenF, mycA, mycB, and
mycC. The assembly line of the mycosubtilin synthetase directs the mycosubtilin formation
through a complex thiotemplate modular system. Each of the seven NRPS modules of the
mycosubtilin synthetase, distributed among MycA, MycB, and MycC subunits, are respon-
sible for the incorporation of a single amino acid. MycA presents unique features with
combining functional fatty-acid-activating PKS and NRPS modules. An intra-cellular fatty
acid is loaded by an acyl ligase (AL) domain onto acyl carrier protein (ACP1). The loading
of the acyl by (AL) does not depend on the length of carbon chain when it is included
between C10 and C16 [21]. Moreover, the lack of speciﬁcity of AL, FenF, and also AMT [22]
opens interesting combinatorial biosynthesis prospects for the development of more ac-
tive analogues [23]. However, no data are available yet on the in vivo speciﬁc loading of
ACP1 by AL with natural iso- or anteiso-branched fatty acids of B. subtilis. The synthesis
mechanism of the different mycosubtilin isoforms could, thus, depend on the intra-cellular
fatty acid pool. Particularly, the synthesis of anteiso-branched chain mycosubtilin, which
seems to be the most antifungal isoform [7], could depend on the anteiso-branched chain
fatty acids pool.

So far, the branched chain fatty acids in bacteria belonging to Bacillus genus are de
novo synthesized [24] using the branched chain α-keto acids coming from valine, leucine,
and isoleucine (Val, Leu, and Ile) as primer sources of even iso, odd iso, odd anteiso fatty
acids, and malonyl-CoA as the chain extender [25]. B. subtilis possesses branched chain
fatty acids of the iso and anteiso series as major acyl constituents of cellular lipids: odd
anteiso (43%), odd iso (29%), and even iso (15%). The branched chain amino acids (Val,
Leu, and Ile) are biosynthesized by several enzymes encoded by the gene ilvA and those
of the ilvB operon using threonine and pyruvate as precursors [26,27]. More speciﬁcally,
the ilvA gene codes for the threonine dehydratase, which catalyzes the ﬁrst step of the Ile
biosynthesis pathway [28]. During the biosynthesis of branched chain fatty acid, these
amino acids are ﬁrst degraded to α-keto-3-methylvalerate (Keta), α-ketoisovalerate (Ketb),
and α-ketoisocaproate (Ketc) by a branched chain amino acid transaminase (BCAT). These
intermediates are then converted to 2-methylbutyryl-CoA (MetButCoA), isobutyryl-CoA
(IsoButCoA), and isovaleryl-CoA (IsoValCoA), respectively, by the branched chain ketoacid
dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. These two groups of enzymes (BCAT and BCKD) are
encoded by the bkd operon (ptb, bcd, buk, lpdV, bkdAA, bkdAB, and bkdB) [29]. This metabolic
pathway is regulated by the three major transcriptomic regulators of B. subtilis, CodY
(the global regulator), TnrA (the nitrogen regulator), and CcpA (the carbon-activated
protein) [30]. The importance of this metabolic pathway in the production of Bacillus
lipopeptides has recently been studied. Coutte et al. (2015) has modelled this metabolic
pathway and its regulation in order to successfully predict the gene knock-out for the
overproduction of Leu and in ﬁne surfactin [27]. More recently, the same team has shown
that by modifying the catabolic pathways of branched chain amino acids, and particularly
by disrupting the lpdV gene, a strain derived from B. subtilis 168 preferentially produced
n-C14 surfactin [31], while an interruption of codY caused an overproduction of surfactin
and particularly of the [Val]7 C14 isoform. Other authors have shown that the inhibition
of bkdAA and bkdAB, two genes involved in the degradation of Leu and Val to fatty acids,
not only improved surfactin production, but also increased the proportion of C14 isoforms.
The mutant strain produced nearly 85% of this isoform compared to 25% obtained with
the parent strain [32]. Regarding the production of iturinic molecules, it has been shown,

using B. subtilis BD, BL, MS, IT, and NICIB 8872 strains, that supplying the culture medium
with exogenous Val, Leu, and Ile subsequently orientated the fatty acid synthesis toward
even iso, odd iso, and odd anteiso fatty acids, and favored the production of even iso, odd
iso, and odd anteiso lipopeptides [33]. These elements infer that the production pattern of
mycosubtilin isoforms could be modulated by targeting genes that modify the intracellular
branched fatty acid pool.

In this study, we ﬁrst investigated the activities of the different mycosubtilin isoforms
against the pathogen Aspergillus niger, revealing the high activity of the anteiso-C17 iso-
form. As branched chain amino acids are primer sources of branched chain fatty acids,
we compared then the production of mycosubtilin isoforms by B. subtilis ATCC 6633
with or without exogenous branched amino acid feeding. Finally, we developed parallel
approaches based on transcriptomic studies, as well as bioinformatic modelling and pre-
diction, to identify several target genes which could lead to the production of different
patterns of mycosubtilin. Evidence of the role of one chosen target gene in the enhanced
furniture of the fatty acid isoform was achieved, leading to a favored bioactive mycosubtilin
production pattern.

2. Results

The objectives of this work were ﬁrst to carry out the puriﬁcation of mycosubtilin
isoforms to investigate their antifungal activity against A. niger, which causes major prob-
lems in fruit and vegetable crops, particularly in the cultivation of Amaryllidaceae. Once the
most active isoform was identiﬁed, different overproduction strategies were implemented,
such as amino acid feeding, gene knock-out, or gene overexpression, to direct the Bacillus’s
metabolism through the production of this most active isoform.

2.1. Puriﬁcation and Determination of the Antifungal Activity of Mycosubtilin Isoforms

Mycosubtilin isoforms were produced by the B. subtilis BBG100 strain, using the over-
ﬂowing continuous culture (O-CC) process described by Guez et al. (2021) [34]. Figure S1
presents the annotated chromatogram obtained for a mixture of mycosubtilins composed
of: iso-C16 (26%), Gln3 C17 (1%), n-C16 (2%), anteiso-C17 (45%), and iso-C17 (23%). This
mixture was used for the chromatographic preparation of each individual mycosubtilin
isoform. MICs of the mixture and of each puriﬁed isoform were then determined against
A. niger, and compared with previously obtained results toward various fungi (Table 1).

Conﬁrming the results previously obtained by authors on the ascomycetes fungi
B. cinerea, the solution of mycosubtilin had a strong action against A. niger. The minimal
inhibitory concentrations of the mixture of mycosubtilins and individual puriﬁed myco-
subtilin isoforms showed that the mixture gave an equal effect compared to the individual
puriﬁed mycosubtilin isoforms. Indeed, the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin and the mix were
the most active against the fungus (MIC of 8 µM each), followed by the n-C16 and iso-C17
isoforms (MIC of 16 µM each), as well as the iso-C16 one (MIC of 32 µM). The anteiso-C17
mycosubtilin seems signiﬁcantly less active against C. albicans (32 µM). Taken together,
these results show that it could, therefore, be interesting to overproduce this anteiso-C17
isoform speciﬁcally, in order to facilitate the puriﬁcation step and the potential future use
of this compound as an antifungal agent.

2.2. Effect of Amino Acid Feeding during B. subtilis ATCC 6633 Cultures
2.2.1. Effect on Cellular Fatty Acids Pattern

The proportions of the different fatty acid isoforms were quantiﬁed by gas chromatog-
raphy in amino-acid-supplemented conditions (Figure 2). The addition of Leu to the culture
medium induced an increase in the odd iso fatty acids, such as iso-C15, which increased
from 8.62 to 31.59% and iso-C17 which increased from 6.54 to 17.06% compared to the
control. The even iso fatty acids show an increase, from 13.72 to 34.98% for iso-C16 and
4.16 to 19.26% for iso-C14, in the presence of Val. Finally, the addition of Ile leads to an
increase in anteiso fatty acids, from 49.91 to 59.40% for anteiso-C15 and from 13.12 to 33.07%
for anteiso-C17.

Figure 2. Fatty acid isoforms pattern of B. subtilis ATCC 6633 after 48 h of growth at 30 ◦C in modiﬁed
Landy medium buffered at pH 7.0 with MOPS 100 mM and supplied either with Leu, Val, or Ile at
2 g/L. Results are mean values and standard deviations of four independent experiments.

2.2.2. Effect on Mycosubtilin Pattern

The mycosubtilin production was measured after 48 h of growth. Mycosubtilin concen-
tration was above 55.0 ± 10.3 mg/L for the standard condition and was slightly higher for
the amino acids supplemented conditions: 66.1 ± 5.2 mg/L for Leu, 71.4 ± 5.4 mg/L for
Val, and 77.3 ± 7.6 mg/L for Ile. The growth of B. subtilis ATCC 6633 was comparable under
all the used conditions (data not shown). Supplementation of the modiﬁed Landy medium
with different amino acids had an impact on the diverse proportions of mycosubtilins
patterns (Figure 3). Branched amino acids showed different impacts on isomers production:
Val helped to obtain mainly mycosubtilin iso-C16, Leu helped to obtain mainly mycosubtilin
iso-C17, and Ile led to a highly selective anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin production pattern.

The ratio of anteiso on iso fatty acids to mycosubtilin isoforms was calculated. This
indicated the very signiﬁcant effect of the addition of Ile for the biosynthesis of anteiso fatty
acid as well as its clear impact on the production proﬁles of mycosubtilin. Indeed, the ratio
of FA anteiso/iso is 19.2 ± 3.4 and the ratio of mycosubtilin anteiso/iso is 12.3 ± 1.4.

Metabolites 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 23   these results show that it could, therefore, be interesting to overproduce this anteiso-C17 isoform specifically, in order to facilitate the purification step and the potential future use of this compound as an antifungal agent. 2.2. Effect of Amino Acid Feeding during B. subtilis ATCC 6633 Cultures 2.2.1.

The even iso fatty acids show an increase, from 13.72 to 34.98% for iso-C16 and 4.16 to 19.26% for iso-C14, in the presence of Val.

2.3. Identify Genetic Targets for Speciﬁc Production of Mycosubtilin Isoforms

A main objective of this work was the development of a metabolic engineering-like
strategy to direct the mycosubtilin synthesis selectively toward a chosen isoform. To
achieve this goal, two parallel and complementary approaches were developed. The ﬁrst
is based on a transcriptomics study of B. subtilis BBG100 in the presence or absence of
Ile in the medium. The second is based on bioinformatics modelling of the branched
chain amino acid metabolic pathway and the use of constraint programming to predict
potential genetic targets for overexpression or knockout, leading to an overproduction of
the anteiso-branched chain fatty acid.

2.3.1. Transcriptomic Study

The differential gene expression occurring during an overproduction of the anteiso-C17
mycosubtilin compared to a standard mycosubtilin production pattern was studied. As
yeast extract contains branched amino acids, it was retrieved from the modiﬁed culture
medium. Under these conditions, a loss of productivity in mycosubtilin was observed
by a 20-fold decrease in B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and a 5-fold decrease with its derivative
BBG100 (data not shown). The choice was, therefore, made to preferentially study B. subtilis
BBG100 transcriptomic response rather than a B. subtilis ATCC 6633 one, as B. subtilis
BBG100 guarantees a level of mycosubtilin production between 10 and 15 times higher
than that of ATCC 6633 [35]. The strain BBG100 was constructed from B. subtilis ATCC 6633
by replacing the native promoter of the mycosubtilin operon by a strong and constitutive
one [35]. Moreover, to intensify the mycosubtilin production, the culture medium was
buffered with 100 mM MOPS at pH 7.0 [34] and cultures were grown under conditions of
high oxygen limitation [36]. Finally, cultures of B. subtilis BBG100 were performed in the
culture medium supplemented with 2 g/L of Ile (test) or not (control).

Under these experimental conditions, the differential gene expression of the mycosub-
tilin overproducing strain BBG100 could be inspected. A DNA oligonucleotide microarray
analysis revealed differential level of expressions of transcripts involved in central metabolic
pathways linked to the selectivity of the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin biosynthesis. Samples
taken from cultures for transcriptome studies were collected early in order to gain access to
information on genetic regulations occurring early in growth (Figure 4). Data showed that,
in the presence of Ile in the medium, most of the early regulated gene and overexpressed
genes are involved in the metabolic pathway of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis

Results are mean values and standard deviations of four independent experiments. The ratio of anteiso on iso fatty acids to mycosubtilin isoforms was calculated. This indicated the very significant effect of the addition of Ile for the biosynthesis of anteiso fatty acid as well as its clear impact on the production profiles of mycosubtilin. Indeed, the ratio of FA anteiso/iso is 19.2 ± 3.4 and the ratio of mycosubtilin anteiso/iso is 12.3 ± 1.4. 2.3. Identify Genetic Targets for Specific Production of Mycosubtilin Isoforms A main objective of this work was the development of a metabolic engineering-like strategy to direct the mycosubtilin synthesis selectively toward a chosen isoform. To achieve this goal, two parallel and complementary approaches were developed. The first is based on a transcriptomics study of B. subtilis BBG100 in the presence or absence of Ile in the medium. The second is based on bioinformatics modelling of the branched chain amino acid metabolic pathway and the use of constraint programming to predict potential genetic targets for overexpression or knockout, leading to an overproduction of the an-teiso-branched chain fatty acid. 2.3.1. Transcriptomic Study The differential gene expression occurring during an overproduction of the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin compared to a standard mycosubtilin production pattern was studied. As yeast extract contains branched amino acids, it was retrieved from the modified culture medium. Under these conditions, a loss of productivity in mycosubtilin was observed by a 20-fold decrease in B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and a 5-fold decrease with its derivative BBG100 (data not shown). The choice was, therefore, made to preferentially study B. sub-tilis BBG100 transcriptomic response rather than a B. subtilis ATCC 6633 one, as B. subtilis BBG100 guarantees a level of mycosubtilin production between 10 and 15 times higher than that of ATCC 6633 [35]. The strain BBG100 was constructed from B. subtilis ATCC 6633 by replacing the native promoter of the mycosubtilin operon by a strong and consti-tutive one [35]. Moreover, to intensify the mycosubtilin production, the culture medium was buffered with 100 mM MOPS at pH 7.0 [34] and cultures were grown under condi-tions of high oxygen limitation [36]. Finally, cultures of B. subtilis BBG100 were performed in the culture medium supplemented with 2 g/L of Ile (test) or not (control). Under these experimental conditions, the differential gene expression of the myco-subtilin overproducing strain BBG100 could be inspected. A DNA oligonucleotide micro-array analysis revealed differential level of expressions of transcripts involved in central metabolic pathways linked to the selectivity of the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin biosynthesis.

2.3.2. Model-Based Prediction for the anteiso Fatty Acid Precursor Overproduction

To perform a bioinformatic prediction of the overproduction of anteiso-C17 mycosub-
tilin, the previously developed model of the branched chain amino acid metabolic pathway
was used [27]. This model was developed at the time to predict the genes knock-out and
the changes in input ﬂow required for the overproduction of Leu (Figure S2). In the present
work, this model was improved by taking advantage from the latest developments in the
ﬁeld. All the changes and simpliﬁcations made are described in detail in paragraph 4.4
of the Materials and Methods section. The prediction target of interest for anteiso-C17
mycosubtilin production is to increase the outﬂow to anteiso-C15 fatty acid biosynthesis.
So, the target is now: anteiso-C15 = ↑.

Running the version 0.6 of the BioComputing’s reaction network tool with this target
on the reaction network did not work well the ﬁrst time, for several reasons that are
described in detail in the Materials and Methods section, which led to the reﬁned feedback
network presented in Figure S4. Running the BioComputing’s tool again on the reaction
network from Figure S4 led to much more convincing predictions of reaction knockouts,
inﬂow changes, and gene overexpression, as described in Figure 5.

First predictions are linked to input ﬂows, i.e., an increase in the input ﬂow of Thr
and GTP is proposed. Second predictions propose the knock-out of several genes, in
particular those involved in reactions r15 (CodY biosynthesis), r16 (TnrA biosynthesis),
r46 (YbgE biosynthesis), and r47 (YwvA biosynthesis). Last predictions are linked to the
overexpression of genes and particularly for the reactions of r22 (IlvA biosynthesis), r3,
r4, r62 (expression of bcd-bkdL operon), and r47 (YwvA biosynthesis). Surprisingly, some
reactions are predicted in Up and Down; this is the case of reactions r15 (CodY biosynthesis)
and r46 (Ywva biosynthesis). All these predictions are discussed below. The two criteria
were followed to choose the target genes: (1) to choose a reaction directly impacting the
metabolic reactions; and (2) to choose of a reaction impacting the regulation of these
metabolic pathways. Thus, the overexpression of the ilvA gene (r22) and the interruption
of the codY gene (r15) were undertaken by genetic engineering to verify their impact on the
production of anteiso fatty acid and mycosubtilin anteiso-C17.

Data showed that, in the presence of Ile in the medium, most of the early regulated gene and overexpressed genes are involved in the metabolic pathway of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis and with a high expression of the ilvBHCleuABCD operon. In contrast, the ybgE gene coding for aminotransferase is under-expressed. Furthermore, from a reg-ulatory point of view, the global pleiotropic regulator codY is slightly under-expressed during growth in the presence of Ile, whereas abrB is overexpressed.  Figure 4.

The prediction target of interest for anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin production is to increase the outflow to anteiso-C15 fatty acid biosynthesis. So, the target is now: anteiso-C15 = . Running the version 0.6 of the BioComputing’s reaction network tool with this target on the reaction network did not work well the first time, for several reasons that are de-scribed in detail in the Materials and Methods section, which led to the refined feedback network presented in Figure S4.

2.4. Genetic Engineering of Predicted Gene Targets

From the above results, several genetic targets were identiﬁed as having a major
role in the modulation of the production of mycosubtilin isoforms. The overexpression
of ilvA (BBG133) and the knock-out of codY (BV12I37) were performed in the wild-type
strain. These strains were then cultured at 30 ◦C in modiﬁed Landy medium for 48 h. The
fatty acid isoforms were quantiﬁed by GC and the mycosubtilin concentration, as well as
isoforms by HPLC. The strains B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and BBG133 showed similar growths,
compared to BV12I37, which was slightly lowered (data not shown). The mycosubtilin
production measured after 48 h of growth was 55.0 ± 10.3 mg/L for B. subtilis ATCC 6633,
45.7 ± 1.3 mg/L for BV12I37, and 36.7 ± 18.1 mg/L for BBG133. The diverse isoform
proportions of fatty acids were quantiﬁed by GC (Figure 6) and the mycosubtilin proﬁle
was quantiﬁed by HPLC (Figure 7).

Results are mean values and standard deviations of two independent experiments.  The membrane fatty acids pattern of the B. subtilis BBG133 performed at 30 °C was widely dominated by odd-numbered branched chains in comparison with the profile of the wild-type ATCC 6633.

The main changes were observed for the anteiso-C15 whose relative amount raised from 44.6% to 56.7%, respectively, for ATCC 6633 to BBG133. Moreover, the results showed a selective anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin production pattern, and that the anteiso-C17 relative amount in-creased from 45.15% for ATCC 6633 to 63.6% for BBG133. The iso-C16 isoform represented only 11.7%.  In the mutant CodY−, fatty acid profiles were more directed on even-numbered branched chains. In fact, the anteiso-C15 and iso-C16 are equivalently proportional at 33.0% and 29.7%, respectively, and the third most common fatty acid is iso-C14, whose relative amount reaches 17% but represents just 7% for ATCC 6633 profile. The mycosubtilin pro-file is thus directed toward a selective iso-C16 (66.1%) pattern. 3. Discussion 3.1. Purification and Determination of the Antifungal Activity of Mycosubtilin Isoforms Mycosubtilin is a lipopeptide with a large antifungal spectrum against phytopatho-gens, foodborne pathogens, and food spoilage [1,2,8]. Its antifungal activity is the most important among the iturinic lipopeptides, such as bacillomycin L, bacillomycin F, bacil-lomycin D, and iturin A [37]. The different mycosubtilin isoforms, composed of different fatty acid length and multiple isomery, presented various biological activities, selective antifungal activities, or biosurfactant activities. Many studies were performed with mix-tures of mycosubtilin isoforms produced by B. subtilis. In this work, each major mycosub-tilin isoform was purified in order to test its antifungal activity on a food spoilage micro-organism, A. niger. Our findings showed that the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin is the most interesting iso-form due to its high activity (MIC = 8 μM) against A. niger, at the same level as against B. cinerea [9]. Its activity is even higher than the one of the iso-C17 mycosubtilin (MIC = 16 μM), showing the importance of the isomery of the fatty acid moiety. Another result is that the higher activity of mycosubtilin iso-C17 compared to the one of the iso-C16 isoform is in line with the study carried out previously on iturin A, showing that the antifungal activity is even higher when the chain is longer [18]. The differences of MIC values ob-tained for A. niger compared to those previously obtained for C. albicans could be ex-plained by the main differences in the composition of the membrane composition of these microorganisms [38,39].   020406080100isoC16nC16anteisoC17isoC17Percentage of mycosubtilin isoforms (%)Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

The membrane fatty acids pattern of the B. subtilis BBG133 performed at 30 ◦C was
widely dominated by odd-numbered branched chains in comparison with the proﬁle
of the wild-type ATCC 6633. The predominant fatty acid was anteiso-C15, whereas the
anteiso-C17 and the iso-C16 were, respectively, the second and third common fatty acids.
The main changes were observed for the anteiso-C15 whose relative amount raised from
44.6% to 56.7%, respectively, for ATCC 6633 to BBG133. Moreover, the results showed a
selective anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin production pattern, and that the anteiso-C17 relative
amount increased from 45.15% for ATCC 6633 to 63.6% for BBG133. The iso-C16 isoform
represented only 11.7%.

In the mutant CodY−, fatty acid proﬁles were more directed on even-numbered
branched chains. In fact, the anteiso-C15 and iso-C16 are equivalently proportional at 33.0%
and 29.7%, respectively, and the third most common fatty acid is iso-C14, whose relative
amount reaches 17% but represents just 7% for ATCC 6633 proﬁle. The mycosubtilin proﬁle
is thus directed toward a selective iso-C16 (66.1%) pattern.

3. Discussion
3.1. Puriﬁcation and Determination of the Antifungal Activity of Mycosubtilin Isoforms

Mycosubtilin is a lipopeptide with a large antifungal spectrum against phytopathogens,
foodborne pathogens, and food spoilage [1,2,8]. Its antifungal activity is the most important
among the iturinic lipopeptides, such as bacillomycin L, bacillomycin F, bacillomycin D,
and iturin A [37]. The different mycosubtilin isoforms, composed of different fatty acid
length and multiple isomery, presented various biological activities, selective antifungal
activities, or biosurfactant activities. Many studies were performed with mixtures of myco-
subtilin isoforms produced by B. subtilis. In this work, each major mycosubtilin isoform was
puriﬁed in order to test its antifungal activity on a food spoilage microorganism, A. niger.
Our findings showed that the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin is the most interesting isoform
due to its high activity (MIC = 8 µM) against A. niger, at the same level as against B. cinerea [9].
Its activity is even higher than the one of the iso-C17 mycosubtilin (MIC = 16 µM), showing
the importance of the isomery of the fatty acid moiety. Another result is that the higher
activity of mycosubtilin iso-C17 compared to the one of the iso-C16 isoform is in line with the
study carried out previously on iturin A, showing that the antifungal activity is even higher
when the chain is longer [18]. The differences of MIC values obtained for A. niger compared
to those previously obtained for C. albicans could be explained by the main differences in
the composition of the membrane composition of these microorganisms [38,39].

3.2. Effect of Amino Acid Feeding during B. subtilis ATCC 6633 Cultures

In order to increase the biosynthesis of one speciﬁc mycosubtilin isoform, a ﬁrst
approach of feeding experiments with branched chain amino acids, i.e., precursors of fatty
acids, was performed.

The results presented in Figure 2; Figure 3 show that the supply in Val favors the
biosynthesis of even fatty acid, which then results in a high production of mycosubtilin
C16 isoform. In contrast, Leu and Ile lead to an increase in odd fatty acids (C15 and C17),
specially the anteiso form for the supply with Ile and, thus, a highly selective anteiso-C17
mycosubtilin production pattern. Ile is the precursor of odd-branched fatty acids [25,27].
These results were in accordance with those obtained previously by other authors [7] who
used Ile as a nitrogen source for the speciﬁc production of anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin. For-
merly, changes in the proportions of counterparts bacillomycin F and L have been obtained
by replacing only the Landy source of nitrogen by other amino acids [33]. Besson et al.
studied the proportions of β-hydroxy fatty acid incorporated into a lipopeptidic compound
according to different conditions of addition of amino acids (Leu, Ile and Val) in different
strains of the B. subtilis-producing iturinic compound [33]. They reported that during
the biosynthesis of this lipopeptide, the presence of Val could increase the proportion
of even iso β-hydroxy fatty acid, the presence of Ile of anteiso odd β-hydroxy fatty acid
(especially counterpart C15), and the presence of Leu of iso odd β-hydroxy fatty acid [33].

Similar work was carried out by these authors, based on the incorporation of radioactive
sodium acetate into fatty acids, who attempted to elucidate the biosynthesis mechanism in
iturin-producing B. subtilis [40].

3.3. Modiﬁcation of the Selective Synthesis of anteiso-C17 and iso-C16 Mycosubtilin Isoforms

As shown in this work, the modiﬁcation of the cellular fatty acid’s patterns observed
with B. subtilis mutants BBG133 (IlvA+) and BV12I37 (CodY−), compared to the reference
strain B. subtilis ATCC 6633, helps to modify the mycosubtilin isoform patterns. The
anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin production increased from 45.1% for ATCC 6633 to 63.6% for
BBG133 (IlvA+), whereas the iso-C16 mycosubtilin production increased from 23.6% for
ATCC 6633 to 66.1% for BV12I37 (CodY−). These results infer that the production pattern
of the different mycosubtilin isoforms is directly linked to the cellular fatty acid pool.
Previous results showed the in vitro lack of speciﬁcity of the fatty acid loading domain
(AL) of the mycosubtilin synthetase. Indeed, the loading of the acyl by (AL) does not seem
to depend on the length of the carbon chain when it was comprised between C10 and
C16 [21]. The present work demonstrates that the in vivo loading of fatty acids again shows
its tolerance; this time, there was tolerance for the loading of different fatty acid isoforms,
including natural iso or anteiso-branched, which could lead to interesting combinatorial
biosynthesis prospects.

3.4. Identifying Genetic Targets to Increase the Speciﬁc Production of Mycosubtilin Isoforms

The biosynthetic pathways of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) in B. subtilis are
well known and previously modelized [27]. The genetic loci involved are mainly ilvBH-
CleuABCD, ilvA, ilvD, ybgE, and ywaA [26]. All of these genes or operons are repressed
under amino-acid-rich conditions by the activity of the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator
CodY [41–43]. Val and Ile are positive effectors of CodY, such that BCAA biosynthesis is
negatively autoregulated at relatively low BCAA concentrations [41]. In B. subtilis, CodY
controls the expression of a several transcriptional units. The presence of Ile, Val, and Leu
in the growth medium is essential to obtain both high activity and efﬁcient regulation of
target genes [44]. This metabolic pathway is at the heart of the production of branched
chain amino acids, but also of branched chain fatty acids, and is therefore of great interest
when one wishes to modify the speciﬁc production of lipopeptide isoforms.

In this work, a complementary approach was used to identify potential gene target
to be modiﬁed in order to produce more speciﬁcally different mycosubtilin isoforms, i.e.,
anteiso-C17 and also iso-C16. This approach combined a transcriptomic study in the presence
of Ile (an amino acid well identiﬁed as a precursor of anteiso fatty acids) and a bioinformatics
prediction using a previously developed model of the BCAA pathway [27,45]. The results
of this approach allowed us to identify several targets genes.

The results of microarray presented in Figure 4 show that in the presence of Ile in
the medium, the ilvBHCleuABCD is the main operon overexpressed. Nevertheless, the
gene ilvA which is also directly involved in the metabolic pathway of Ile production, did
not show up in the transcriptomic analysis. This result seems quite coherent because this
analysis was carried out in the presence of an excess of Ile in the medium, so that the cells
seem to counterbalance their metabolism towards the production of Leu and Val [41]. The
addition of Ile in the culture medium led to the repression of ybgE, which codes for an
aminotransferase involved in the BCAA metabolism. Its repression should physiologically
result in the limitation of the synthesis of BCAA. As the growth of the microorganism was
normal in the presence of Ile, it was assumed that the cellular pool of Leu and Val needed
for cellular growth was not affected. A hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that
the cell could counterbalance the ybgE repression by overexpressing the ilvBHCleuABCD
operon and the leuS gene, as shown in the results section of this work. It should be noticed
that ywaA, which is an isologue of ybgE [46], is not repressed in the presence of Ile, which is
not critical because of the low enzymatic activity of YwaA compared to YbgE [47].

It is known that several regulators (AbrB and CodY) and environmental factors are
implied in the biosynthesis of lipopeptides. The transcriptomic results show that, in the
presence of Ile, the codY gene is slightly under-expressed (Figure 4). The under-expression
of codY in the presence of BCAA in the medium was effectively shown by authors [41,42].
The over-expression of the transcriptomic regulator AbrB, which is known to negatively
regulate the expression of the mycosubtilin operon [48], was also observed.

In this work, the over-expression of abrB was observed, while comK was repressed. This
concomitant differential expression is consistent with previous results. It was indeed shown
that the binding of AbrB at position −35 of the comK promoter repressed its expression [49].
This result is also consistent with those obtained in the presence of casamino acids [50].
The concomitant over-expression of abrB and under-expression of codY is more difﬁcult
to explain. Indeed, CodY and AbrB normally act together, for example to repress the
expression of comK [49]. Our results suggest a reasonably complex mechanism that ﬁne-
tunes and regulates the metabolic activity of B. subtilis ATCC 6633 when grown in the
presence of Ile to promote the synthesis of mycosubtilin anteiso-C17.

Prediction results from bioinformatics modelling revealed numerous targets for ge-
netic optimization and speciﬁc mycosubtilin isoform production, as presented in Figure 5.
Among these, the overproduction of the ilvA gene (r22) was predicted. This prediction
was then tested in vivo by genetically modifying B. subtilis ATCC 6633. The overexpression
of the ilvA gene strengthens the conversion of Thr to AkB by reaction 41. Concomitantly,
the outﬂow of Thr (out-thr) was weakened. If this outﬂow was absent, all Thr would
be converted to AkB in any steady state, so strengthening r41 would have only a short
time effect, but not effect in the steady states. Hence, the prediction r22 = ↑ would not be
made. This shows that adding the outﬂow of Thr to the model was indeed relevant for the
predictions. As shown in Figure 7, the overexpression of ilvA had the expected effects on
the speciﬁc production of the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin isoform.

From a bioinformatics point of view, it was also veriﬁed that all predictions were exact
in the sense of [51], which intuitively means that the global reasoning on metabolic loops
computes the abstraction perfectly without any over-approximation. It is closely related to
the notion of completeness of abstract interpretation. To obtain the most precise result, a
recent algorithm for exact prediction was added into the biocomputing reaction network
tool developed previously [27,50].

Analysis of the predictions reveal that some reactions are both predicted for single
overexpression and single knockouts, for instance reaction r15 (CodY biosynthesis) and r47
(YwvA biosynthesis). This means that they have both a positive and a negative effect on
the target. One cannot know which effect is dominating without additional knowledge on
the kinetics of the reactions. This double prediction is speciﬁcally explained by the multiple
involvement of CodY in this complex metabolic pathway [41]. codY deletion was also
undertaken in vivo. This time, the result obtained is not the one expected, and a signiﬁcant
change in the mycosubtilin pattern is indeed observed after the deletion of codY, but the
isoform iso-C16 is favored. This result can be explained by several reasons. First of all, in
this metabolic pathway, the deletion of codY will certainly lead to a change in the expression
of ilvA (r22), ilvD (r25) genes, ilv-leu operon (r2), and the bkd operon (r11), but also in the
expression of ybgE (r46). The analysis of the bioinformatic model helps to explain this result
by listing the paths in the graph on which a codY knockout can inﬂuence the synthesis of
the anteiso-C15 + C17 fatty acid and also the iso-C14 + C16 fatty acid. Experiments showed
that overexpression of the ilvA gene (r22 = Up) is positive for the target anteiso-C15 + C17
fatty acid synthesis. However, the effects on r11 = Up (bkd operon) in practice are not
known. In the model, the bkd operon has a positive inﬂuence on both anteiso-C15 + C17
fatty acid synthesis and iso-C14 + C16 fatty acid synthesis, but these two effects cannot be
distinguished. The effect of r46 = Up (ybgE) is not clearly deﬁned. In the model, it has a
negative effect on both the synthesis of anteiso-C15 + C17 fatty acids and the synthesis of
iso-C14 + C16 fatty acids. From a metabolic point of view, it seems certain that the effect of
codY deletion leads to the overproduction of the Leu and Val amino acids, as expected. This

Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

13 of 22

is the same result observed by Brinsmade et al. (2010) [30] where the deletion of codY led
to an overproduction of Val by a factor of 6. These amino acids will then be transformed
preferably into iso-branched fatty acids and, in particular, into even-numbered fatty acids
coming from the degradation of Val. This result is consistent with the one obtained on
the production of surfactin, where the deletion of codY favored the biosynthesis of the
surfactin Val7 C14 isoform [31]. Other predictions that were made included the knock-out
of tnrA and ybgE. The deletion of an important regulator, such as TnrA, was expected by
the known negative impact of TnrA on the promoter of the ilv-leu operon, but also on the
promoter of the bkd operon [29,52]. It was notably shown that the expression of the bkd
operon was three times higher in a mutant deleted for tnrA. It should be noted that the tnrA
target did not emerge from the microarray analysis in the presence of Ile, which conﬁrms
the result obtained by Debarbouille et al. (1999) who did not observe any change in the
expression of this gene in the presence of 20 mM Ile [29]. The modulation of ybgE expression
is also an interesting target because this gene also emerges from the microarray analysis.
Moreover, Cai et al. (2020) also showed that BCAA supply modules may play a role in
the production of bacitracin in B. licheniformis [53]. In this bacterium, BCAA synthesis
pathways were enhanced by the simultaneous overexpression of the acetolactate synthase
IlvBNfbr, the 2-isopropylmalate synthase LeuAfbr, and the BCAA aminotransferase YbgE.
In addition, permeases were identiﬁed as importers of BCAA, and their overexpression
enhanced intracellular BCAA accumulations and bacitracin yields [53]. This approach to
BCAA-speciﬁc permeases would also be interesting to conduct in B. subtilis ATCC 6633
with the objective of improving the production of mycosubtilin isoforms.

Concerning the other predictions and, in particular, the overexpression of the bkd
operon (r3, r4, and r62) and the ywvA gene, these predictions seem logical because these
genes code for enzymes are directly involved in the degradation of BCAAs and, thus, in
the biosynthesis of branched chain fatty acids. However, in a recent study on surfactin,
the authors showed that overexpression of the bkd operon led to a negative impact on the
growth of the strain but also to a signiﬁcant reduction in surfactin production. Interestingly,
this genetic modiﬁcation was coupled with others, such as the overexpression of the ilv-leu
operon and the lipALM operon (lipoic acid biosynthesis) [54]. This highlights the value of
multiple genetic modiﬁcations in metabolic engineering strategies.

In view of these known effects of modifying these single targets, it would be appropri-
ate to try a multiple knock-out or mixed knock-out strategy, as well as an overexpression
strategy, as has already been undertaken, for example, to increase surfactin synthesis in
B. subtilis [54]. From a bioinformatics point of view, we also checked that there are no
double changes that could satisfy the target containing no predicted single changes. Never-
theless, multiple changes may be reasonable, as the effects may add up. In addition, it may
be useful to perform knockouts that disable feedback loops, as one cannot infer from the
model what their effect might be without additional kinetic information.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Strains and Growth Conditions

B. subtilis ATCC 6633 is a natural isolate producing two lipopeptides, i.e., mycosubtilin
and surfactin. All the B. subtilis strains used in this study were derivatives from B. subtilis
ATCC 6633 (Table 2). All strains were stored at −80 ◦C in 40% (v/v) glycerol.

The preculture was completed in a modiﬁed Clark medium [55], composed as fol-
lows: glucose, 20 g/L; KH2PO4, 2.7 g/L; K2HPO4, 18.9 g/L; yeast extract, 0.5 g/L; EDTA,
0.05 g/L; MgSO4, 0.61 g/L; MnSO4, 0.056 g/L; NaCl, 0.1 g/L; CaCl2, 0.012 g/L; ZnSO4,
0.018 g/L; FeSO4, 0.018 g/L; CuSO4, 0.002 g/L; Na2MoO4, 0.001 g/L; H3BO3, 0.001 g/L;
Na2SO3, 0.001 g/L; NiCl2, 0.0037 g/L; NH4NO3, 4 g/L; and MgSO4, 1 g/L. Cells were then
transferred to conical ﬂasks of 500 mL at an initial biomass concentration of 0.08 g(D.W)/L,
corresponding to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.25. The ﬁlling volume of culture medium
in the conical ﬂasks was 100 mL. By using this ﬁlling volume ratio (0.2), at a shaking speed
of 160 rpm and a shaking diameter of 50 mm, the oxygen transfer conditions were limited

Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

14 of 22

to 8 mmol O2/L/h, allowing an optimization of the mycosubtilin productivity, as shown
previously by authors [36]. The cells were cultured in Erlenmeyer ﬂasks at 30 ◦C, at least
in triplicate, and mean values and standard deviations were calculated. For the cultures
of the different mutants used in this work, a modiﬁed Landy medium was composed
as follows: glucose, 20 g/L; (NH4)2SO4, 2.3 g/L; K2HPO4, 1 g/L; MgSO4, 0.5 g/L; KCl,
0.5 g/L; CuSO4, 1.6 mg/L; Fe2(SO4)3, 1.2 mg/L; MnSO4, 0.4 mg/L; and yeast extract,
1 g/L. For amino acids testing and transcriptomic experiments, the previous medium
was modiﬁed with retrieving the yeast extract. Culture media were buffered with MOPS
(3-(N-morpholino)propanesulphonic acid) at 100 mM at pH 7.0 to favor the synthesis of
mycosubtilins [34].

4.2. Mutants of B. subtilis ATCC 6633 Used in This Study

Three different mutants from the wild-type strain B. subtilis ATCC 6633 were con-
structed or used in this work. The ﬁrst one, namely B. subtilis BBG100, was obtained in a
previous study [35] by replacing the promoter of the mycosubtilin synthase (mycA) operon
by a strong and constitutive one, i.e., PrepU originating from the repU gene of Staphylococcus
aureus plasmid pUB110 [56]. The second one, namely B. subtilis BVI2I33, contains a deletion
of the codY gene, the construction of which has already been described [48].

The third one is an overexpressing ilvA mutant strain, namely B. subtilis BBG133, which
was constructed from the mutant RFB102, a competent strain from wild-type B. subtilis
ATCC 6633 [7], by replacing the native promoter of the ilvA gene by a constitutive one
PrepU. Brieﬂy, part of the ilvA gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using ilvA-fwd and ilvA-rev
primers (See Table S1); this fragment was then puriﬁed and ligated in pGEM-T easy vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) generating the plasmid pBG142. This plasmid was then used
to transform E. coli JM109. The plasmid pBEST501 was digested by XbaI and PstI, generating
a fragment containing PrepU-neo. The plasmid pBG142 was digested by BcuI and Mph1103I
generating a long fragment of 4267 bp containing the gene ilvA. This longer fragment and
the fragment PrepU-neo from pBEST501 were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase (Takara,
Shiga, Japan), leading to a new plasmid pBG154, which was used to transform E. coli JM109.
The plasmid pBG154 was then ampliﬁed using TempliPhi technology (Cytiva, Malborough,
MA, USA) prior to its use for the transformation of RFB102. The transformation of RFB102
with pBG154 was performed using natural competence protocol [57]. Transformation
experiments with B. subtilis RFB102 and pBG154 led to isolation of one sole colony. The
resulting strain of B. subtilis was named BBG133. Genomic DNAs of both this clone and the
wild-type strain were puriﬁed. Replacement of the natural promoter by the constitutive
promoter PrepU associated with the neo gene was demonstrated by PCR ampliﬁcation of
genomic DNA with the PrepU-fwd and ilvA2-rev primers. A 1.9 kb fragment was obtained

Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

instead of nothing with the wild type (data not shown). Strains and plasmid used in this
study are presented in Table 2.

4.3. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription and Microarrays

A volume corresponding to 1 × 109 cells of B. subtilis ATCC 6633 was promptly
sampled and mixed thoroughly with the Ambion Ribopure RNA latter solution (v/v). The
RNA isolation step was performed speciﬁcally for this strain, as described by authors [58].
For microarray assays, the reverse transcription and the cDNA labelling were realized
following the protocol described previously [59]. Fluorescently labeled probes were then
hybridized to 4096 open reading frame (ORF) microarray slides prepared from B. subtilis
strain 168 (Eurogentec, Belgium). Microarray hybridization was performed with 10 µg of
cDNA with a Discovery Ventana (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA). Images were analyzed using
GenePix Pro 6 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA, USA). Spots whose intensity was
close to that of the local background or whose circularity or homogeneity was insufﬁcient
were excluded. Data were smoothed by local-weighted smoothing scatterplot (LOWESS)
and the consistency of the ﬂip-dye was veriﬁed. Spots whose value was between ±2 of the
mean value of the distribution of spot values (slice analysis), or spots that were not present
in the form of duplicates, were excluded. At the end, genes involved in metabolic pathways
were considered to be differentially expressed if they displayed ≥2-fold changes and a
p-value < 0.05. For genes coding for regulators, the differential expression was considered
for ≥1.6-fold changes. For the codY gene, a speciﬁc wrapper-based gene selection technique
was applied (bootstrap classiﬁcation combined to variance analysis). Array data are
available in the Supplementary Material Figure S2.

4.4. Model-Based Change Prediction for the Anteiso Fatty Acid Precurssor Overproduction

In order to predict by bioinformatic gene knock-out or gene overexpression, the
reaction network model of the metabolic pathway of the branched chain amino acids leucine
(Leu), valine (Val), and isoleucine (Ile) from threonine (Thr) and pyruvate (Pyr) in B. subtilis
was used. This model was ﬁrst presented in [27] when studying the overproduction of Leu,
demonstrating that it is a crucial precursor of surfactin. This reaction network is shown
in Figure S2. For the prediction of gene knockouts that may lead to Leu overproduction,
a biocomputing reaction network tool was applied [49]. With the target out-Leu = ↑, the
tool produced the predictions presented in Figure S3, where r = ⇓ stood for the prediction
of the knockout of reaction r. The tool ran the prediction algorithm for reaction networks
with partial kinetic information from [43], based on abstract interpretation. The idea was
to abstract change between real values in the steady states to symbols, such as ↑ for an
increase, Do for a decrease, and ⇓ for a decrease to 0. The possible changes for knockout
predictions were reaction knockouts r = ⇓. The tool, however, could also predict increase
inﬂows of a species S, that is in-S = ↑, and decreases of inﬂows in-S = ↓. Such predictions
meant that changes of the experimental environment, or of adjacent reaction networks,
may lead to the target.

Abstract interpretation enables local reasoning in the graph of the network graph.
Local reasoning alone, however, is problematic for graphs with loops. In this case, it may
lead to a large over-approximation, such as predicting changes which may not lead to the
target. The original algorithm of the BioComputing’s tool, therefore, used heuristics based
on rewritten rules for difference constraints [43] to reduce the over-approximation in the
presence of loops. Meanwhile, an exact treatment of loops in the metabolic part of the
network was developed [49], which relies on the usage of elementary ﬂux modes (EFMs).
For instance, the EFMs of the reaction network in Figure S3 are shown in Figure 8. The dark
gray and black EFMs show that inﬂowing of Pyr can be used in the production of Leu and
Val, respectively. The yellow EFMs show that Thr is needed for the production of Ile too,
concomitantly with Pyr. The usage of EFMs helps to add nontrivial global reasoning power
based on metabolic loops that is essential for precise predictions. Feedback loops through
the regulatory control network, however, remain problematic, as will be analyzed hereafter.

Figure 8. Elementary ﬂux modes (EFMs) of the metabolic subnetwork of the reaction network in
Figure S3. The dark gray ﬂux mode show that inﬂow Pyr can be used to produce outﬂowing Leu. The
black ﬂux mode shows that Pyr can also be used to produce outﬂowing Val. Furthermore, the yellow
ﬂux mode shows that inﬂowing Pyr contributes to the production of Ile but only concomitantly with
inﬂowing Thr.

To produce the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin isoform, an increase in the outﬂow of MetBut-
CoA into the FA biosynthesis of anteiso-C15 fatty acid is required. MetBut-CoA can, for
instance, be produced from Ile. The reaction network in Figure S2 collapses MetBut-CoA
with IsoBut-CoA and IsoVal-CoA into a single species called Acyl-CoA. So, in our previous
model, one cannot distinguish the outﬂow of MetBut-CoA towards the wanted fatty acid
chain, in particular anteiso-C15, from the outﬂows of IsoBut-CoA (coming from Val) toward
the FA biosynthesis of iso-C14 and iso-C16 and the outﬂow of IsoVal-CoA (coming from Leu)
to the FA bio-synthesis of iso-C13 and iso-C15. Therefore, the reaction network was modiﬁed
in the present work to adapt the reaction network from Figure S2, so that it splits Acyl-CoA
into species MetBut-CoA, IsoBut-CoA, and IsoVal-CoA. This is the ﬁrst step leading from
the reaction network presented in Figure S2 to that presented in Figure S3 (Figure 8).

Further improvements to the reaction network described below are shown in Figure S4.
This ﬁgure contains some more important changes compared to Figure S2, not only the split
of Acyl-CoA. In particular, new outﬂows for Thr and Pyr to the protein and other amino
acids or primary metabolites synthesis were added. Biologically, this was justiﬁed since

Metabolites 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 23    Figure 8. Elementary flux modes (EFMs) of the metabolic subnetwork of the reaction network in Figure S3. The dark gray flux mode show that inflow Pyr can be used to produce outflowing Leu. The black flux mode shows that Pyr can also be used to produce outflowing Val. Furthermore, the yellow flux mode shows that inflowing Pyr contributes to the production of Ile but only concomi-tantly with inflowing Thr.  To produce the anteiso-C17 mycosubtilin isoform, an increase in the outflow of Met-But-CoA into the FA biosynthesis of anteiso-C15 fatty acid is required. MetBut-CoA can, for instance, be produced from Ile. The reaction network in Figure S2 collapses MetBut-CoA with IsoBut-CoA and IsoVal-CoA into a single species called Acyl-CoA. So, in our previous model, one cannot distinguish the outflow of MetBut-CoA towards the wanted fatty acid chain, in particular anteiso-C15, from the outflows of IsoBut-CoA (coming from Val) toward the FA biosynthesis of iso-C14 and iso-C16 and the outflow of IsoVal-CoA (coming from Leu) to the FA bio-synthesis of iso-C13 and iso-C15. Therefore, the reaction network was modified in the present work to adapt the reaction network from Figure S2, so that it splits Acyl-CoA into species MetBut-CoA, IsoBut-CoA, and IsoVal-CoA. This is the first step leading from the reaction network presented in Figure S2 to that presented in Figure S3 (Figure 8). Further improvements to the reaction network described below are shown in Figure S4. This figure contains some more important changes compared to Figure S2, not only the split of Acyl-CoA. In particular, new outflows for Thr and Pyr to the protein and other amino acids or primary metabolites synthesis were added. Biologically, this was justified since these amino acids can also be used in the production of proteins during gene expres-sion elsewhere. This adds the green EFM moving inflowing Thr to its new outflow, and Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

17 of 22

these amino acids can also be used in the production of proteins during gene expression
elsewhere. This adds the green EFM moving inﬂowing Thr to its new outﬂow, and the light
blue EFM moving inﬂowing Pyr to its new outﬂow (Figure 8). Change predictions that
lead to over-activating these EFMs will turn out particularly relevant later on. Furthermore,
some other simpliﬁcations were performed. First, the species glutamic acid (Glu) and oxog-
lutarate (OxoGlu) were removed. The main reason was that only carbon (C) was of interest,
not azote (N). Second, the reactions 12 and 13 were revised since the changes of 12 and 13
were the same biologically. This led us to the reactions 62 and 63. Finally, an algorithm
was also improved to not only predict gene knockouts but also gene overexpression. For
this, however, the biocomputing reaction network tool was extended with the ability to
overexpress candidate genes.

After all these modiﬁcations, the use of the BioComputing’s reaction network tool on
the reaction network did not work well the ﬁrst time, for several reasons. The ﬁrst problem
was that the addition of the outﬂows out-Thr and out-Pyr increased the computation time,
so that only few predictions could be observed after some hours. Some results could be
only obtained in reasonable computation time when the outﬂows were removed again, as
presented in Figure S2. The second problem was that a large number of predictions was
made, as shown in Figure S3, some of which do not seem to be relevant and cannot be
justiﬁed biologically, especially as most of them are common to the previous predictions
made with Leu = ↑ as the target [27]. As a result, it was difﬁcult to determine whether
these were false positives or not from a biological or bioinformatic point of view. It turned
out that the unexpected predictions were spontaneous over approximations. It was then
noticed that these over-approximations were related to feedback loops through network
regulation. However, with the currently available algorithms, it was not possible to dispose
of these over approximations. Therefore, a decision was made to remove the regulatory
feedback loops, even if they were biologically justiﬁed, resulting in the reaction network
presented in Figure S4.

The reﬁned reaction network was then used to predict the overproduction of odd
anteiso fatty acids (Figure 5). When these predictions were launched, a ﬁnal problem was
detected, related to the very high computation time of the solver used by the BioCom-
puting’s reaction network tool. This raised serious difﬁculties when adding the outﬂows
out-Thr and out-Pyr in particular, as presented above. The reason for this problem was
linked to the search strategy chosen by the solver. Once the search strategy was improved,
single changes in Figure 5 were predicted in a few seconds.

4.5. Lipopeptide HPLC Analysis

Samples of B. subtilis cultures were centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min. A volume
of 1 mL of the supernatant was puriﬁed through C18 Maxi-Clean cartridges 1 g (Alltech,
Deerﬁeld, IL, USA). The column was washed with 8 mL of water. The lipopeptides were
then eluted with 8 mL of 100% methanol (HPLC grade, Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium).
The extract was dried before dissolution in 200 µL of methanol. The sample was then
injected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (Online Degaser, 717
Autosampler, 660S Controller, 626 Pump, 996 PhotoDiodeArray, Waters Corp., Milford,
MA, USA) using a C18 column (5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm, 218 TP, VYDAC). The mycosubtilins
were separated with an acetonitrile/water/triﬂuoroacetic acid solvent, 40:60:0.1, v/v/v.
The ﬂow rate was 1 mL/min and the detection wavelength was 214 nm. Puriﬁed iturin
A and surfactin A, used as standards, were from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MI,
USA). The retention time and second derivative of the absorption spectrum between 200
and 400 nm (Diode Array PDA 996, Waters) were used to identify the eluted molecules
(Millenium 32 Software, Waters).

4.6. Lipopeptide Preparation

A volume of 10 mL of the culture supernatants was puriﬁed through C18 Maxi-Clean
10 g cartridges (Alltech). Compared to the lipopeptide HPLC analysis protocol, all the

Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

18 of 22

volumes used were adapted. A sample of 100 µL of the lipopeptide mixture concentrated
at 250 mg/L was charged in the HPLC (Online Degaser, 717 Autosampler, 660S Controller,
626 Pump, 996 PhotoDiodeArray, Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The column used was
a C18 (5 µm, 300 × 10 mm, ACE), working at a ﬂow rate of 3 mL/min. The mycosubtilins
were separated with an acetonitrile–water–triﬂuoroacetic acid solvent, 35:65:0.1, v/v/v
for 54 min, followed by a 6 min rinsing step with acetonitrile–triﬂuoroacetic acid solvent,
100:0.1, v/v. As for lipopeptides analysis, the retention time and second derivative of the
absorption spectrum between 200 and 400 nm were used to identify the eluted molecules
(Millenium 32 Software, Waters).

4.6.1. Lipopeptide Tandem Mass Spectrometry MS-MS Analysis

The different isoforms of mycosubtilin produced by B. subtilis BBG100 were deter-
mined by analyzing the puriﬁed samples with tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS), elec-
trospray, and an ion trap. Measurements were made by direct infusion of the open peptide
after treatment with N-bromosuccinimide, as described previously [9,60].

4.6.2. Determination of the Mycosubtilin Isoforms by GC

The identiﬁcation of mycosubtilin isoforms was completed with performing GC. The
protocol used for hydrolysis of mycosubtilin was the one for iturinic compounds [33].
Brieﬂy, 1 mg of lipopeptide was hydrolyzed in the presence of 12 M HCl/methanol (30/70)
during 15 h at 150 ◦C. Methanol was evaporated and fatty acids were extracted with
chloroform. The extract was washed twice with water milliQ. Chloroform was evaporated
and the fatty acids were suspended in 100% methanol. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)
of the samples and the reference compounds were prepared by boron triﬂuoride-catalyzed
methylation (AOCS, 1998) and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The analysis of
the MEFAs in hexane was performed with a GC system (HP6890, Agilent Technologies
Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a split–splitless injector and a ﬂame ionization
detector. An INNOWAX capillary column (Agilent, ref.19091N-133; length, 30 m; diameter,
0.25 mm; 0.25 m ﬁlm) was used to separate the MEFAs. The GC conditions were as
follows: injector temperature at 250 ◦C and detector temperature at 250 ◦C. The carrier gas
was helium at a ﬂow rate of 2.4 mL/min. The temperature program is 10 min at 50 ◦C,
30 ◦C/min to 150 ◦C; 4 ◦C/min to 240 ◦C; and 10 min at 240 ◦C. The fatty acids were
identiﬁed by GC by an injection of Supelco (ref.47885-U) and Larodan standards for iso and
anteiso fatty acids (ref.11-1514-7 and 11-1614-7).

4.7. Cellular Fatty Acid Analysis

The cells were harvested from the 100 mL cultures and centrifugated at 10,000× g for
10 min at 4 ◦C. The pellets were washed twice with sterile distilled water and transferred
into extraction screw-cap tubes. Bacteria were subsequently submitted to saponiﬁcation
and methylation, and their fatty acid methyl esters were extracted, as described previ-
ously [61]. Analysis of fatty acid methyl esters was carried out by gas chromatography
performed on a Shimadzu GC14A gas chromatograph (Courtaboeuf, France) equipped
with a 30 m × 0.25 mm BPX5 (SGE, Villeneuve St George, France) capillary column, as
previously described [62].

4.8. Bacterial Dry Weight Analysis

The bacterial dry weight was determined after drying for 48 h at 110 ◦C in a washed
pellet of a 10 mL sample. The optical density at 600 nm was read with a spectrophotometer
SECOMAN Prim (SECOMAN, Domont, France).

4.9. Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations

Antifungal activity tests against A. niger were performed by successive half-dilutions
of various solutions of mycosubtilin isoforms (iso-C16, n-C16, anteiso-C17 and iso-C17) in
96-well microplates containing 200 µL of culture medium (glucose, 40 g/L; peptone, 10 g/L;

Metabolites 2022, 12, 107

yeast extract, 2 g/L) [13]. A standard mycosubtilin mixture was also tested, composed
of iso-C16 (26%), Gln3 C17 (1%), n-C16 (2%), anteiso-C17 (45%), and iso-C17 (23%). The
inoculation of the two microorganisms was realized at an optical density of 0.55 followed
by an incubation at 28 ◦C and 280 rpm. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
determined after 24 h of incubation.

5. Conclusions

In this work, we implemented a metabolic engineering strategy based on two ap-
proaches in parallel (transcriptomics and bioinformatics) to target genetic modiﬁcations,
allowing the selective production of mycosubtilin isoforms, and more particularly, the
C17-anteiso isoform. Thanks to a major reﬁnement of the model of the previously de-
veloped BCA metabolic pathway, we were able to predict new gene knock-out or gene
overexpression targets, tested of which were tested in vivo. Overexpression of the ilvA
gene showed a signiﬁcant impact on the production of the desired mycosubtilin isoform,
while codY knockout showed more contrasting results. This work allowed us to reﬁne
the prediction tool, making it more reliable, notably by simplifying certain reactions and
removing feedback loops. However, from a bioinformatics point of view, further research
is needed to obtain equally reliable predictions, taking into account the feedback loops. In
addition, the other predictions shown in this work represent a gold mine of information for
future optimization work.
