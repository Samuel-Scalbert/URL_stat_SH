Abstract

During   the   last   decade,   Web   APIs   (Application   Programming   Interface)   have   gained
significant   traction   to   the   extent   that   they   have   become   a   de-facto   standard   to   enable
HTTP-based, machine-processable data access. Despite this success, however, they still
often fail in making data interoperable, insofar as they commonly rely on proprietary data
models and vocabularies that lack formal semantic descriptions essential to ensure reliable
data integration. In the biodiversity domain, multiple data aggregators, such as the Global
Biodiversity   Information   Facility   (GBIF)   and   the   Encyclopedia   of   Life   (EoL),   maintain
specialized Web APIs giving access to billions of records about taxonomies, occurrences,
or life traits (Triebel et al. 2012). They publish data sets spanning complementary and often
overlapping   regions,   epochs   or   domains,   but   may   also   report   or   rely   on   potentially
conflicting perspectives, e.g. with respect to the circumscription of taxonomic concepts. It is
therefore of utmost importance for biologists and collection curators to be able to confront
the   knowledge   they   have   about   taxa   with   related   data   coming   from   third-party   data
sources.

To   tackle   this   issue,   the   French   National   Museum   of   Natural   History   (MNHN)   has
developed an application to edit TAXREF, the French taxonomic register for fauna, flora

and fungus (Gargominy et al. 2018). TAXREF registers all species recorded in metropolitan
France   and   overseas   territories,   accounting   for   260,000+   biological   taxa   (200,000+
species) along with 570,000+ scientific names. The TAXREF-Web application compares
data available in TAXREF with corresponding data from third-party data sources, points out
disagreements and allows biologists to add, remove or amend TAXREF accordingly. This
requires that TAXREF-Web developers write a specific piece of code for each considered
Web API to align TAXREF representation with the Web API counterpart. This task is time-
consuming and makes maintenance of the web application cumbersome.

In this presentation, we report on a new implementation of TAXREF-Web that harnesses
the Linked Data standards: Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web
format to represent knowledge graphs, and  SPARQL, the W3C standard to query RDF
graphs.   In   addition,   we   leverage   the   SPARQL   Micro-Service  architecture   (Michel   et   al.
2018), a lightweight approach to query Web APIs using SPARQL. A SPARQL micro-service
is   a   SPARQL   endpoint   that   wraps   a   Web   API   service;   it   typically   produces   a   small,
resource-centric RDF graph by invoking the Web API and transforming the response into
RDF triples.

We developed SPARQL micro-services to wrap the Web APIs of GBIF, World Register of
Marine Species (WoRMS), FishBase, Index Fungorum, Pan-European Species directories
Infrastructure (PESI), ZooBank, International Plant Names Index (IPNI), EoL, Tropicos and
Sandre. These micro-services consistently translate Web APIs responses into RDF graphs
utilizing mainly two well-adopted vocabularies: Schema.org (Guha et al. 2015) and Darwin
Core (Baskauf et al. 2015). This approach brings about two major advantages. First, the
large   adoption   of   Schema.org   and   Darwin   Core   ensures   that   the   services   can   be
immediately understood and reused by a large audience within the biodiversity community.
Second, wrapping all these Web APIs in SPARQL micro-services “suddenly” makes them
technically   and   semantically   interoperable,   since   they   all   represent   resources   (taxa,
habitats, traits, etc.) in a common manner. Consequently, the integration task is simplified:
confronting   data   from   multiple   sources   essentially   consists   of   writing   the   appropriate
SPARQL queries, thus making easier web application development and maintenance. We
present several concrete cases in which we use this approach to detect disagreements
between   TAXREF   and   the   aforementioned   data   sources,   with   respect   to   taxonomic
information (author, synonymy, vernacular names, classification, taxonomic rank), habitats,
bibliographic references, species interactions and life traits.
