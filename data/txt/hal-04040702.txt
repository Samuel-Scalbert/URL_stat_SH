The relational database SOWELL was created to better understand the behaviour and individual
responses of gestating sows facing different short-term events induced: a competitive situation for feed,
hot and cold thermal conditions, a sound event, an enrichment (straw, ropes and bags available) and an
impoverishment (no straw, no objects) of the pen. The data were collected on 102 crossbred sows
equipped with activity sensors, group-housed in video-recorded pens (16–18 sows per pen), with access
to automatons. Feeding and drinking behaviours were extracted from the electronic feeders and drinkers’
recordings. Social behaviours, physical activities and locations in the pen were recorded thanks to manual
video analysis labelling at the individual scale. Accelerometer ﬁxed on the sows’ ears also recorded indi-
vidual physical activities. The physical activity was also determined at a group scale by automatic video
analysis using deep learning techniques. BWs, back fat thickness, and body condition (cleanliness, body
damages) were recorded weekly during the whole gestation. Last gestation room data regarding environ-
mental conditions (temperature, humidity, noise level) were recorded using automatic sensors. The data-
base can fulﬁl different research purposes, namely sows’ nutrition for example to better calculate the
energy requirements regarding environmental factors, or also on welfare or health during gestation by
providing indicators.

Sows’ feeding and drinking behaviours
were collected thanks to two electronic
feeders and two electronic water
suppliers. Physical activities were
extracted from accelerometers
(individual scale) and automatic video
analysis (group scale). Social behaviours
and locations in the room were collected
thanks to manual video analysis
(individual scale). Environmental
conditions (temperature, humidity, noise
level) were recorded by sensors. Growth
performances and body status were
registered thanks to a BW scale and a
back fat thickness ultrasound portable
device. Body conditions (cleanliness,
body damages) were collected weekly.

A total of 102 group-housed sows were
followed during their gestation. Sows
faced induced short-term events during
their gestation: competitive feeding
situations, cold and hot thermal
conditions, unexcepted sound events,
enrichment or impoverishment of the
pen. Each event followed a control week
that was without any unusual event.

All data collected by sensors and
automatons during the experiment were
cleaned (removal of the outliers) and
organised as a relational database.

Value of the data

(cid:1) This data set presents a huge diversity of data collected on ges-
tating sows at an individual scale: feeding and drinking beha-
viours, social behaviours, physical activities,
reproductive
performances, health and welfare status, and environmental
conditions.

(cid:1) High number of individual data, mostly time series, can be used
by researchers for machine learning approaches or data mining
tasks requiring large datasets.

(cid:1) Different short-term events can be useful for scientists to better
understand sow’s behaviour and individual variability of
response to these different types of events.

(cid:1) Finally, access to the database is made public to contribute to
future research in gestating sows’ behaviour, health, nutrition
or welfare ﬁelds.

Data description

The dataset is composed of 18 tables structured as a relational
database, using SQL standard (Table 1). These tables are organised
into three groups (Fig. 1):

tain data collected by automatons or sensors at different time
scales (in green, Fig. 1)

– The tables named Farrowing, Health_sow, Performances_sow,
Sow_temperature, Activity_video_measure, Video_analysis contain
other collected data (in blue, Fig. 1).

More precisely, Farm, Sow, Pen, Group, Exp_sow, Event and Sensor
tables gather all information regarding, respectively: farms (coun-
try, number of sows per band and number of sow per feeder), sows
(birth date and farm), gestation rooms (farm), groups (beginning
and end date, gestation room), sows during an experiment (sow,
artiﬁcial insemination date and boar identiﬁcation dose, body con-
dition at insemination, parity), events (date and kind), and sensors
or automatons used (type, room of gestation).

Water_measure and Feed_measure tables describe all visits to
the automatons (sow number, automatons used, date and hour of
the beginning of the visit and its duration, and the amount eaten or
drank). Sound_measure, Air_temperature_measure and Activity_mea-
sure tables gather the recordings of, respectively, the sound level
meter (every seconds), the thermometer at group scale (every 5
minutes) and the accelerometers (every 30 minutes) at individual
scale (date and hour of the measure, values measured). Farrowing
table contains the number of piglets and the litter’s weight at birth
and weaning. Health_sow and Performances_sow tables gather the
weekly recording of health problems, and BW and back fat thick-
ness. The rectal and body temperatures are saved in Sow_tempera-
ture
table including the sow’s posture at measurement.
Activity_video table gathers the data provided by automatic video
analysis at group level (every 30 minutes).

Experimental design, materials and methods

Experimental protocol

The experiment took place at Pig Physiology and Phenotyping
Experimental Facility (UE3P, INRAE, Rennes, France, https://doi.
org/10.15454/1.5573932732039927E12).
It included 102 cross-
bred sows (Landrace (cid:3) Large White), divided into ﬁve groups (ap-
proximately 20 sows), monitored throughout their gestation. The
sows were group-housed (a few days after their artiﬁcial insemina-
tion) in a pen with a concrete ﬂoor enriched with straw (replaced
daily), and the provision of two ‘‘playing” chains. After 30 days, the
sows not successfully inseminated (identiﬁed by echography) were
moved out of the pen and of the experiment. The pen dimensions
were 7.5 by 8.2 m, for a space allowance of 3.1 m2/sow for an initial
group of 20 sows. Each sow was equipped with two radio fre-
quency identiﬁcation tags: one for the two self-locking electronic
feeders (Gestal, JYGA Technologies Inc, Québec, Canada), and the
other for the two electronic drinkers (Asserva, France). The feed
was a blend of two diets (Low and High nutrient content), mixed
and delivered daily by the feeder to each individual sow. A gestat-
ing sows’ nutritional InraPorc model revised by Gaillard et al.
(2019) was used to estimate the daily nutrient requirements of
each sow. Based on this information, the quantity of feed to supply
and the daily proportions of the two diets to blend were calculated
for each sow. With this feeding strategy, the quantity of feed to
supply was individualised but ﬁxed for each sow during all their
gestation, except for a bump feeding of 500 g/d starting at 86 days.
Two ceiling-mounted cameras (RS-CCPOE280IR4-DH, Ro-main Inc.,
Québec, Canada) provided a continuous day and night recording.

perature and humidity were recorded thanks to sensors ﬁxed in
the gestation room at 1.8 m high from the ground (Lascar Electron-
ics, United Kingdom, precision ± 0.45 (cid:3)C), and the noise level by a
sensor near one of the drinkers (Velleman Group, Belgium). Man-
ual video analysis was carried out by trained observers to monitor
individual social behaviour, localisation, occupation, and physical
activity on deﬁned short periods of 5–36 h. Sows were also
equipped with an ear tag accelerometer (RF-Track, Rennes, France)
continuously recording their physical activities. Physical activities
were also automatically analysed at a group scale from video
recordings by a convolutional neural network algorithm (Dilepix,
Rennes, France; Durand et al., 2022). Data extracted from automa-
tons and sensors were preprocessed to ﬁlter the outliers and aggre-
gated daily sensors’ ﬁles to feed a relational database. Row data
from the accelerometers were not included in the database when
the cumulated duration per hour was not equal to 60 minutes,
and in case of duplicated rows. All the identiﬁcation codes of
automatons or sensors were linked to the experiment number of
each sow.

Every Monday morning during the gestation, sows were led to a
nearby room in order to measure their BW (Schippers, The Nether-
lands, precision ± 0.5 kg), and their back fat thickness using an
ultrasound portable device (Imago, ECM, France). Body conditions,
including skin lesions and potential health problems, were also
simultaneously recorded based on the Welfare Quality(cid:4) Assess-
ment (Dalmau et al., 2009). At the end of the gestation (i.e. one
week before parturition), sows were transferred to the farrowing
room, after recording their BW and their back fat thickness. During
the ﬁrst 6 hours after farrowing, the BW of the sow and its piglets

were registered, as well as the number of piglets alive or stillbirth.
The number of artiﬁcial inseminations, the date, and the boar iden-
tiﬁcation dose were also recorded.

Induced short-term events

In addition to the setting up of the hierarchy at the constitution
of the group, different perturbations events were induced during
the experiment: a competitive feeding situation, cold and hot ther-
mal variations, a sound event, and last, an enrichment and an
impoverishment of the pen (Fig. 2). A competitive feeding situation
was created by closing one of the two available feeders for ﬁve con-
secutive days and nights. This was performed twice during gesta-
tion. The cold thermal condition was induced for three days and
nights by increasing the ventilation frequency, opening the win-
dows, and setting the thermostatic control at 12 ± 2 (cid:3)C. Similarly,
a hot thermal condition was induced thanks to two heaters,
decreased of ventilation frequency and setting the thermostatic
control at 32 ± 2 (cid:3)C. The noise event was composed of random
emission of 40 short sounds (alarms, animals, metallic and human
voices) of 30 seconds, every 10 minutes for four consecutive hours
twice a day (during the afternoon resting period, and during the
night feeding period). The enrichment consisted of an extra straw
supply in the pen in the ﬁrst repetition and in the second by the
provision of jute bags, a brush, and ropes inside the pen. During
the impoverishment event, there was no straw or games in the
pen. Each ‘‘event week” followed a ‘‘control week” (without any
unusual perturbation event induced).
