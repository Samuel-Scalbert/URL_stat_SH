Abstract

EU   policies,   such   as   the   EU   biodiversity   strategy   2030   and   the   Birds   and   Habitats
Directives, demand unbiased, integrated and regularly updated biodiversity and ecosystem
service data. However, efforts to monitor wildlife and other species groups are spatially and
temporally fragmented, taxonomically biased, and lack integration in Europe. To bridge this
gap, the MAMBO project will develop, test and implement enabling tools for monitoring
conservation   status   and   ecological   requirements   of   species   and   habitats   for   which
knowledge gaps still exist. MAMBO brings together the technical expertise of computer

science,   remote   sensing,   social   science   expertise   on   human-technology   interactions,
environmental   economy,   and   citizen   science,   with   the   biological   expertise   on   species,
ecology, and conservation biology. MAMBO is built around stakeholder engagement and
knowledge exchange (WP1) and the integration of new technology with existing research
infrastructures   (WP2).   MAMBO   will   develop,   test,   and   demonstrate   new   tools   for
monitoring   species   (WP3)   and   habitats   (WP4)   in   a   co-design   process   to   create   novel
standards for species and habitat monitoring across the EU and beyond. MAMBO will work
with   stakeholders   to   identify   user   and   policy   needs   for   biodiversity   monitoring   and
investigate the requirements for setting up a virtual lab to automate workflow deployment
and efficient computing of the vast data streams (from on the ground sensors, and remote
sensing)   required   to   improve   monitoring   activities   across   Europe   (WP4).   Together   with
stakeholders,   MAMBO   will   assess   these   new   tools   at   demonstration   sites   distributed
across Europe (WP5) to identify bottlenecks, analyze the cost-effectiveness of different
tools, integrate data streams and upscale results (WP6). This will feed into the co-design of
future,   improved   and   more   cost-effective   monitoring   schemes   for   species   and   habitats
using novel technologies (WP7), and thus lead to a better management of protected sites
and species.

1. Excellence

1.1. Objectives and ambition

The   MAMBO   project   aims   to   realise   the   huge   potential   of   cutting-edge   technology   for
species   and   habitat   monitoring   in   the   EU   by   advancing   and   integrating   sensor
development,   deep   learning,   computer   vision,   acoustics,   ecology,   remote   sensing,
biodiversity   monitoring,   citizen   science,   data   pipelines   and   ecological   modelling.   Fine-
grained   classification   algorithms   have   matured   to   the   point   where   it   is   possible   to
accurately   identify   organisms   automatically   from   digital   data   such   as   images   or   sound.
Similarly, high spatial resolution remote sensing data from the Copernicus satellite Earth
observation   programme   and   other   sources   such   as   drones   and   airborne   LiDAR   are
bringing new opportunities for habitat extent and condition assessments. These technical
breakthroughs set the future of ecological monitoring as automated systems will expand
the extent and resolution of biodiversity monitoring and increasingly complement traditional
approaches used by professional ecologists and community scientists. These systems are
highly   scalable,   especially   in   remote   locations   that   are   often   data   sparse   yet   highly
sensitive   to   environmental   change.   They   also   have   the   potential   to   revolutionize   the
number of observations being gathered on diverse but often overlooked taxa that play a
major   role   in   overall   biodiversity,   ecosystem   health,   and   ecological   services   such   as
pollination. Furthermore, these tools will engage a much wider diversity of stakeholders to

become involved. In particular, these tools open up the potential for active involvement of
non-experts in the process of environmental monitoring and biodiversity assessments and
will finally help to bridge taxonomic and monitoring gaps and lead to a better understanding
of biodiversity declines and their main drivers.

The   EU   Biodiversity   Strategy   2030   in   support   of   the   Green   Deal   is   very   clear   about
biodiversity   and   our   future:   We   need   nature   in   our   lives   and   protecting   and   restoring
biodiversity and well-functioning ecosystems is key to our own future. One of the reasons
for this call is that the status of biodiversity in Europe is generally below standard and
many targets are not being met (e.g., a favourable situation for all species and habitats
listed in the Birds and Habitats Directives). Specifically, biodiversity status and trends have
not improved since 2010 despite biodiversity targets and actions that were planned. Major
pressures on biodiversity have remained high, and are increasing in many instances. For
example, more than 80% of EU territory is under agricultural or forestry management and
is only slowly becoming more sustainable and biodiversity-friendly. Similarly, the supply of
ecosystem services have not increased since 2010, while the demand has (Maes and al.
2020). The combination of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss with the mismatch
in supply and demand of nature’s services is not what we want or need, and costs of our
inaction are high and increasing (OECD May 2019). The Green Deal, including the EU
biodiversity   strategy   2030   and   international   strategies   such   as   the   UN   Decade   on
Ecosystem Restoration, the CBD post-2020 framework, the IPBES Global Assessment on
Biodiversity   and   the   post-2020   Global   Biodiversity   Framework   all   point   in   the   same
direction: We need an integrated approach to securing biodiversity, economy and human
well-being. This requires substantial transformative change across policy domains (nature
conservation, agriculture, economy, energy). MAMBO will help to achieve this by making
substantial progress beyond current practice and state-of-the-art in biodiversity monitoring
and respective data integration. It will do so in a way that is not only completely compatible
with the EU strategies mentioned above, but that guides the way towards healthy, living
landscapes.   Here,   we   summarize   our   main   objectives   and   how   we   will   address   the
technical and practical challenges of realising new ways of monitoring biodiversity in the
EU:

The main objectives of MAMBO are to:

Develop, evaluate and integrate image and sound recognition-based AI solutions
for EU biodiversity monitoring from species to habitats.
Develop, test and deliver high spatial resolution regional EU habitat extent maps
(satellite remote sensing) and site-specific (e.g. Nature 2000), but EU consistent,
habitat condition metrics (airborne LiDAR and drone data).
Promote   the   standardized   calculation   and   automated   retrieval   of   habitat   metrics
using in-situ observations, deep learning and remote sensing.
Co-design   MAMBO’s   novel   ecological   monitoring   tools   with   researchers,   policy
makers,   citizens   and   other   stakeholders,   evaluate   their   costs   and   benefits   and
make them widely available.

Build a new global community of practice for the development and application of
these   cutting-edge   technologies   through   proof-of-concept   implementation   across
the EU.
Test and implement existing and MAMBO’s novel tools for upscaling, and contribute
to an integrated European biodiversity monitoring system with potential for dynamic
adaptations.

How MAMBO relates to the work programme?

The main aim of the work programme is to provide the knowledge, tools and infrastructure
for monitoring wildlife and their habitats. Related to aim:

MAMBO tools and data will be FAIR and thus contribute to the digital literacy of
Europe. MAMBO will make use of a wealth of data sources (from remote sensing to
citizen   science   and   from   global   and   European   to   national   and   local   data)   and
integrate them into tools and applications that can become the basis of public and
private   technologies   to   enable   spatial   planning   (e.g.   biodiversity   mapping   and
recording),   well   being   and   health   (e.g.   identification   of   disease   vectors   and
development of green space), and green growth (e.g. tools for precision agriculture
and monitoring the impact of economic activities).
MAMBO tools will facilitate ecological restoration as its tools make monitoring of all
biodiversity (species and habitats, with focus of EU directives) easier and more
accurate, provide decision-support for nature conservation and guidance of nature
restoration and development.
MAMBO image and sound recognition tools will facilitate digital decision support
tools   in   other   sectors   such   as   agriculture,   transport   and   energy.   For   example,
chemical-free crop protection depends on accurate early-warning of looming pests
and diseases. Image-recognition tools, such as automated insect cameras, will be
used to do that. Also, MAMBO tools can be used to evaluate and monitor impact of
economic activities. Not only their harmful effects (e.g. habitat degradation), but
also their positive contribution (e.g. afforestation and restoration).
MAMBO   tools   will   enable   citizens   to   sense   their   environment   directly.   This   will
increase   citizen   participation   level   (and   influence)   in   environmental,   protection,
health, and wellbeing areas.

Specifically,   MAMBO   will   address   the   following   challenges   identified   in   the   work
programme:

1.

How can we implement a cost-efficient system for species and habitat monitoring
across the EU that maximises the automation, extent and resolution of biodiversity
monitoring?
Which   tools,   technologies,   and   AI-identification   methodologies   can   bridge
taxonomic   and   monitoring   gaps   for   European   wildlife   supporting   adaptive
monitoring?

How can we integrate, access and promote (standardised, open and FAIR) data,
knowledge   and   models   for   improving   conservation   status   and   ecological
requirements of species and habitats in the EU?
How   can   we   inform   EU   policy   (e.g.   the   Birds   and   Habitats   Directives,   EU
biodiversity   strategy   2030)   and   other   sectors   (e.g.   agriculture,   energy   or
bioeconomy)   in   (near)   real   time   about   biodiversity   status   and   trends,   emerging
threats and underlying drivers of decline?

Innovation potential 

In order to make biodiversity something that society can quantify and monitor, MAMBO is
bringing   together   world   leaders   in   research   on   novel   monitoring   technologies   (proximal
sensors, remote sensing, crowd sources), and decision support tools. MAMBO will invent,
build, evaluate, and promote tools that are streamlined with existing data collection efforts
and engage with stakeholders and end-users (Fig. 1). Using these easy-to-use and reliable
tools,  MAMBO will equip a wider range   of people   to participate  in  species  and  habitat
monitoring.   Stakeholder   engagement   will   occur   from   project   inception   through   to
completion to ensure that user needs, and co-development form a core part of this project.
We   will   ensure   open   and   clear   lines   of   communication   between   the   technological
innovations   team   and   relevant   groups   of   stakeholders   from   policy   makers   through   to
practitioners, at local, national, and regional levels, to enable useability and ease of uptake
for the tools being developed. This interdisciplinary approach will maximise the potential for
both   technological,   social   and   institutional   innovations.   Co-design   (WP1)   and
demonstration (WP5) of MAMBO’s unique collection of hardware solutions, open-source
software and crowd sourced data (WP3, WP4), which monitors and assesses the impact of
various   actions   on   different   ecosystems   and   which   is   fully   aligned   with   existing   and
ongoing   research   infrastructures   and   data   sources   (WP2).   Furthermore,   community
engagement and crowdsourcing platforms are immensely important (from WP1, 5, and 7).
Due to the integration, improvement, and application of existing technologies on a variety
of real-world biodiversity challenges, this will offer great opportunities for innovations in
application and uptake. Social innovations need a strong focus on co-design and cost-
benefit analyses to increase acceptance and ensure the ultimate implementation of novel
monitoring technologies and approaches. MAMBO will ensure this by co-designing novel
monitoring   tools   with   constant   involvement   of,   and   feedback   to   relevant   stakeholders,
identifying ways   to   incentivize   their   uptake,   while   overcoming   potential   barriers   (WP1).
Also, cost-benefit analyses will identify the optimal combination of monitoring approaches
under given local or regional contexts (WP6). Close interactions with local stakeholders at
demonstration sites (WP5) empower local communities, train local actors, raise the societal
appreciation   of   biodiversity   and   engage   local   governments   and   regulators   to   change
priorities.   This   unique,   multi-disciplinary   and   innovative   approach   will   guarantee   a
significant, long-term and sustainable impact maintained due to local involvement.

Research and innovation maturity of MAMBO tools 

A range of innovative tools conceived by members of the consortium will be enhanced and
made more widely available as part of MAMBO (Table 1). In addition, MAMBO will exploit

6

its gravitational force for new monitoring technology to form a hub for tool developers to
increase technology readiness levels (TRLs) of their products and services.

1.2. Methodology

1.2.1 Overall methodology

From concept to structure: The core concept of MAMBO is that new technology will bring
the   highest   value   to   society   through   a   co-design   process   with   users   and   other

 
 
Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biоdiversity (MAMBO)

stakeholders.   Too   often   tools   are   built   without   thinking   enough   about   the   linkages   to
existing research infrastructures and products or the long-term sustainability of their use by
the often highly variable end-users. The project is therefore structured across three pillars.
First,   we   will   identify   existing   tools,   approaches   and   research   infrastructures   and   the
respective   user   needs   (co-design   and   infrastructures).   On   this   basis,   we   will   build   and
refine novel tools based on cutting edge technology (tools and technologies). Finally, we
will test and demonstrate the implementation of MAMBO’s novel monitoring tools across
the   EU,   integrate   and   disseminate   the   outcomes,   and   assess   their   pros   and   cons   and
relevance to EU policy (Implementation and dissemination).

Taxonomic focus of MAMBO: Our taxonomic focus is intentionally broad, driven by the
needs of the EU as expressed through the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, EU Red Lists
and   the   EU   list   of   invasive   alien   species.   Using   images   and   sounds   as   input,   we
specifically target rare and threatened species and knowledge gaps in European birds,
bats, mammals, plants and insects, including many important pollinators (bees, butterflies,
moths   and   hoverflies).   At   present   there   are   many   pilot   projects   and   field   tests   for
automated (AI-based) monitoring of these taxa, but major knowledge gaps exist as hardly
any reliable, well standardised, and cost-efficient data pipeline is currently available for
deriving quantitative (data-driven) biodiversity indicators at the European scale.

Species   identification   using   deep   learning   (objective   1):   In   the   last   ten   years,
automated   identification   tools   have   progressed   considerably   thanks   to   deep   learning
techniques   and   the   increasing   availability   of   training   data.   There   are   now   mobile
applications such as Pl@ntNet, ObsIdentify, Seek, Merlin or BirdNet that allow millions of
users to identify the species they encounter simply by taking pictures of them or recording
the sounds they make. The data collected by this type of application, however, are subject
to   significant   observation   bias,   in   particular   because   not   all   species   present   on   the
observation site are listed. Data from repeated, standardised surveys, therefore, remain
indispensable, if only to correct the biases of models built from opportunistic citizen data.
However,   the   high   costs   of   implementation   of   these   inventories   strongly   limits   the
frequency   of   their   realization   and   their   replication   incontrasting   environments.   Passive
acoustic monitoring, in particular, is a valuable sampling tool for habitat assessments and
the observation of environmental niches which often are endangered. However, manual
processing   of   large   collections   of   soundscape   data   remains   a   challenge.   Similarly,   the
recurrent   monitoring   of   plants   carried   out   in   the   form   of   protocolized   inventories   of
uniformly sized quadrats (typically 1x1m) is one of the most common approaches used by
natural area managers for monitoring over time and along environmental gradients. The
automation   of   this   type   of   approach   would   transform   the   capacities   of   managers,   by
granting them greater autonomy as well as an unprecedented study capacity. In order to
significantly reduce monitoring costs, MAMBO will develop a new generation of automated
identification tools aimed at identifying species assemblages directly. In particular, we will
develop   new   deep   learning   models   for   the detection   and   identification   of   birds   in
soundscapes with the objective to bridge the acoustic gap between high-quality training
recordings   and   soundscapes   with   high   ambient   noise   levels   which   is   one   of   the   most
challenging tasks in the domain of audio event recognition. In addition, we will also work on

8

Høye T et al

the realization of floristic monitoring from cover pictures (quadrat photos in particular). This
will   require   working   on   new   deep   learning   approaches   based   on   tile   classification   or
instance segmentation utilizing the data collected and models trained within the Pl@ntNet
platform.

Structured species monitoring using field sensors (objective 1): Sensors are widely
used for many areas of environmental monitoring, solutions for sensor-based ecological
monitoring are in their infancy. In theory, cameras have many advantages over traditional
approaches. They remove observer bias and data collection and can collect standardised,
high-resolution data across long time scales. Cameras can be baited in similar ways to
traditional light and pheromone traps or placed over ephemeral natural resources such as
flowers, fruits, dung, fungi, or carrion. Cameras can be installed in remote locations using
solar, wind or battery power. “Internet of Things”- enabled hardware offers the potential of
‘edge   computing’   to   implement   classification   algorithms   in   the   field   to   provide   fully
autonomous systems that report detection and classification data back to the user in real
time. When harnessed together, camera traps and computer vision can deliver novel high-
throughput systems for detection, classification, and enumeration of species and alongside
functional   metrics   such   as   biomass.   Machine   listening/audio   analysis   has   a   similar
potential for biodiversity monitoring. Originating in speech recognition technology, systems
now exist for diverse general music, urban and domestic sound. Automated audio sensors
are increasingly common in ecological surveys, while smartphone birdsong recordings are
widely collated in projects such as Xeno Canto and iNaturalist, and can be automatically
recognised (Stowell and Plumbley 2014, Stowell et al. 2018). In practice, there are still
many challenges associated with the transition to sensor based monitoring. In MAMBO, we
will build on newly developed sensors (by partner AU) for automated monitoring (Bjerge et
al. 2021, Høye et al. 2021).

Habitat   type   classification   and   mapping   (objective   2):   Modern   deep   learning
techniques have great potential for modeling species distributions (SDM) and recognizing
habitats (Botella et al. 2018). In particular, experiments with convolutional neural networks
(CNN) have shown that they have the ability to capture complex information about the
spatial structure of the environment and landscape (Deneu et al. 2021). One limitation of
CNNs, however, is that their architecture induces an intrinsic inductive bias in the sense
that they process the signal only locally (e.g. in the neighbourhood of each pixel), and thus,
they cannot accurately model long-distance relationships. They are, therefore, not really
suitable   for   modelling   the   relationship   between   habitats   at   micro   and   macro-level.   In
contrast,   transformers   (Dosovitskiy   and   al.   2020),   which   are   a   different   kind   of   deep
learning   models,   go   beyond   local   processing   and   exploit   long-term   dependencies   for
increased   performance.   However,   their   use   in   geographic   information   systems   is   still   a
largely   unexplored  but   promising  research   field.   Such   models   should   allow   segmenting
habitats in a much more efficient manner than current methods without requiring expensive
field surveys. In particular, MAMBO will build on Inria’s recent work on transformer models
(Caron et al. 2021, Liutkus et al. 2021) to segment and classify habitats in high-resolution
satellite data (typically sentinel 2 image series) coupled with environmental rasters. The
models will be pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on very large volumes of data and

then   fine-tuned   on   supervised   data   to   produce   habitat   type   maps   (EUNIS   typology   in
particular). For this second step, we will help ourselves with recent results coupling EUNIS
types with plant species composition (plant occurrence data being much more numerous
than habitat type records).

Assessing habitat condition (objective 3): Being able to accurately assess a habitat’s
condition is vital to cost-efficient nature management. Condition indicators vary with habitat
but generally are based on metrics that range from describing the presence/abundance of
plant   and animal   species   to   characterising   3-dimensional   vegetation   structures   and
temporal   vegetation   dynamics.   Establishing   habitat   condition   and   conservation   status
remains a challenge. It generally involves in-situ surveying and can be semi-qualitative,
and currently, there is no consistency in how condition is measured and reported across
Europe. While some of these metrics (e.g. plant height, % bare ground, % woody cover,
vertical woody density, individual plant abundance, disturbance feature density) are well
suited for a remote sensing (RS) approach, wide-scale condition assessment has been
limited so far because available relevant data is either of insufficient spatial detail (i.e. free
satellite   data)   or   of   limited   temporal   frequency,   limited   coverage,   costly   or   not   easily
accessible and varied across countries and regions (i.e. drone, airborne or commercial
satellite data). In addition, national RS-based habitat level condition assessments would
require the storage, access and processing of large data volumes. Cloud-based solutions
exist, however, so far the focus is on satellite data (e.g. Google Earth Engine, Sentinel Hub
Platform) or limited to drone data pre-processing using licensed software (e.g. Agisoft) and
the   shared   open   source   scripts   are   mostly   research   project   specific   and   so   difficult   to
reuse.   The   lack   of   easily   accessible   computational   infrastructure   (with   standardised
analysis tools and enhanced processing workflows) for LiDAR and drone data is stifling
operational use.

MAMBO will focus on developing condition metrics from airborne LiDAR and drone data.
Both offer the high spatial detail required for condition assessment at scales useful to land
managers   and   decision   makers   and   have   the   potential   of   delivering   metrics   that   are
relevant to a wide range of habitats. These metrics will be identified through a review of
field manuals and stakeholder feedback. Critically, MAMBO will evaluate in detail current
barriers to airborne LiDAR and drone data use in habitat condition assessments and share
its   findings   with   stakeholder   groups   interested   in   LiDAR   and   drone   data   exploitation.
Envisaging a future where LiDAR and drone data are two of many data types (e.g. satellite,
in situ, citizen science) processed to deliver metrics through a user-friendly cloudbased
virtual   lab   for   biodiversity   monitoring,   MAMBO   will   convert   the   scripts   developed   by
MAMBO’s   RS   experts   into   interactive   computing   workflows   and   automate   workflow
deployment. The idea is to produce processing pipelines that will work with locally relevant
LiDAR and/or drone data but deliver metrics that are consistent across the EU, enabling
both local and EU- wide reporting to the Habitat Directive.

To derive the selected condition metrics from LiDAR and drone data, MAMBO will apply
current state-of-the-art methods, but will also develop new methods that can better exploit
the large volume and spatially detailed information coming from these types of technology.
Specifically,   we   will   apply   deep   learning   directly   to   raw   LiDAR   point   clouds   and

10

Høye T et al

preprocessed   drone   data   (RGB,   multi-spectral,   point   clouds)   to   avoid   losing   important
details   when   using   only   statistical   approaches.   This   is   particularly   relevant   for   metrics
reliant on feature identification (e.g. drainage, erosion features, individual indicator plants,
flower heads). We will test and validate our approaches across habitats and countries by
working with available (open-access) LiDAR and newly collected drone data on 3 single
large   and   data-rich   sites   (UK:   Salisbury   Plain;   The   Netherlands:   Oostvaardersplassen;
Denmark: Mols Bjerge), and demonstrate our computing workflows on data available for a
German LTER site (Friedeburg).

Using   apps   to   support   society   (objective   4):   Smartphone   applications   that   embed
computer vision and machine listening democratise assessments of species and habitats.
This   empowers   new   sections   of   society   to   create   their   own   understanding   of   their
environment and take action in response. Smartphone applications that make use of these
new   technologies   can   also   host   data   and   information   that   help   the   user   to   ensure   the
quality of the data they collect, provide context to the observations they are making, and
suggest actions in response to what is learned. In agriculture, this approach is being used
by the ESurveyor app (https://assist.ceh.ac.uk/e-surveyor) to provide farmers with a tool for
monitoring the wildflower habitats that they create on their land. Apps of this kind could
also help to build on existing efforts (e.g. https://www.plantlife.org.uk/everyflowercounts) to
encourage gardeners to improve the quality of their green spaces for biodiversity. This has
the effect of raising awareness of the issues of biodiversity decline amongst the public,
empowering   them   to   make   a   change   using   data   they   collect   about   their   garden,   and
through many small actions help to reverse declines. MAMBO will provide image classifiers
through APIs that can be integrated within a range of user interfaces. This will be facilitated
through community engagement, provision of exemplar demonstrations and documentation
on how to access (e.g. through APIs) and deploy MAMBO tools.

Demonstration of enabling tools (objective 5): All tools developed as part of MAMBO
can be applied throughout Europe. In order to test these tools, we will make use of a series
of demonstration sites described below and presented in Fig. 2. Some tools, such as the
image and sound recognition models, will be developed on a European scale and will be
tested on larger regions by making them available to national biodiversity portals (BE, DE,
DK, FR, MT, NL, UK).

France:   French   Mediterranean   natural   reserves,   which   are   based   in   the
Mediterranean   Basin   world   biodiversity   hotspot.   We   will   focus   on   the   middle
elevation   habitats,   and   temporary   swamps   to   highlight   key   habitats   of   the   EU
Habitat   directive.   This   will   be   done   in   close   collaboration   with   the   French
Mediterranean National Botanical Conservatory, which has rich data on the species

cameras and drone surveys is combined with detailed records of the space use of
introduced horses and cattle.
UK:   Salisbury   Plain   (Natura   2000   site   code   UK9011102,   Special   Area   of
Conservation, Special Protected Area) is the single largest area of chalk grassland
in Western Europe and represents 45% of the remaining habitat in the UK. This
military training area occupies some 38,000 ha, and of this 20,000 ha are notified
as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, which includes 14,000 ha of chalk grassland.
UKCEH has led major ecological surveys commencing in 1996, establishing a long-
term monitoring network for vegetation within different areas of disturbance and
shrub encroachment and undertaking larval web surveys for the Marsh Fritillary
butterfly.   A   1m   2014   airborne   LiDAR   survey   and   a   time-series   of   0.25m   aerial
photographic surveys are available.
The   Netherlands:   Oostvaardersplassen   Nature   Reserve   (part   of   National   Park
Nieuw Land in province of Flevoland, NL), an extensive, 5400 ha large restoration
and rewilding site with reed marshland, dry scrubland, swamp forests, grasslands
and   open   water.   The   area   is   of   great   importance   to   birdlife   (breeding   birds,
migratory birds and wintering birds) and has a focus on rewilding and the effects of
large   grazing   herbivores   (horses,   cattle,   deer).   It   is   a   wetland   of   international
importance according to the Ramsar Convention, part of the Natura2000 network
(site code NL9802054), and a Special Protected Area (SPA) according to the EC
Bird Directive. The protected area is managed by Staatsbosbeheer, the National
Forest Service of the Netherlands.
Germany: Friedeburg is a 16 km² LTER site located in the typical agricultural area
of Central Germany with comparably high habitat diversity. It is also part of the
Terrestrial Environmental Observatoria (TERENO) of the Helmholtz Association and
provides a wealth of long-term monitoring and environmental background data (e.g.
vascular plants, wild bees, butterflies, birds).
Malta: The island of Comino and the surrounding islets are found in the Malta-Gozo
Channel and are part of the Natura 2000 network (MT0000017) as a Special Area
of   Conservation   and   Special   Protection   Area.   The   site   is   dominated   by   scrub,
phrygana   and   maquis   habitats   but   supports   other   habitats   of   national   and
community importance (with a total of 10 Annex I habitats being recorded within the
island and surrounding islets) and various rare and endangered endemic species.
Large-scale habitat restoration of maquis, woodland and inland wetland habitats
has also been carried out over the past 4 years.
Bulgaria: LTER Petrohan is situated in the West Balkan range with a total area of
7192 ha. The region is mountainous, and steep, with deeply cut river valleys and
secondary watersheds with the lowest point at an altitude of 350 m, and the highest
at 1900 m. While parts of this area are forested, higher-altitude grasslands and
meadows are also present. Ecosystem investigations have been carried out since
the   establishment   of   the   site   in   1986.   Petrohan   falls   into   the   North-Bulgarian
climatic zone with a moderate continental climate.

Linking data and models to promote integrated European biodiversity monitoring
schemes   (objective   6):   The   development   of   an   integrated   European   biodiversity
monitoring system faces several challenges related to integrating different data streams,
taxonomic   gaps,   geographic   gaps   and   a   lack   of   up-scaling   ability   due   to   context
dependencies. In particular, rare and other threatened species are less well covered by
‘standard’ large-scale monitoring schemes, which often impede the assessment of their
status   and   trends   in   relation   to   changing   environmental   conditions   based   on   the
quantification of their ecological niches, especially at large spatial scales. MAMBO will test
the usability of daily and seasonal performance patterns obtained from novel continuous
monitoring tools to quantify the ecological niche of selected species and the transferability
and upscaling ability of respective mechanistic ecological niche models in space and time.

A   comprehensive   biodiversity   monitoring   system   also   needs   to   integrate   the   wealth   of
citizen   science   data.   They   often   underpin   models   that   seek   to   understand   or   explain
changes in species distributions across space and time at national and international levels.
MAMBO will result in advances in computer vision and machine listening leading also to
increases in the quality and volume of citizen science species occurrence data. As we
develop   and   adopt   these   new   sensing   technologies,   MAMBO   will   also   develop   the
necessary connections between the models and the data in parallel so that new data can
be effectively used to improve our understanding of the natural world, and so that model
outputs   can   direct   data   collection   efforts   to   fill   geographic   data   gaps.   However,   the
imminent uptake of computer vision and machine listening tools will introduce their own
biases. These may originate in the sensor used, the algorithm selected, or the threshold
used to accept or reject the AI classification. MAMBO will capture these metadata, and
develop modelling approaches that account for these to ensure the best quality inference
from the multiple types of data collected. Further to this, integrated modelling approaches

 
 
Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biоdiversity (MAMBO)

13

will be designed to allow these new data to be used in combination with historical and
future ‘traditional’ datasets to assess long-term changes.

Successfully transferring ecological models in space and time critically depends on the
upscaling ability   of   the   models,   especially   when   local   relationships   between   species
performance and environmental conditions are dependent on a larger-scale biogeographic
context.   By   combining   high-precision   local-scale   data   from   multiple   European   regions,
obtained by demonstrating the MAMBO tools, and respective large-scale environmental
variation, MAMBO will identify the impact of environmental drivers, their interrelations and
in particular their contextdependencies and test the ability and limitations of upscaling and
transferring   ecological   models   in   space   and   time.   Citizen   science   data   often   underpins
models that seek to understand or explain changes in species distributions across space
and time at national and international levels. We see advances in computer vision and
machine listening leading to increases in the quality and volume of citizen science species
occurrence   data.   As   we   develop   and   adopt   these   new   sensing   technologies   we   must
develop the connections between the models and the data in parallel so that new data can
be effectively used to improve our understanding of the natural world, and so that model
outputs can direct data collection efforts to fill data gaps.

Efforts   over   the   last   decade   have   seen   rapid   improvements   in   models   for   detecting
changes in species across time and space, accounting for the ad-hoc nature of citizen
science data (Isaac et al. 2014). These models seek to account for common biases in
citizen   science   data,   such   as   non-random   distribution   in   space   and   time,   changes   in
detectability over time, and variation in sampling effort between site visits. The imminent
uptake of computer vision and machine listening tools will introduce their own biases that
models will need to account for. These may originate in the sensor used, the algorithm
selected, or the threshold used to accept or reject the AI classification. Capturing these
metadata, and developing modelling approaches that account for these is key to ensure
the   best   quality   inference   from   the   data   collected.   Further   to this,   integrated   modelling
approaches must be designed to allow these new data to be used in combination with
historical and future ‘traditional’ datasets to assess changes over long time periods. The
output of models should drive data collection to ensure that new data is collected where it
is needed most. Variations of this approach have long existed in citizen science projects;
identifying areas on a map where data has not been collected, and targeting these for data
collection in the upcoming field season. Recently the DECIDE project has taken this a step
further and uses models to explicitly map uncertainty in species distributions, identifying
accessible locations where new observations by citizen scientists will have the greatest
chance of improving our understanding of species distributions in space. Similar efforts are
being made to best inform changes in species over time (Anonymous 2021). This novel
concept   of   ‘adaptive   citizen   science’   brings   modelling   and   data   collection   into   close
alignment,   each   supporting   the   other   in   near   real-time.   These   new   methods   will   be
important   for   directing   the   deployment   of   sensors   for   autonomous   monitoring   and
demonstrating to citizen scientists the value of the observations they make.

Data available to MAMBO: RS - Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery: A wide range of
RS data can be acquired and are available for use to map and monitor land cover, use,

14

Høye T et al

dynamics and status, landscape features and objects. For habitat type classification and
mapping, Mambo will use data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission that since 2015 has
been   delivering   unique   5day   10-20m   global   multi-spectral   imagery,   and   jointly   with   the
Landsat missions provides the core data source for future national, continental and global
scale   land   cover   mapping   (e.g.   Sentinel-2   Global   Land   Cover   (S2GLC)   http://
s2glc.cbk.waw.pl)   and   monitoring   (e.g.   the   Copernicus   for   Natura2000   http://
www.cop4n2k.eu).

RS - Airborne LiDAR: Across Europe, an increasing number of countries (Denmark, UK,
The   Netherlands,   Finland,   Italy)   are   performing   and   sharing   nation-wide   or   regional
airborne   surveys   with   light   detection   and   ranging   (LiDAR)   technology,   providing   meter
resolution   terrain   and   habitat/vegetation   structure   information.   Some   countries   (e.g.
Denmark and the Netherlands) have already conducted repeated surveys, thus providing
multi-temporal LiDAR data for monitoring biodiversity and habitat change. MAMBO will tap
into the LiDAR repositories of the UK, The Netherlands and Denmark.

RS - Drones: Drones and drone sensor technology are evolving fast and their very high
spatial   resolution   (mm   to   cm)   data   has   the   potential   to   transform   local   site   monitoring.
Various drone-sensor setups exist. MAMBO will focus on the most prolifically used and
affordable rotary drones with red, green, blue and near infrared cameras. When these are
flown to generate high overlap between image frames, structure from motion delivers 3-
dimensional point clouds that are very similar to LiDAR point clouds. MAMBO will use both
the mm/cm 2 and 3-dimensional drone data.

Interdisciplinarity   and   the   integration   of   social   science:   MAMBO   brings   together
natural   scientists   who   are   involved   in   habitat   and   species   conservation   alongside
technology and software specialists to produce tools to help with monitoring, management
and delivery of the habitats directives and species action plans. Social science methods
and principles will be applied throughout MAMBO, most notably in the early stages of the
project in WP1 (User needs and co-development) and towards the end of the project in
WP6 (Synergies, gap-filling and optimisation in a European context). By directly engaging
with national and international stakeholders (Task 1.4, and Task 1.6.) and exploring how
actors interact with one another (Task 1.3.), the project will integrate qualitative research
directly into the testing of novel technologies, identifying challenges and opportunities that
would be missed by technical assessments alone. In addition, we will assess the economic
benefits   of   the   proposed   technology   in   Task   6.4.,   identifying   the   opportunities   these
technologies present for:

•
•
•

reducing the costs of monitoring in the short and long term,
delivering better value for money in achieving conservation objectives and
safeguarding economically valuable biodiversity.

The outputs of this task will include proposals to link monitoring natural capital accounting
projects,   including   the   recent   Eurostat   INCA   system   of   accounts.   Collectively,   this   will
contribute to effective policy and practice at the local, national, and European levels and
help maximise the uptake of the technologies through the project’s lifespan and beyond.

Gender dimension: In MAMBO the gender dimension will be considered in the co-design,
stakeholder   mapping,   and   cost-benefit   analyses.   Co-design:   We   will   ensure   that   user
needs and tool design considers all kinds of gender to make them equally attractive and
intuitive. Stakeholder mapping: Questionnaires and workshop invitations will be screened
for unconscious bias in the language, which can affect the outcome due to gender aspects.
Cost-benefit   analyses:   In   the   context   of   the   cost-benefit   analysis,   we   will   specifically
examine gender differences in the estimates of costs and benefits associated with novel
monitoring tools.

Open Science: MAMBO will address open science practices by making each stage of the
developmental process open and accessible. The open access publishing platform Open
Research Europe (ORE), enabling the beneficiaries of HORIZON Europe to publish their
results   after   a   thorough   examination   and   maximally   open   process,   will   be   explored   for
publishing the completed development stage models and documentation. The project will
also   make   use   of   the   highly   innovative   Open   Access   journal   Research   Ideas   and
Outcomes   (RIO),   where   a   special   Open   Science   Collection   for   MAMBO   is   envisaged
(D7.3). In addition to conventional research papers, the journal welcomes contributions
documenting   the   entire   research   cycle,   including   data,   models,   methods,   workflows,
results, software, perspectives, and policy recommendations. Moreover, a project collection
in   RIO   is   designed   to   feature   all   project   research   outputs   that   have   been   published   in
various journals and/or platforms. The journal only displays the metadata of the article and
the   link   to   the   original   repository,   hence   fully   adhering   to   copyright   regulations.   These
features allow to centrally collect all project outputs and make these available beyond the
project's lifetime.

In order to enforce exploitation, MAMBO will make use of EC’s Horizon Result Platform
(HRP)   -   a   tool   that   enables   important   exploitable   results   to   be   announced   and
disseminated to investors, stakeholders, politicians, potential business partners, etc. the
project   will   use   this   platform   to   publish   the   project’s   Key   Exploitable   Results   (KERs).
Beyond the HRP, MAMBO will get support from the Horizon Results Booster (HRB) to
better exploit the project activities. HRB includes various services, including clustering of
projects for common dissemination, enhanced exploitation plans, business plans for R&I
results   and   commercialisation   services   for   the   more   mature   results.   Communication   to
society at large using social media and easy to digest practice abstracts will be used to
make the science accessible for non-scientists.

Data   management:   To   coordinate   data   management   within   the   project,   MAMBO   will
develop a guiding Data Management Plan (DMP) (D8.3), detailing what data the project
will generate, whether and how it will be exploited or made accessible for verification and
re-use,   and   how   it   will   be   curated   and   preserved.   The   DMP   will   support   the   data
management life cycle for all data that will be collected, processed or generated by the

18

Høye T et al

project.   The   DMP   will   be   prepared   in   accordance   with   the   guidelines   on   FAIR   Data
Management in Horizon Europe.

The DMP will specifically cover:

•

•

•

•

•

Data types generated and their standards: MAMBO will generate a large amount of
data of various types including images, data, code, software, and algorithms. These
will be held by MAMBO partners but will adhere to the MAMBO policies, including
archiving and preservation policy (see below). MAMBO tools and data will adhere
to set data standards (e.g. DANS) and based on activities and funding to WP2 will
strive to be Accessible and Interoperable.
Datasets description: The DMP will provide the dataset metadata specification that
will   be   used   in   the   data   registry,   following   an   appropriate   standard   (e.g.   http://
www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards).   In   the   cases   where   the   datasets
cannot   be   publicly   shared,   the   reasons   will   be   mentioned   in   its   metadata
description (e.g. ethical, rules of personal data, intellectual property, commercial,
privacy-related,   security-related).   This   will   guarantee   that   MAMBO   data   will   be
Findable.
Data sharing policies: These include policies for both newly generated data and
data and knowledge existing among the MAMBO partners or external parties to be
used in MAMBO. The DMP will outline how data can be exploited, shared, or made
accessible for verification and re-use. Explanation of policies will be an integral part
of MAMBO annual meetings to facilitate data sharing among MAMBO partners.
Data archiving and preservation: Partners will be responsible for the preservation of
raw data, final products will be stored in repositories maintained by the partners or
open repositories (depending on data type).
Open   source   policies:   MAMBO   will   in   principle   favour   open-source   approaches.
Some results, however, may be based on proprietary knowledge and components,
which would not allow for open-source. In such cases, selfcontained parts of the
project modules (including manuals and interfaces) will be made available through
open repositories like GitHub or GitLab if possible to allow for further development
by third parties.

The   HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-02   “Data   and   technologies   for   the   inventory,   fast
identification and monitoring of endangered wildlife and other species groups” call states
four expected outcomes, and we demonstrate how MAMBO meets these in contributing to:

Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biоdiversity (MAMBO)

19

1) Systemic, integrated and (open-)standardised data, knowledge and models on the
conservation   status   and   ecological   requirements   of   species   and   habitats,   with   a
focus on those covered by the Birds and Habitats Directives and IUCN Red List 

Impact:   MAMBO   will   develop   integrated   species   distribution   models   and   habitat   extent
maps at high resolution, with a focus on the species covered by the Birds and Habitats
Directives and IUCN Red List (WPs 4,6). These models and the resulting maps will allow
computing automatically some of the IUCN criteria used to evaluate if a taxon belongs in
an IUCN Red List threatened category (CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, ENDANGERED or
VULNERABLE). Criterion B, in particular, focusing on the geographic range of species and
habitats (B1-Area of occupation or B2-Extent of Occupancy) will be directly computable.
This   automated   approach   to   conservation   status   determination   will   not   replace   the
assessment by experts but will greatly facilitate and accelerate their work. This will allow to
have a quick and recurrent estimate of the status and to identify the species for which there
seems to be an urgent need of more precise assessment and/or revision by the experts.
The high transferability of the models used will also allow an estimation of the status of the
rarest species for which there are not enough observation data available for the standard
procedure.

MAMBO will also develop a deep-learning and remote sensing based habitat type mapping
approach,   applicable   at   local,   national   and   European   scale   (T4.1)   which   will   support
Europe   wide   data   integration   and   standardised   scaling.   MAMBO   will   also   support   the
development   of   standardised   data   and   knowledge   on   habitat   conservation   status   by
developing, and demonstrating common RS derived habitat condition metrics (T4.2; T5.3)
and encouraging future standardised processing of airborne LiDAR and drone data, key
remote   sensing   data   sources   for   condition   monitoring.   Reviewing   the   challenges   of
upscaling LiDAR and Drone data processing and tackling it directly by converting scripts
into interactive computing workflows, and automating workflow deployment (T4.3; T5.3) will
encourage future targeted interventions (investments and focussed efforts) and so speed
up LiDAR and drone data use.

Impact indicators: Impact will be measured in terms of feedback from IUCN. The impact
of   the   RS   based   tools   is   measured   in   the   feedback   from   stakeholders,   interest   in   the
reviews   and   demonstrations   (number   of   webinar   and   workshop   participants   T5.3),   and
script and computing workflows usage (access and development on GitHub).

2)   Bridging   of   taxonomic   and   monitoring   gaps   thanks   to   new   enabling   tools,
technologies, fast identification methodologies and integrated monitoring systems
across Europe on wildlife species 

Impact:   MAMBO   will   result   in   three   key   developments   addressing   taxonomic   and
monitoring gaps:

•
•

developing AI-powered identification based on sound and images,
development of insect camera’s capable of monitoring both diversity and biomass
and

20

Høye T et al

•

creating AI-tools allowing monitoring of vegetation quadrants.

AI based sound and image identification will be made freely available for specialist and
citizen   scientists   throughout   Europe   and   will   include   species   of   EU   Habitats   and   Bird
directive, EU pollinator initiative, EU Red lists and EU Invasive Alien Species. The tools
developed for insect cameras make it possible to deploy these on a larger scale helping to
address questions regarding insect decline, biomass decline (impact on food web) and the
early   detection   of   invasive   and/or   pest   species.   The   tools   for   vegetation   quadrants   will
make monitoring of vegetation more cost-efficient, less dependent on specialists and better
standardized allowing for vegetation quadrant monitoring being applied on a larger scale.
The tools developed in MAMBO are of importance to governmental organisations, NGO’s
and citizen scientists, will be used on a large scale for both plants and animals and will
help to increase the monitoring effort while at the same time reducing the cost.

Impact indicators: The impact of the three key tools developed is measured in their use.
By the end of the project, we will have image and sound recognition available for all above
mentioned groups with at least 30,000 European species included. The algorithms will be
open   access,   the   identification   service   will   be   available   throughout   Europe   and   will   be
incorporated in at least six different national biodiversity portals, and will be used annually
by over 20,000 persons contributing to millions of records on biodiversity. At the end of the
project at least 10 national biodiversity portals are willing to participate in a consortium
aimed at further developing the identification tools. The software tools developed for the
insect cameras (diversity and biomass detection of insects) will at the end of the project be
used in at least 200 cameras in over 5 European countries with the aim to develop a
European wide insect biomass monitoring. The tools for AI-driven analyses of vegetation
quadrants will at the end of the project be freely available and will be used for spin-off
projects in >5 European countries.

3) Models upscaling the results of biodiversity assessments to wider areas, based
on existing datasets of environmental descriptors 

Impact:   MAMBO   will   develop   novel   modelling   approaches   that   integrate   multiple   data
streams   from   various   monitoring   tools   (T6.1)   and   combine   them   with   existing   high-
resolution   environmental   data   and   newly   developed   metrics   of   habitat   condition   (T6.2).
These models will be upscaled to provide information on the distribution, status and trends
of   focal   species   and   entire   communities   (T6.3),   enabling   the   assessment   of   less-well
monitored   species   or   the   identification   of   geographic   monitoring   gaps.   Results   and
underlying   workflows   will   be   provided   to   respective   citizen   science-driven   monitoring
schemes,   such   as   the   European   Butterfly   Monitoring   Scheme   or   the   EU   Pollinator
Monitoring Scheme to allow for adaptive monitoring approaches. Results will also support
local   authorities   inmonitoring   Annex   species   of   the   EU   Habitats   Directives.   The
development   of   the   novel   integrated   modeling   approaches,   together   with   the   upscaling
procedures will also have a considerable impact on the scientific community, by enhancing
our ability to transfer ecological niche models in space and time.

Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biоdiversity (MAMBO)

21

Impact indicators: Improving predictive capacity via better models means publication in
international   peer-reviewed   scientific   press,   where   methodological   advancements   and
respective   results   are   independently   evaluated   and   verified.   Given   the   envisaged
significant improvements in modelling capacity and our consolidated expertise, we expect
ground-breaking   scientific   publications   in   high   impact   journals.   In   addition   to   these
publications,   we   will   further   spread   our   results   and   engage   in   dialogue   via   targeted
conference presentations. To boost this process, we will make our publications broadly
available as open-source and open-data. Scientific impact will be measured by citation
metrics   (Web   of   Science)   and   Altmetrics   (e.g.   coverage   in   blogs,   social   media)   and
presentation   at   majorscientific   conferences.   Uptake   by   national   and   international
monitoring schemes will be assessed by the number of novel monitoring sites.

4) Integrative taxonomy of inventory pollinator species (bees, butterflies, moths and
hoverflies),   soil   fauna   (mites,   springtails,   woodlices,   millipedes   and   earthworms)
and/or other threatened species groups 

Impact: MAMBO forms the linking pin between the large number of partners and initiatives
focussed   on   the   conservation   of   pollinators.   It   will   ensure   that   information   and   tools
generated   as   part   of   the   European   Pollinator   Initiative,   the   EU   Pollinator   Monitoring
Scheme, SPRING (Strengthening Pollinator Recovery through INdicators and monitorinG),
ORBIT and TAXOFLY will be freely accessible at a central location. This will include data
on ecology, distribution, taxonomy (checklists), and identification. The latter will be partly
generated as part of WP3 of MAMBO. In addition, the training data mobilised for the AI-
powered   image   and   sound   recognition   will   be   linked   to   the   system   giving   taxonomist
access   to   100thousands   of   images   identified   by   other   experts   and   thus   facilitating
exchange of taxonomic know-how. A similar infrastructure will be in place for soil fauna and
other   groups   of   EU   conservation   concern.   During   the   project,   MAMBO   will   engaged   in
cooperation   with   HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-01   (European   participation   in   global
biodiversity genomics endeavours) ensuring that molecular data of European species of
conservation concern will be readily accessible. This cooperation is especially important for
soil   organism   as   lack   of   DNA-barcode   data   is   currently   hampering   the   structured
monitoring of these groups.

Impact indicators: Impact will be measured by the completeness of enclosed data, the
amount of data made available and the use of the data. For pollinators the data linked will
consist of at least basic data on ecology, distribution, taxonomy (checklists), the availability
of DNA-data and data of relevance to the identification of butterflies, moths, hoverflies and
bees of all species found in Europe (< 5,700). This will include images of use to taxonomy
and identification of 80 percent of the species based both on field data and collections. For
pollinators, a complete overview of available DNA barcodes will be available with a plan to
fill gaps in addition. We expect at least 1000 people from all European countries accessing
the information available in the portal annually, with user numbers potentially increasing
over time.

2.1.2 MAMBO’s wider impact beyond the lifetime of the project

The main aim of Horizon Europe is to provide the knowledge, tools and infrastructure to
contribute to well-being and prosperity in Europe (and beyond). The Horizon Europe Work
Programme   2021-2022   “Food,   Bioeconomy,   Natural   Resources,   Agriculture   and
Environment” states eight overall expected impacts, which can be summarized under four
impact areas: The work programme wants to:

1.
2.

3.

4.

lead the development of the digital and green transformation of Europe,
restore   Europe’s   ecosystems   and   biodiversity   and   manage   natural   resources
sustainably,
make   Europe   the   first   digitally-enabled   circular,   climate-neutral   and   sustainable
economy, and
all that in a more resilient, inclusive and democratic Europe.

MAMBO will contribute to all four impact areas, but mostly to 1, 2 and 3. Related to aim (1):
MAMBO tools and data will be FAIR and thus contribute to the digital literacy of Europe.
MAMBO will make use of a wealth of data sources (from remote sensing to citizen science
and from global and European to national and local data) and integrate them into tools and
applications that can become the basis of public and private technologies to enable spatial
planning (e.g. biodiversity mapping and recording), wellbeing and health (e.g. identification
of   disease   vectors   and   development   of   green   space),   and   green   growth   (e.g.   tools   for
precision agriculture and monitoring the impact of economic activities). Related to (2): All
MAMBO   tools   will   facilitate   ecological   restoration   as   its   tools   make   monitoring   of   all
biodiversity (species and habitats, with a focus on EU directive targets) easier and more
accurate,   provide   decision-support   for   nature   conservation   and   guidance   of   nature
restoration and development. Related to (3): MAMBO image and sound recognition tools
will facilitate digitally-supported agriculture and economy. For example, chemical-free crop
protection   depends   on   accurate   early   warning   of   looming   pests   and   diseases.   Image-
recognition tools, such as automated insect cameras, will be used to do that. Also, MAMBO
tools can be used to evaluate and monitor the impact of economic activities. Not only their
harmful   effects   (e.g.   habitat   degradation)   but   also   their   positive   contribution   (e.g.
afforestation and restoration). Related to (4): Some MAMBO tools will target citizens as its
end-users and will enable citizens to sense their environment directly. This will increase
citizen   participation   level   (and   influence)   in   environmental,   protection,   health,   and   well-
being areas.

Impact   beyond   the   work   programme:   Biodiversity   and   ecosystem   services   in   a
European and global context are in crisis. One-fifth of the world’s countries are at risk of
their ecosystems collapsing due to the destruction of the environment and ecosystems.
Biodiversity and the ecosystem services that depend upon it face ever greater pressures
due to human activity around the globe. Resolving this involves a standardised and easy-
to-implement, cost-efficient adaptive monitoring. MAMBO addresses these challenges with
a multi-dimensional approach, recognising the need for co-design at all levels. The project
builds on an integration of sciences to deliver a set of monitoring tools to identify the root
challenges in the loss of biodiversity.

Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biоdiversity (MAMBO)

23

MAMBO   will   establish   a   community   of   practice   for   novel   monitoring   technology.   By
networking with like-minded researchers, we will expand the scope of this field, beyond the
main project partners, working towards a global ambition to develop automated biodiversity
monitoring   methods   to   generate   high   temporal   and   spatial   resolution   image   data   for
monitoring species and habitats. Knowledge exchange will be invaluable in breaking down
the barriers between our domains: AI, ecology, citizen science, and engineering. Effective
knowledge   exchange   activities   between   the   MAMBO   partners   and   relevant   stakeholder
communities will take place at regular intervals to ensure user needs are considered at
every stage and the uptake of tools and technologies developed during the project can be
maximised.   The   coordinated   field   trials   across   the   EU   will   help   refine   best   practice
guidelines and will stimulate the community of practice in challenging environments. Trials
of   the   automated   systems   will   be   run   alongside   traditional   sampling   methods   and   will
quantify the relative biases in the datasets from the two methods and assess how data
from   the   two   might   be   combined   in   spatiotemporal   statistical   analyses   of   species
populations. We will quantify the labour and material costs of each approach and assess
the efficiency of various monitoring schemes. A key MAMBO output will be a series of best-
practice guides for species and habitat monitoring using automated methods.

MAMBO is expected to:

•

•

•

•

•

Model   the   complex   interdependencies   between   biology,   and   societal   structures
including   governance   and   community   aspiration,   national   and   local   policy   and
actions, financial requirements and social constraints.
Provide   opportunities   for   new   technological   innovation   to   be   applied   to   the
biodiversity sector that make such landscapes financially sustainable as well as
ecologically stable.
Provide targeted multi-dimensional support in the project to adopt or to co-develop
innovative   solutions   to   biodiversity   challenges,   and   make   these   portfolios   of
monitoring solutions available for future upscaling.
Develop and integrate innovative technologies to underpin, support and enable the
upscaling   of   these   actions   by   providing   tools   to   monitor,   measure   and   enable
decision support, ensuring data is used effectively for the transformative restoration
of biodiversity.
Validate both the tools and the assessment frameworks developed in the project
within the context of the demonstration sites and regions and communicate across
multiple platforms the best practices we have identified.

Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals:

1. Biosphere Dimension: the project will contribute to SDG 15 (Life on Land) by addressing
all targets of this SDG, with an impact on the conservation, restoration and sustainable use
of   terrestrial   and   inland   freshwater   ecosystems   and   their   services,   the   promotion   of
sustainable land use planning, and the restoration of degraded soils. Importantly, MAMBO
will significantly lower the costs for monitoring biodiversity.

24

Høye T et al

2.   Societal   Dimension:   MAMBO   will   contribute   to   SDG   11   (Sustainable   cities).   We   will
impact a) the capacity to ensure sustainable food production by informing the benefits of
implement   resilient   agricultural   practices   for   biodiversity,   b)   the   maintenance   of
ecosystems, strengthening capacity for adaptation to climate change, c) the improvement
of land and soil quality and the status of agrobiodiversity, genetic diversity of seeds and the
crop wild relatives (SDG 2).

3. Economic Dimension: Healthy and resilient ecosystems, characterised by a complete
structural and functional diversity of species, are an essential requirement for economic
resilience.   MAMBO   contributes   to   SDG   8   (economic   growth)   through   technological
innovation   (AI-based   monitoring   equipment   and   tools),   economic   productivity   through
entrepreneurship and job creation (e.g. promoting new start-ups using LiDAR, drone and
Copernicus   EO   data),   and   through   promoting   sustainable   tourism   (in   biodiverse
landscapes).

Contribution to the EU Biodiversity Strategy, European Green Deal and the Habitats
Directive:

1. As part of the European Green Deal, MAMBO results will support the implementation of
the EU Biodiversity Strategy, for all objectives where the inventory of species is a core
aspect. These are related to the following components of the BDS strategy: 2.1 A coherent
network   of   protected   areas.   This   includes   a   truly   coherent   Trans-European   Nature
Network;   setting   up   ecological   corridors   to   prevent   genetic   isolation,   allow   for   species
migration, and maintain and enhance healthy ecosystems; and investments in green and
blue infrastructure. MAMBO will contribute to the aim of Member States to demonstrate
significant progress in legally designating new protected areas and integrating ecological
corridors. On this basis, the Commission will assess by 2024 whether the EU is on track to
meet its 2030 targets or whether stronger actions, including EU legislation, are needed, for
which results of MAMBO could be made available. Also for section 2.2 “An EU Nature
Restoration   Plan:   restoring   ecosystems   across   land   and   sea”,   it   is   of   importance,   in
particular   for   sub-section   2.2.2.   “Bringing   nature   back   to   agricultural   land”,   where   it   is
explicitly stated that farmland birds and insects, particularly pollinators, are key indicators
of the health of agroecosystems and are vital for agricultural production and food security;
and where an aim is to bring back at least 10% of agricultural area under high-diversity
landscape   features.   These   include,   inter   alia,   buffer   strips,   rotational   or   non-rotational
fallow   land,   hedges,   non-productive   trees,   terrace   walls,   and   ponds,   where   modern
methods for the inventory of species as developed in MAMBO can be integrated, also for
section 2.2.10. “Addressing invasive alien species” such methods should be integrated.
MAMBO results can also be used for an improved EU-wide framework for the mapping and
monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services that will be put in place with support
from the EuropaBON project and the Biodiversity Partnership under Horizon Europe. It will
be fully aligned with the future EU Nature Restoration Law, to be proposed in 2021.

2.   For   the   Habitats   Directive   MAMBO   will   enlarge   the   toolbox   for   the   assessment   of
species which are typical for the habitats listed in the Annexes of the Directive or even
listed themselves (like e.g. some butterfly & moth species).

Requirements and potential barriers to expected outcomes 

Stakeholder fatigue, lack of interest or conflicts of interest in participating in MAMBO
activities   may  present   a   risk  to   the   project’s  impact.   MAMBO   will   minimise   this   risk  by
following   EU   guidance   for   stakeholder   engagement   and   co-design   (e.g.   http://spiral-
project.eu/content/documents.html; http://www.biodiversa.org/702). We will provide training
for   local   teams,   introduce   various   ways   for   stakeholder   engagement   and   commitment,
utilise longstanding partnerships across the stakeholder spectrum and develop approaches
accounting for diverse interests, values, benefits and socio-political contexts. Economic
concerns driven by the COVID-19 crisis may still override the interest of local, regional
and   national   actors   in   engaging   with   the   project.   However,   sustainable   development   is
central to the EU Green Deal and requires reconciling biodiversity and economic welfare.
MAMBO will actively support this strategy by demonstrating the direct and indirect values
and innovative implementation of its results. Possible changes in the EU and national
policies can modify the framework within which MAMBO is aiming to achieve impact. We
will continually horizon-scan the MS/EU policy landscape for initiatives that may affect the
project (e.g. new or revised incentives or implementation targets between member states).
MAMBO   views   this   as   a   challenge   and   an   opportunity   to   improve   policy   impact   and
decision-making by providing knowledge and methods for the EC, MS and civil society to
improve designs of species and ecosystem assessments.

2.2   Measures   to   maximise   impact -   Dissemination,   exploitation   and
communication

Purposefully designed dissemination, exploitation, and communication activities are key
components   for   maximising the   impact   of   MAMBO.   The   project   will   ensure   the
effectiveness   of   these   activities   by   developing   a   Dissemination   and   Communication
Strategy   (DCS,   MS7.2),   outlining   the   key   target   groups   and   relevant   messages   and
channels   corresponding   to   the   needs   of   each   group.   A   Plan   for   Exploitation   and
Dissemination of Results (PEDR, D7.2) will be created to incorporate lessons learned and
to strictly define the dissemination and communication measures planned to ensure the
uptake of project innovation. The plans will serve as a management tool for defining how
the project’s progress and results are shared with stakeholders and target audiences. Their
updates   will   include   any   necessary   modification   and   adapt   appropriately   to   project
progress   and   new   circumstances,   including   feedback   from   stakeholders   and   target
audiences.   The   DCS   and   PEDR   will   identify   target   audiences   (‘who’),   project   research
activities, outcomes and the MAMBO monitoring and modelling framework (‘what’), tools
and channels employed (‘how’), and the envisioned timeline for implementation of these
activities (‘when’). All activities have the objective to maximise the short-, medium- and
long-term impact of MAMBO results.

2.2.1 Dissemination

To   maximize   impacts,   MAMBO   will   actively   target
its   dissemination,   exploitation,   and
communication activities to audiences and stakeholders. MAMBO will tailor various uni-

26

Høye T et al

and   bi-directional   dissemination   channels   to   the   needs   of   the   target   stakeholders   and
audiences, eliciting expertise, knowledge, and perceptions from stakeholders as part of the
project’s   co-design   and   engagement   activities.   A   preliminary   mapping   of   dissemination
tools and channels, their target audiences, and relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
is shown in Table 3 and will be refined in the PEDR. To effectively disseminate project
results, specific dissemination tools and channels will be established by the project and
existing channels used by MAMBO consortium participants will be fully exploited. MAMBO
will engage participants to multiply the effects of the project’s social media channels by
using their institutional social media channels. Furthermore, consortium participants will
use their existing networks and develop new links, presenting the project and its results at
relevant events at local, national, and international scales.

highly   innovative   Open   Access   journal   Research   Ideas   and   Outcomes   (RIO),   where   a
special   Open   Science   Collection   for   MAMBO   is   envisaged   (D7.3).   In   addition   to
conventional research papers, the journal welcomes contributions documenting the entire
research   cycle,   including   data,   models,   methods,   workflows,   results,   software,
perspectives,   and   policy   recommendations.   Moreover,   a   project   collection   in   RIO   is
designed   to   feature   all   project   research   outputs   that   have   been   published   in   various
journals and/or platforms. The journal only displays the metadata of the article and the link
to the original repository, hence avoiding any copyright issues. These features allow to
central   collection   of   all   project   outputs   and   make   these   available   beyond   the   project's
lifetime. Furthermore, MAMBO will make use of EC’s Horizon Result Platform (HRP) - a
tool   that   enables   important   exploitable   results   to   be   announced   and   disseminated   to
investors, stakeholders, politicians, potential business partners, etc. The project will use
this platform to publish the project’s Key Exploitable Results (KERs, Table 4). Beyond the
HRP, MAMBO will get support from the Horizon Results Booster (HRB) to better exploit the
project   activities.   HRB   includes   various   services,   including   clustering   of   projects   for
common dissemination, enhanced exploitation plans, business plans for R&I results and
commercialisation services for the more mature results.

2.2.3 Communication

In order to achieve maximum exposure and impact, we will prioritise our communication
channels   based   on   the   ones   that   are   actively   used   by   our   target   audiences.   With   our
professional audiences, our focus will be on establishing two-way communication, whereas
for the general public, we will adopt the “getting our message out there” mantra (mainly
through collaboration with associations and networks, as well as public administration at
regional and local levels).

Internal communication: Communication and document exchange tool MS Teams will be
used as part of a web-enabled communications and learning platform, to create a chat-like
environment that simultaneously eases communication and streamlines information and
access to documents into relevant channels to alleviate workload and stimulate fruitful and
focused   discussions.   It   will   provide   a   place   where   the   MAMBO   project   team   and
collaborators can communicate, share documents and work together. The platform allows
for an easy exchange of messages and calls, hence avoiding the need for unnecessary
email exchanges.

External   communication:   MAMBO's   external   communication   strategies   will   be   bi-
directional, i.e. not only disseminating project outputs to targeted actor groups and the
public   at   large   but   also   eliciting   expertise,   knowledge   and   perceptions   as   part   of   the
project’s engagement activities. The different Communication & dissemination tools and
targets, measures to maximise impact and KPIs are outlined in Table 3.

2.2.4 Management of intellectual property and foreseen protection measures

Knowledge   generated   will   be   managed   in   compliance   with   the   Consortium   Agreement
(CA), which will be signed at the beginning of the project. The CA will address background
and foreground knowledge, ownership, protected third-party components, and protection,
use, and dissemination of results and access rights. The principles are:

•

•

•

•

•

Background   information   and   knowledge   contributed   to   the   project   by   each
participant   will   be   listed   in   the   CA.   When   included   in   the   work   plan,   access   to
background information will be provided royalty-free to other participants for the
implementation of the project’s tasks.
Results shall be owned by the participant who generated them. Each participant will
be   responsible   for   ensuring   the   fulfilment   of   their   obligations   under   the   GA
regarding results by planning with any third parties that could claim rights to them.
Whenever   results   have   been   produced   jointly   by   two   or   more   participants,   the
ownership of the results will be shared among the participants who carried out the
work. The terms of joint ownership, protection, share of ownership, and costs for
possible protection will be agreed upon in writing via a joint ownership agreement.
Each participant will be responsible for examining possibilities to protect results that
may be commercially or industrially exploited. When deciding on protection, the
participant   must   consider   their   own   legitimate   interests   and   the   interests   of   the
other participants. Participants will ensure that adequate steps towards protection
are   taken   prior   to   DEC   activities,   preventing   unapproved   public   disclosure   of
results, models, tools, and data.
Access rights to results will be granted on a royalty-free basis for further research,
and on fair and reasonable conditions if needed for commercial exploitation.

2.3 Summary

A summary of the key elements of the impact section is present in Table 5.

Key elements of the impact section.

SPECIFIC NEEDS 

D & E & C MEASURES

EXPECTED RESULTS

Evidence is mounting of widespread
biodiversity declines across the globe.
This gives a stark warning for the perilous
state of our planet, yet the evidence base
remains biased to a few regions and a few
species groups which are feasible to
monitor. General conclusions on the
status of biodiversity are complex given
their diverse ecologies and high variability
between and within taxon groups, over
time and geographic regions.

Dissemination: By leveraging existing
communication structures, MAMBO will
disseminate key project developments.
Consortium partners will represent the
project at international, national or regional
events, and directly engage with interested
actors. Through demonstration, we will
raise awareness of the potential for using
AI species identification tools, camera
systems, and acoustic sensors for species
monitoring.

Automated tools (AI software for
animalidentification from images and
sound, insectcameras, and image-
based surveys of plant species in
local permanent plots or quadrats) for
speciesmonitoring will have reached a
level of maturity,where they are
reproducible, reliable and havebeen
tested and demonstrated in realistic
settings across the EU.

Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biоdiversity (MAMBO)

31

Repeatable sampling methods that can
automate and expand the extent and
resolution of biodiversity monitoring are
urgently needed to provide robust
estimates of long-term trends. Closing the
knowledge gap has never been more
important.
MAMBO is addressing this challenge
through innovative approaches to develop,
test and deploy modern enabling tools for
monitoring wildlife species and their
habitats.
MAMBO will help to realise the potential of
very high spatial resolution remotely
sensed data (in particular airborne LiDAR,
drone and Sentinel2 data) to support
habitat and biodiversity monitoring.
MAMBO will provide cost-effective, long-
term, and user-friendly solutions to land
managers, member states agencies and
the EEA for monitoring biodiversity and
habitats, and help to evaluate the
conservation status of nature reserves.

A technical workshop will further train and
encourage interested stakeholders to adapt
and use our resulting open source remote
sensing data processing frameworks,
scripts and pipelines. MAMBO will reach
interested professionals through webinars,
scientific publications and mobiliseresearch
journalists.
Exploitation: Open Research Europe
(ORE) and the Open Access journal
Research Ideas and Outcomes (RIO) will
be used to ensure effective exploitation of
project results and availability beyond
MAMBO’s lifetime The project’s Key
Exploitable Results (KERs) will be
published on EC’s Horizon Result Platform
(HRP). Beyond the HRP, MAMBO will get
support from the Horizon Results Booster
(HRB) to better exploit the project activities.
We will provision open access data by
making MAMBO data and tools FAIR.
Communication: Online activities will use
the website as a hub and a repository for all
public information on the project, supported
by the use of social media channels
(Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube).

MAMBO will identify metrics and
indicators thatcan be commonly used
across Europe for habitatcondition
monitoring, measurable with
remotesensing. MAMBO will further
advance knowledge on how to take
up LiDAR and drone data for
operational habitat monitoring,
specifically in habitats prioritised for
conservation action (e.g. grasslands,
wetlands). MAMBO will also develop,
test and share remotely sensed
based methods for mapping habitat
extent, using in-situ observations,
deep learning and EO data from
Copernicus.
MAMBO will contribute to developing
a framework for integrating data from
new and existing biodiversity data
streams into the future European
system of biodiversity monitoring
(EuropaBON), thus providing the next
generation of biodiversity indicators
needed to measure progress in
tackling the biodiversity crisis.

TARGET GROUPS 

OUTCOMES 

IMPACTS 

European Commission, particularly DG
Environment for the implementation of the
Biodiversity Strategy (see WP 7.5), and
the ECKnowledge Centre for Biodiversity
(KCBD) regarding data and knowledge.
EU-level assessments made by the
European Environmental Agency(EEA)
through its European Topic Centre on
Biological Diversity (ETC-BD). National,
regional and local level policy and
decision makers, incl. environmental
agencies and ministries of member states
with responsibility for reporting to the Birds
and Habitats Directives. Land managers
and land owners (e.g. inside and outside
Natura 2000 sites). Non-governmental
organisations - e.g. IUCN.Existing
monitoring schemes (e.g. eBMS,
EUPoMS, SPRING, EuMon). Ecologists
and biodiversity scientists working on
bioacoustics and AI based image
recognition. Domain scientists developing
scripts and analysis tools for mapping and
monitoring habitat extent and condition.
eScience engineers and developers of
virtual research infrastructures with focus
on biodiversity, ecosystems and the
environment (e.g. LifeWatch, ENVRI).
Citizen science communities.

We expect that the technical developments
and research networks developed and
strengthened through MAMBO will help
maximise the potential for a revolution in
the scope and capacity for monitoring
species and habitats,especially those for
which knowledge gaps still exist, and
crucial elements of ecosystems that
humans depend on. We expect to see a
widespread uptake of remote sensing
technology for habitat monitoring, in
particular LiDAR, drone and Sentinel-2
data. We expect an increase in LiDAR and
drone data sharing and use triggered by
the adoption of standard practices and
harmonized protocols for data acquisition,
pre-processing and storage. We expect
that our best practice guide for insect
monitoring using automated sensors,
deeplearning and computer vision will
accelerate and standardise the adoption of
this exciting new technology. We believe
that MAMBO will play an important role in
the rise of deeplearning and computer
vision in transforming ecological research
to address the global challenge of insect
declines.

It thus supports the implementation of
the Green Deal, the EU biodiversity
strategy 2030 and the Birds and
Habitats Directives, and will contribute
to the Commission's new governance
framework for biodiversity under the
future EU Nature Restoration Law.
MAMBO will deliver new ways of
monitoring species and habitats via
automated (sound and image)
recognition and remote sensing
(drones, LiDAR, satellite). Reliable
data on the natural environment is
fundamental to support science on
species conservation in human-
modified landscapes. We will make a
substantive contribution to
understanding climate change and
land-use impacts on biodiversity and
advise beneficiaries at global (e.g.
IUCN, IPBES, IPCC), regional (e.g.
EU, EEA) and national levels
(reporting of member states).

3. Quality and efficiency of the implementation

3.1 Work plan and resources

MAMBO is organised into eight work packages (WPs) grouped along three main pillars
(Fig. 3). WP1 and WP2 aim to engage users into the co-design process and link the tools
and data streams to existing infrastructures, respectively. WP3 and WP4 will develop new
and enhance existing tools for monitoring species and habitats, respectively. WP5, WP6,
and WP7, will ensure that these tools are demonstrated to relevant user groups, which the
data streams are integrated with existing monitoring and that results are disseminated and
taken up by policy makers. WP8 will ensure efficient coordination across and beyond this
truly interdisciplinary project.

The   project   period   duration   of   MAMBO   is   48   months   and   the   timeline   of   the   work   in
individual WPs and tasks is indicated in the GANTT chart in Fig. 4.

Figure 3. 

The three main pillars of activity in MAMBO and the underlying work packages.

3.2 Capacity of participants and consortium as a whole

The   MAMBO   consortium   brings   together   key   global   research   leaders   related   to   the
monitoring of species and habitats as is evident from Table 2 individually, these partners
represent major strengths which are elaborated below. Many partners have an excellent
track   record   of   numerous   past   collaborations   in   large-scale   projects   and   are   known   to
complement each other in areas such as stakeholder involvement, biological monitoring,
citizen science, and science policy integration. MAMBO connects these key elements of
expertise with leaders in cutting-edge biodiversity monitoring technology from the plot to

The   Helmholtz   Centre   for   Environmental   Research   -   UFZ,   is   the   only   centre   in   the
Helmholtz   Association   to   be   exclusively   devoted   to   environmental   research   in   a   great
variety of fields. The UFZ has become a worldwide acknowledged centre of expertise in
integrated   and   interdisciplinary   environmental   research   and   in   the   development   of
sustainable   land   management   strategies.   UFZ   has   a   strong   focus   on   methodological
advancements   in   the   modelling   and   simulation   of   environmental   systems,   both   in
fundamental and applied research. UFZ is and was participating in more than 90 Projects
funded within FP7 and Horizon 2020, 34 of them coordinated by UFZ (collaborative and
individual projects). UFZ is or was the host for 3 ERC grants and is leading the European
Topic Centre on Inland, Coastal and Marine waters (ETC/ICM) funded by the European
Environment   Agency   (EEA)   since   2014.   For   MAMBO,   UFZ   will   provide   its   expertise   in
merging   animal   and   plant   ecology,   and   population,   community   and   macroecology   to
develop scientific principles to explain functional relationships across organisational levels
and spatio-temporal scales, in particular for the integration envisaged in the lead of WP6.
In   order   to   make   our   research   policy   relevant,   the   UFZ   team   is   heavily   involved   in
international,   especially   intergovernmental,   assessments   (IPBES,   IPCC)   as   well   as
scientific communication and outreach, which makes it a natural candidate to lead WP7.

The French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) is a
public   industrial   and   commercial   enterprise   joint   authority   of   the   Ministry   of   Higher
Education and Research and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which bases its operations on
development needs, from field to laboratory and from a local to a global scale. CIRAD
plays   a   major   role   in   the   aim   to   generate   and   pass   on   new   knowledge   and   support
agricultural   development   and   biodiversity   conservation,   with   activities   involving   the   life,
social   and   engineering   sciences   applied   to   agriculture,   biodiversity   and   rural   territories.
During the MAMBO project, CIRAD will leverage its strong expertise in the development of
innovative tools for plant identification, in a multitude of contexts, including protected or
endangered plant species. CIRAD team involved in MAMBO is affiliated with the Univ. of
Montpellier, which has been in the Top 3 of the Shanghai World University Ranking for
Ecology for 5 years (2017-2021). Due to its experience in global agro-biodiversity analysis,
management   and   conservation,   its   involvement   in   the   coordination   of   large-scale   ICT
projects, such as the Pl@ntNet citizen science platform, and its good understanding of the
EU biodiversity policies (with its involvement in more than 100 European projects), CIRAD
will coordinate the WP5 of MAMBO, ensuring the equipment and demonstration on sites
and in targeted regions. CIRAD will also develop new approaches for the identification of
species communities (Task T3.4), and make use of its capacities and network for wide
dissemination and valorization of the developed results.

with Rikola hyper spectral sensor 500-900nm; DJI M300 with L1 Lidar, P1 photogrammetry
grade RGB, and Micasense RGBNIR sensor. UKCEH will be part of the consortium as an
associated Partner, with national funding from UKRI.

4. Ethics self-assessment

The MAMBO project will employ quantitative as well as qualitative methods to collect and
process data. Specifically, MAMBO includes a range of qualitative methods (stakeholders,
audiences, interviews, workshops, meetings, focus groups, digital tools) and data collection
through quantitative methodologies (surveys, interviews and document reviews). MAMBO
will involve policymakers, decision-makers, and stakeholders in the development of the
tools and impact plans. MAMBO will develop best practices, tools, governance options and
guidelines to support national and international biodiversity in the EU. The storage and
handling   of   data   will   happen   in   ways   that   as   far   as   possible   eliminate   the   risk   of
confidentiality breaches, comply with legislation on data in the respective countries, and
conform to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR). Moreover, to live up to the
principles   of   reliability,   honesty,   respect   and   accountability   in   the   European   Code   of
Conduct for Research Integrity (ALLEA 2017), we will throughout the project ensure these
operational steps:

•

•
•

•

Make all data publicly available after the anonymisation of all direct and indirect
identifiers.
Make succinct study protocols for each empirical WP.
Send the protocols for ethical review to the Steering board, whenever personal data
is involved.
Before data collection, pre-register our study at i.e. OSF (www.osf.io).

The research outlined in the MAMBO project does not intend to involve the collection of
sensitive information. It could be anticipated, however, that informants' responses to any
open questions in the study or deliberations through groups by the digital tools, or similar
settings might, unintended, reveal sensitive information. Such potential situations will be
anticipated in the study protocols and will be submitted for ethical assessment.

Compliance with ethical principles and relevant legislation 

Before   the   commencement   of   the   research   activities   involving   human   participants,   the
relevant WP leader in collaboration with the Steering Board will ensure that the research
practices are in line with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, national
and   organisational   Research   Ethics   and   Integrity   Policies,   and   the   operational   steps
presented   in   bullet   points   above.   The   study   protocol   will   account   for   all   ethical   issues
related to research involving human participants. It will form the basis for the selection and
recruitment of participants. This includes the number of participants, inclusion/exclusion
criteria and direct/indirect incentives for participation. A cover letter will be communicated to

38

all participants and thereby ensure that all informants and respondents are duly informed
about   the   scope   and   purposes   of   their   involvement   and   the   research   activities   of   the
project.   Moreover,   all   human   participants   will   be   ensured   anonymity   and   confidentiality
when appropriate. Procedures for informed consent will be strictly maintained, and copies
of Informed Consent Forms and Information Sheets will be prepared, duly signed, and
preserved.   These   will   be   concise   and   in   language   and   terms   understandable   to   the
participants. Participants will have the right:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

To know that participation is voluntary.
To ask questions and receive understandable answers before making a decision,
To know the degree of risk and burden involved in participation.
To know who will benefit from participation.
To know the procedures that will be implemented in the case of incidental findings.
To withdraw themselves, their samples and data from the project at any time.
To know of any potential commercial exploitation of the research.

'Personal data' is understood as data about an individual who can be identified from that
data or from related information. The project partners will respect and strictly adhere to
national and international regulations and laws while conducting research involving human
participants   and   when   collecting   and   processing   their   personal   data.   In   particular,   the
partners will respect and strictly abide by the ethical principles expressed in:

•
•

•

Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data.
Directive 2002/58 on Privacy and Electronic Communications.

The project will be designed according to the Data Protection Act which was approved by
the EU Commission and Council in April 2016 and came into effect in 2018. Based on this
new regulation   the   data   protection   of   the   project   will   furthermore   include   the   following
issues:

•
•
•
•

Access to own data and right to be removed.
Informing about hacking.
The use of data for public interest and profiling.
Privacy by design.

Responsibilities of the controller and the processor 

In the context of the MAMBO project, which will collect personal data and also provide
open   access   to   data   generated   as   part   of   the   research   project,   it   is   crucial   to   ensure
concise   procedures   for   deleting   personal   identifiers   before   offering   open   access.
Responsibilities between the controller of the data and the processor of the data will be
clearly defined in the Data Management Plan developed in the early phases of the project.
While the project does not expect to collect sensitive data, it is nonetheless important to
implement strict procedures for safeguarding anonymity whenever relevant. All data from
either individual or social interactions will be dealt with on the basis of two main principles:

informed consent and privacy. Photographs, audio and video recordings are personal data
and will be handled as such. Participants will be informed at the beginning of interviews or
group discussions that video or tape recordings will be used, and they will have the option
to agree or to decline. The Consortium will be supported by an external independent ethics
advisor in order to be advised in i) the activities involving the collection and/or processing
of personal data for supporting the Consortium in dealing with them in compliance with the
GDPR,   the   national   legislation   and   the   HE   ethical   standards;   ii)   the   identification   and
thorough analysis of the ethics issues raised in the demonstration sites; iii) the measures
that will be taken to mitigate such risks and to ensure compliance with the ethics standards
of Horizon Europe. The external independent Ethics Advisor must be appointed by month
6, and the frequency of reports: once at the end of each reporting period.
