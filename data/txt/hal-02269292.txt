ABSTRACT 
Smart disclosure initiatives and new regulations such as GDPR in 
the  EU  increase  the  interest  for  Personal  Data  Management 
Systems  (PDMS)  being  provided  to  individuals  to  preserve  their 
entire digital life. Consequently, the thorny issue of data security 
becomes  more  and  more  prominent,  but  highly  differs  from 
traditional  privacy  issues  in  outsourced  corporate  databases. 
Concurrently, the emergence of Trusted Execution Environments 
(TEE) changes the game in privacy-preserving data management 
with novel security models. This tutorial offers a global perspective 
of the current state of work at the confluence of these two rapidly 
growing  areas.  The  goal  is  threefold:  (1)  review  and  categorize 
PDMS  solutions  and  identify  existing  privacy  threats  and 
countermeasures; (2) review new security  models capitalizing on 
TEEs  and  related  privacy-preserving  data  management  solutions 
relevant to the personal context; (3) discuss new challenges at the 
intersection of PDMS security and TEE-based data management. 

1.  INTRODUCTION 
As  Tim  Berners  Lee  himself  advocates  [40],  time  has  come  “to 
restore  the  power  and agency  of  individuals  on  the  web”.  Smart 
disclosure initiatives (e.g., Blue Button [49] in the US, MiData [50] 
in  UK,  MesInfos  [48]  in  France)  and  new  privacy-protection 
regulations (e.g., GDPR in Europe [15]) allow individuals to freely 
retrieve  their  personal  data  from  companies  and  administrations 
hosting them. Hence, individuals can now gather their full digital 
environment in a Personal Data Management Systems (PDMS) [4], 
also  called Personal  Cloud or Personal  Information  Management 
System [1], Personal Data Server [2] or Personal Data Store [12]. 
A  PDMS  not  only  stores  data  from  many  (previously)  isolated 
information  silos  (e.g.,  secondary  copies  of  data  issued  by  their 
bank, employer, supermarket) but also primary data (e.g., produced 
by quantified-self devices and smart meters, photos or documents). 
This unprecedented concentration of personal data opens the way 
for  new  value-added  services  when  crossing  multiple  data  of  a 
given person (e.g., crossing bank statements with shopping history) 
or  crossing  data  of  multiple  individuals  (e.g.,  conducting  an 
epidemiological study), under the concerned individuals’ control. 

tackle  such 

These perspectives should not eclipse the security issues raised by 
the PDMS paradigm given the sensitivity and quantity of managed 
personal  data.  Several  products  (e.g.,  [39–50])  and  research 
initiatives on PDMS (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 12, 17, 25, 37]) are riding this 
wave. While PDMS have been studied and developed for more than 
a  decade,  the  proposed  solutions  provide  diverse  sets  of 
functionalities and consider diverse threat models.  
An important point is that in a PDMS-like context the threat models 
differ significantly from the traditional corporate DBMS context. 
In  particular,  one  must  consider  partially  compromised  user 
systems  and  a  large  number  of  individuals  collaborating  for 
performing  distributed  computations,  not  all  of  them  honest. 
Moreover,  one  cannot  rely  on  security  conscious,  expert 
administrators to set up the system and ensure that only trustworthy 
computations  are  performed.  While  using  secure  hardware  to 
secure databases is hardly a new direction [7, 9], most approaches 
do  not 
recent 
democratization  of  TEEs,  several  works  have  focused  on  new 
security models where trust lies on the hardware rather than on the 
user  environment  [13,  29,  34]  and  solutions  [16,  28]  have  been 
designed  for  secure  data  management  against  new  threat  models 
(e.g.,  distributing  trust  between  many  computation  nodes  and 
considering corrupted user environments). Although most of these 
solutions do not focus on personal data management, the proposed 
trust  models  and  associated  solution  represent  an  important  step 
towards suitable threat models for the PDMS.  
This tutorial is at the crossroads of personal database security and 
TEE-based data management. It first reviews and categorizes the 
various  PDMS  alternatives  in  terms  of  provided  functionalities, 
targeted threat models, trust models and security countermeasures 
(see  Figure  1,  Part 1).  It  then  presents  existing  approaches  for 
secure  (distributed)  data  management  focusing  on  TEE-based 
solutions (Part 2). Conclusions drawn from Parts 1 and 2 allow us 
to  define  an  abstract  architecture  for  an  extensive  and  secure 
PDMS, and sketch important open research issues.

2.  DETAILED TUTORIAL OUTLINE 
This tutorial consists of three parts having similar length detailed 
in the next subsections. 

2.1  Personal Data Management Systems 
In the first part of the tutorial, we review, compare and categorize, 
academic PDMS proposals [1, 2, 3, 12, 17, 19, 25, 32, 33, 37] and 
industrial  products  representative  of  the  current  PDMS  offer 
(CozyCloud [39], Inrupt [40], MyDex [41], Digi.me [42], Meeco 
[43],  BitsAbout.Me  [44],  Perkeep  [45],  CloudLocker  [46], 
MyCloud [47]). We also consider products targeting data storage 
and synchronization for personal applications like SpiderOak [11] 
which are related to PDMS. This review is driven by the analysis 
of  provided  functionalities  with  respect  to  the  targeted  trust  and 
security  models.  Using  this  analysis,  we  classify  the  solutions 
according  to  their  architecture  (and  hence  threat  models  and 
security  solutions) 
five  categories  covering  different 
functionalities with sometimes irreconcilable security approaches: 
online PDMS (e.g., [39, 43]), zero-knowledge solutions (e.g., [11, 
41]),  home-cloud  software  (e.g., [12,  17, 37]),  home  cloud plugs 
(e.g., [46, 47]) and tamper-resistant versions (e.g., [22]).

Figure 1: Organization of the Tutorial 
Interesting  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  this  state-of-the-art 
analysis. Regarding the functionality aspect, the whole life-cycle 
of personal data is targeted overall. However, taken individually, 
the  solutions  only  tackle  some  stages  of  the  life-cycle:  data 
collection, 
storage,  backup,  cross-computations  or  data 
computations 
dissemination. 
functionalities are only supported by very few proposals even 
the  way  for  Big  Data 
though  such  functionalities  pave 
computations  with  many 
context 
(recommendations, participative studies, training a neural network 
in patient communities, etc.). Notably, works addressing this step 
investigate solutions based on privacy preserving home cloud [28, 
37] where data is under users’ control at the edge of the network. 
On  the  trust  and  security  side,  a  first  conclusion  is  that,  all  the 
privacy threats addressed in the state-of-the-art solutions make 
sense in the PDMS context to protect user’s privacy and security 
in  a  meaningful  way,  from  data  snooping  and  secondary  uses 
performed by cloud providers (e.g., data monetization) to corrupted 
applications or client devices (e.g., ransomware) to cite only a few. 
However,  these  threats  are  unequally  covered  by  the  considered 
PDMS architectures. More, a second (negative) conclusion is that 
unifying  the  proposed  countermeasures  does  not  lead  to  a 
secure PDMS architecture, mainly because building the union of 

this 

in 

the  proposals  would  undeniably  face  irreconcilable  architectural 
choices,  with  different  and  sometimes  contradictory  security 
measures  and  functionalities  depending  on  the  considered  threat 
model.  For  example,  combining  a  zero-knowledge  encrypted 
storage with an online PDMS offering data-oriented computation 
functionalities would require returning all the individual’s data to 
the client side and hence put it at risk.  
To conclude this part, we derive the extensible set of functionalities 
to be implemented in a PDMS to cover the complete data life-cycle 
and  list  the  privacy  threats  the  PDMS  must  circumvent  to  be 
deemed  secure.  For  each  functionality,  we  identify  its  main 
specificities  and  highlight  the  way  it  differs  from  corporate  data 
management systems from a security point of view.  
2.2  TEE-based Data Management 
A majority of the works on secure database computations focus on 
outsourcing  corporate  databases  to  honest-but-curious  cloud 
services to manage large sets of sensitive data. In this part of the 
tutorial, we first state the problem of extensible and secure PDMS 
as  a  ‘mutual  trust’  problem  (i.e.,  where  data  and  query 
confidentiality  and  integrity  should  be  guaranteed  to  both  the 
individuals  managing  their  own  data  and  third  parties  accessing 
shared  data  or  query  results)  and  position  the  main  privacy-
preserving database technologies in relation to this issue.  
We then briefly introduce the TEE technology and the three main 
security  properties  it  provides:  (1)  isolation:  TEEs  isolate  the 
environment (including the OS) for the code it runs, which means 
that an attacker controlling the environment (even with root access) 
cannot influence the behavior of code executed within the TEE; (2) 
a 
confidentiality:  TEEs  provide 
compromised  user/OS,  ensuring  that  private  data  handled  by  the 
TEE may never be observed, except through explicit input/output 
of the code running inside a TEE; and (3) attestation: TEEs provide 
an attestation mechanism that allows the code running inside a TEE 
to  prove  its  identity  and  provide  guarantees  that  the  result  it 
produced was indeed obtained with that code. While TEEs aim at 
providing  unconditional  protection  to  the  executed  programs,  a 
motivated  attacker  may  still  be  able  to  perform  so  called  side-
channel  attacks  to  gain  information  on  the  data  processed  inside 
TEEs [30, 36], leading to consider counter measures to protect –to 
some extent– against such attacks.  
In this context, the first crucial threat for personal data management 
is a potentially compromised user system or mismanagement of the 
said system by a non-expert user. To this end, we investigate the 
TEE based existing solutions for securing a DBMS, as protecting a 
user ‘from himself’ is closely related to protecting a system against 
a  corrupt  system  administrator.  We  first  review  the  database 
computing techniques deploying secure  hardware at  the database 
server  side  [6,  7,  9].  Most  techniques  basically  split  the  query 
processing in one part executed directly on the encrypted data and 
the other executed inside the secure hardware on cleartext data and 
make  the  processing  oblivious  to  prevent  adversary  learning 
anything from the data access pattern. Besides, we analyze recent 
Intel SGX-based database initiatives, with a focus on works where 
the security relies on a unique DBMS controller running in a single 
SGX  enclave.  We  start  from  the  implementation  of  very  simple 
DBMS  stores  in  SGX  such  as  a  key-value  store  [31],  and  then 
review  proposal  for  performing  advanced  database  operations  in 
SGX, from secure indexing like HardIDX and Oblix [16, 24], to 
proposal  dedicated  to  protect  data  access  patterns  analysis  like 
ObliDB [14], up to the execution of an entire DBMS engine in SGX 
like EnclaveDB [28].

The  second  crucial  issue  is  enabling  mutually  trusted  data 
management between PDMS users and third parties in a distributed 
database  setting.  Emerging  TEE-based  solutions  address  the 
problem  of  outsourcing  distributed  computations  in  the  cloud, 
leveraging TEEs for integrity and privacy guarantees. For example, 
[13,  27,  29]  offer  secure  map-reduce  frameworks  using  Intel’s 
SGX, [26] proposes a machine learning framework and [38] offers 
a Spark SQL framework. These works do not tackle the problem of 
distributing trust between users, but they (at least partially) address 
the  problem  of  obtaining  integrity  and  security  of  computations 
over multiple TEEs, and can be viewed as a necessary step in this 
direction. We then focus on an initial line of work [8, 18] which 
consists  in  leveraging  TEEs  for  distributing  trust  between  actors 
during a distributed computation.  
2.3  Reference Architecture and Challenges 
Finally, we draw conclusions from the first two parts and show how 
one could leverage existing TEE-based solutions at various levels 
to  address  the  specific  threats  associated  with  personal  data 
management.  We  then  derive  a  reference  architecture  for  a  TEE 
based PDMS. A first important challenge linked to the design of 
such a PDMS architecture is rooted in the tension between PDMS 
security, rich data processing and mutual trust. Few recent works 
go  into  this  direction.  [4]  envisions  a  minimal  Secure  Core 
implementing  a  basic  set  of  operations,  extended  with  richer but 
untrusted  data  processing  operators  implemented  in  TEEs.  We 
further illustrate the database challenges in the case of collective or 
distributed  queries  and  focus  on  the  problem  of  concretely 
implementing distributed data processing without leaks and using 
TEEs  to  propagate  trust  between  a  large  number  of  users 
contributing to a common processing task. We review here a few 
initial  proposals  applied  to  specific  privacy  preserving  database 
computations with dataflow control [3, 20, 21, 23, 32]. 
Several other challenges  relate to the control tools enabling non-
expert users to effectively regulate the dissemination and usage of 
their data. While preliminary works exist regarding access control 
enforcement with TEEs [10, 35], much is left to do to tackle usage 
control. Finally, the reciprocal entanglements between economic, 
legal,  societal  and 
technological  aspects  of  personal  data 
management also constitute major concerns. 
3.  TUTORIAL OUTCOME 
This  tutorial  is  devoted  to  a  large  audience,  from  industrials 
involved  in  personal  data  management,  to  researchers  and 
computer scientists working on data management and data security 
issues. We expect the audience to gain a better perception of the 
fundamental security properties needed at each step of the personal 
data  life-cycle,  helping  to  identify  hidden  flaws  linked  to 
architectural choices. The public can also get a broad view of the 
PDMS  landscape  and  obtain  an  insight  of  the  main  research 
challenges  linked  to  secure  personal  data  management  and  the 
impact  of  recent  TEE  research  on  these  challenges.  Finally,  we 
hope this tutorial will help the audience perceive how architectural 
choices in the personal data domain disrupt established principles 
of accountability between platform providers, data controllers and 
individuals.
