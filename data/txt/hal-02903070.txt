Abstract

Shoot architecture is a key component of the interactions between plants and their environment. We present a novel 
model of grass, which fully integrates shoot morphogenesis and the metabolism of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at 
organ scale, within a three-dimensional representation of plant architecture. Plant morphogenesis is seen as a self-
regulated system driven by two main mechanisms. First, the rate of organ extension and the establishment of architec-
tural traits are regulated by concentrations of C and N metabolites in the growth zones and the temperature. Second, 
the timing of extension is regulated by rules coordinating successive phytomers instead of a thermal time schedule. 
Local concentrations are calculated from a model of C and N metabolism at organ scale. The three-dimensional rep-
resentation allows the accurate calculation of light and temperature distribution within the architecture. The model 
was calibrated for wheat (Triticum aestivum) and evaluated for early vegetative stages. This approach allowed the 
simulation of realistic patterns of leaf dimensions, extension dynamics, and organ mass and composition. The model 
simulated, as emergent properties, plant and agronomic traits. Metabolic activities of growing leaves were investi-
gated in relation to whole-plant functioning and environmental conditions. The current model is an important step 
towards a better understanding of the plasticity of plant phenotype in different environments.

Introduction

Reconciling  productivity  and  sustainability  in  the  context 
of global change is a critical challenge that agriculture has 
to  face.  Mechanistic  models  can  explore  plant  behaviour 
in  present  and  future  climates,  thus  allowing  investigation 
of  the  benefits  and  drawbacks  of  novel  crop  management 
as  well  as  the  identification  of  plant  traits  that  can  be  po-
tential  targets  for  plant  breeding.  For  this  purpose,  models 
should  provide  a  holistic  view  of  whole-plant  functioning 
by integrating the interactions between environmental fac-
tors,  morphogenesis,  and  source–sink  activities  within  the 
plant.  Functional–structural  plant  models  (FSPMs)  have 
opened  up  possibilities  to  account  for  these  plant–envir-
onment interactions through a realistic description of indi-
vidual  plant  architecture  (Prusinkiewicz,  1998;  Godin  and 
Sinoquet, 2005). Using an explicit representation of the in-
dividual variability and heterogeneity of resource availability, 
this approach provides a framework for understanding and 
integrating the mechanisms of plant competition and growth 
in  a  large  range  of  agronomic  situations  (Vos  et  al.,  2010; 
DeJong et al., 2011; Barillot et al., 2014; Sievänen et al., 2014; 
Gaudio et al., 2019). FSPMs are based on a broad diversity of 
paradigms, ranging from empirical descriptions of growth to 
process-based approaches accounting for the trophic status 
of plants. Among the latter, most crop FSPMs consider only 
carbon (C) and are based on a supply:demand approach, in 
which  resource  allocation  among  organs  is  driven  by  sink 
priorities  defined  from  empirical  relations.  Only  a  few 
models address the question of supply feedbacks on demand 
size (Luquet et al., 2006), and key nutrients such as nitrogen 
(N) and water are rarely considered (Bertheloot et al., 2011; 
Lobet et al., 2014; Coussement et al., 2018). For the sake of 
simplicity, existing models use as inputs key traits, which are 
actually emerging properties of plant functioning and vary 
with growth conditions. For example, since the rate of shoot 
development is relatively stable in thermal time (McMaster, 
2005), most models have a phyllochron parameter to drive 
the  duration  of  leaf  elongation,  while  it  has  been  shown 
that phyllochron may increase with C, N, or water stresses 
(Cutforth et al., 1992;  Longnecker et al., 1993;  Muller and 
Martre,  2019).  From  a  mechanistic  point  of  view,  leaf  ex-
tension  drives  the  phyllochron  rather  than  the  opposite. 
Another example is the relationship between leaf mass and 
dimension, commonly included in models by using a con-
stant specific leaf area (SLA), while SLA may in fact strongly 
vary  between  environments  (Rawson  et  al.,  1987; Tardieu 
et al., 1999;  Poorter et al., 2009). Such approximations can 
lead  to  large  errors  in  the  predictions  of  plant  surface  or 
biomass  production.  Finally,  as  pointed  out  in  the  review 
of Poorter et al. (2013), we still lack mechanistic modelling 
approaches simulating whole-plant functioning and trait ac-
quisition  as  properties  arising  from  the  feedbacks  between 
morphogenesis, environmental factors, and source–sink ac-
tivities within the plant.

For  grasses,  leaf  growth  has  been  extensively  studied  in 
terms of (i) histology, (ii) coordination between the elong-
ation of successive leaves, and (iii) regulation by the trophic 

status. The  growth  zone  is  located  at  the  leaf  base,  inside 
the pseudostem made of previous sheaths (Begg and Wright, 
1962), where cells move through division, elongation-only, 
and mature zones (Williams, 1975; Skinner and Nelson, 1995; 
Durand et al., 1999). The length of the zone hidden in the 
pseudostem strongly influences the elongation of the growing 
leaf and also impacts the following leaves. Synchronies be-
tween emergence events out of the pseudostem and major 
changes in the kinetics of leaf elongation have been repeat-
edly  documented  and  formalized  as  coordination  rules  in 
models to account for a self-regulation of plant architecture 
(Durand  et  al.,  1998;  Fournier  et  al.,  2005; Verdenal  et  al., 
2008;  Zhu et al., 2014; Vidal and Andrieu, 2019). Finally, a 
large number of studies have demonstrated the plasticity of 
leaf dimensions and the correlation of this plasticity with C 
and N content in the growth zone through an effect on the 
rate of cell division and/or elongation (Kemp, 1980; Volenec 
and  Nelson,  1984;  Schnyder  and  Nelson,  1987;  Gastal  and 
Nelson, 1994; Fricke, 2002).

The present paper describes a model of whole-plant func-
tioning of grass based on a mechanistic representation of leaf 
growth. The  main  challenge  was  to  identify  a  generic  frame 
based on the existing knowledge of leaf growth integrating the 
effects  of  environmental  conditions. The  model  relies  on  an 
explicit description of plant architecture and two core hypoth-
eses. First, leaf elongation rate and key leaf traits are regulated 
by the concentrations of C and N metabolites in the growth 
zone.  Second,  the  transition  between  successive  phases  of 
elongation is triggered according to coordination within and 
between phytomers. Recently, we have developed CN-Wheat, 
an  FSPM  simulating  C  and  N  metabolism  during  the  post-
flowering  stages  in  wheat,  that  is,  for  a  static  shoot  architec-
ture (Barillot et al., 2016a). For the present work, we focused 
on the implementation of a leaf growth model in CN-Wheat. 
The description of the metabolism was thus extended to the 
growth  zone  of  leaves.  Interactions  of  plants  with  environ-
mental factors were calculated from a dynamic representation 
of leaf geometry. We evaluated the model’s ability to simulate 
leaf growth and key traits at leaf and plant scale. Finally, we ex-
plored the sink–source relations in a growing plant.

Materials and methods

Model description
The present work describes a generic frame to simulate the source–sink 
relations in interaction with the development of plant architecture and 
local environmental factors. The present implementation focuses on the 
early stages of development of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) from the 
exhaustion  of  grain  reserves  to  the  beginning  of  stem  elongation,  that 
is,  when  leaf  and  root  growth  are  the  main  morphogenetic  processes. 
Later  stages  are  not  simulated  because  this  would  require  accounting 
for tiller regression, which was beyond the scope of this work. The fol-
lowing  sections  provide  an  overview  of  the  whole-plant  model  before 
focusing  on  the  main  assumptions  related  to  leaf  growth  and  metab-
olism. Finally, we describe the calibration and evaluation of the model. 
Detailed equations and parameters are available in Supplementary Data 
S1 at JXB online (Protocol S1.1). The terms used in this paper to describe 
the morphology and development of grasses and model components are 
defined in Supplementary Data S3.

A functional structural model of grass development  |  Page 3 of 15

Overview of the model
Botanical structure of the model  The model can simulate an indi-
vidual  plant  or  a  canopy,  described  as  a  collection  of  plants. A  plant 
is composed of one or more tillers. As a provisional choice, all tillers 
share a single root compartment and a single metabolite pool without 
explicit  spatial  representation  (hereafter  called  phloem;  this  does  not 
intend to spatially represent the phloem tube of the living plant but 
instead mimics the functioning of this organ) allowing fluxes of mo-
bile  metabolites  among  organs.  Each  tiller  has  several  growing  and 
mature phytomers, each consisting of a leaf (consisting of a lamina and 
a sheath) and an internode. The number of phytomers increases during 
the simulation as new phytomers are initiated. In a growing phytomer, 
the growth zone, located inside the pseudostem, is represented by one 
single compartment, denoted hz (for hidden growth zone). Each type 
of  mature  tissue  produced  by  the  growth  zones  (lamina,  sheath,  or 
internode) is represented by one or two compartment(s) because we 
distinguish between the enclosed and exposed tissues to account for 
their contrasting light regimes.
Morphogenesis  In our approach, leaf growth is driven by (i) local me-
tabolite concentrations, which depend on the source–sink relations and 
the environmental conditions, and (ii) coordination rules between suc-
cessive leaves: that is, leaf elongation follows a two-phase kinetics and the 
emergence of a leaf outside the pseudostem triggers the phase transition 
for  the  following  leaf. Although  internode  extension  is  limited  for  the 
stages addressed here, their growth has been implemented and partially 
calibrated (Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.1). Briefly, the modelling 
of internode elongation follows the same principles as for leaves, except 
that  for  internodes  the  phase  transition  is  triggered  by  leaf  ligulation. 
Additionally,  an  empirical  sub-model  of  tillering  was  implemented 
(Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.1) to account for self-shading be-
tween tillers and tiller growth costs (Williams, 1964). Tiller emergence is 
coordinated with the emergence of leaves on the main stem (MS), and 
their botanical organization, metabolism, and growth dynamics were ap-
proximated from that of the MS.

Metabolism The model accounts for different groups of state variables 
for  each  organ:  dimensions  (length,  maximum  width),  structural  mass, 
which is the dry mass ‘immobilized’ mainly in the cell wall compounds, 
and concentrations of mobile metabolites [sucrose, nitrates, amino acids 
(AA)] and storage metabolites (starch, fructans, proteins). Metabolite dy-
namics are described by differential equations reflecting the physiological 
activities occurring in the shoot (e.g. photosynthesis, C and N synthesis/
degradation, phloem loading, growth, tissue death) and roots (e.g. N up-
take,  phloem  unloading,  transport  of  nitrates  to  the  shoot,  exudation, 
growth,  tissue  death).  Both  metabolite  concentrations  and  the  physical 
environment  of  each  organ  drive  these  activities.  Compared  with  the 
initial version of CN-Wheat, new metabolic regulations by temperature 
were implemented for phloem conductivity and the rates of synthesis and 
degradation of metabolites (see Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.2).
Implementation  Based on a modular composition described in Barillot 
et al. (2019), the current model is composed of (Fig. 1): (i) sub-models 
of leaf, internode, and root growth; (ii) a dynamic representation of the 
three-dimensional (3D) geometry of plants, which extends the ADEL-
Wheat  model  (Fournier  et  al.,  2003;  Supplementary  Data  S1:  Protocol 
S1.3); (iii) a sub-model of light distribution within 3D canopies (Chelle 
and Andrieu,  1998);  and  (iv)  sub-models  simulating  photosynthesis,  N 
acquisition, synthesis and allocation of C and N metabolites, and senes-
cence at the organ level, which extends the initial version of CN-Wheat 
(Barillot et al., 2016a). Model inputs are hourly climatic conditions (tem-
–,  and  initial  di-
perature,  light,  humidity,  CO2,  wind),  initial  soil  NO3
mensions, mass, and metabolic composition of individual organs at the 
seedling stage. The whole composition is implemented in the OpenAlea 
platform (Pradal et al., 2008, 2015) as a set of modular sub-models com-
municating via a central data structure, the multiscale tree graph (MTG) 
(Fournier et al., 2010; Garin et al., 2014; Albasha et al., 2019; Barillot et al., 
2019; Reyes et al., 2019). The code is open source, available on GitHub 
(https://github.com/openalea-incubator/WheatFspm), 
released 
under a CecILL-C license. The archive of the code used to generate the 
present results is available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759714.

Fig. 1.  Coupling of several sub-models using the multiscale tree graph (MTG) formalism as a central data structure. Boxes 1, 2, and 7 are sub-models 
that already existed (Barillot et al., 2016a), boxes 3 and 5 are newly developed sub-models to integrate plant growth in dimensions and mass, and boxes 
4 and 6 are former sub-models that were adapted to model a growing plant. The numbering refers to the order in which the sub-models are called for 
the simulations. Briefly, the light distribution sub-model calculates the fraction, fPAR, of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by 
each phytoelement of the plant, from the 3D architecture of the plant and the light sources. The absolute absorbed PAR (PARa) is then calculated from 
the incident PAR and fPAR. The photosynthesis and transpiration sub-model calculates C acquisition, transpiration rate, and organ temperature (Temp). 
The coordination sub-model calculates the elongation (increase in length) of the leaves and internodes, as well as other key traits [maximum leaf width, 
specific structural mass (SSM)] based on the current status of the organs in term, of length, metabolite concentrations ([C], [N]), and Temp. The sub-
module ADEL then updates the 3D architecture, which results in an increase in area. The increase in structural mass of the shoot organs is calculated 
from their increase in area and SSM. Based on the above-mentioned calculations, a solver of ordinary differential equations computes N acquisition, 
reactions of synthesis and degradation, and C and N fluxes. Finally, the senescence is calculated from the protein concentration and the age of each 
organ. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)

Detailed assumptions of the leaf growth sub-models
Leaf primordia are initiated according to a constant rate modulated by 
temperature. The plastochron and the final number of leaves are model 
parameters, as are the initial length, structural mass, and composition of 
a primordium.
Structure  of  the  growing  leaf  Before  emergence,  the  leaf  is  repre-
sented only by a hz compartment (Fig. 2). After emergence, the growing 
leaf is represented by a hz, an emerged lamina and, later, by an emerged 
sheath compartment. At the end of leaf elongation, the hz compartment 
is superseded by an enclosed mature sheath compartment, created with 
the same dimensions, structural mass, and metabolites as the former hz.

For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  the  growing  zone  was  identified  as  the 
hidden part of the growing leaf, and thus was represented by the hz com-
partment. This is a simplified representation of the reality, as the hidden 
part of a growing leaf actually encompasses a dividing and an elongating 
zone, plus some mature tissues. Moreover, no distinction was made be-
tween lamina and sheath. We assumed that the hz is supplied with C and 
N by the phloem and by emerged leaf tissues if any are present (Fig. 3). 
The hz is attributed a structural mass variable (including structural N), 
as  well  as  mobile  (sucrose  and AA)  and  storage  (fructans  and  proteins) 
metabolites. The metabolism of the emerged lamina and sheath tissues is 
the same as that of mature photosynthetic organs, except that the former 
export C and N towards their own hz.
Regulation of leaf growth in mass and dimensions by C and N me-
tabolism and coordination rules  Fournier et al. (2005) reported that, 
starting  from  one  phyllochron  before  its  emergence,  the  normalized 
length of wheat leaves increases according to a common pattern for all 
phytomers when expressed in phyllochronic time, that is, thermal time 
normalized by the rate of leaf emergence (Fig. 4). We also observed this 
property on two supplementary datasets (Malvoisin, 1984; Ljutovac, 2002; 
data not shown). Based on these observations, we modelled leaf elong-
ation kinetics as two successive phases, with the transition between the 
phases being coordinated with the emergence of the previous leaf. The 
emergence of leaf n will be denoted En hereafter. The model is briefly 
described below (see Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.1 for details of 
the equations describing leaf growth).

Throughout  the  first  phase  (Fig.  5,  phase  I),  which  mainly  encom-
passes  the  formation  of  the  cell  division  zone,  leaf  length  follows  an 
exponential-like function whose relative elongation rate (RER) is driven 
by (i) the concentrations of sucrose and AA in the hz, (ii) temperature, 
and (iii) leaf rank, which determines the maximum RER. The increase in 
leaf structural mass is estimated from an empirical relationship with leaf 
length, fitted from anatomical observations (Williams and Rijven, 1965). 
As the leaf grows, it will emerge from the pseudostem formed by pre-
vious leaves. This event is central in our approach, since En–1 triggers the 
transition from the first to the second elongation phase of leaf n (Fig. 5).
Throughout  the  second  phase  (Fig.  5,  phases  IIa–IIc),  leaf  elong-
ation follows a sigmoidal function of leaf physiological age modulated 
by air temperature (Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.2). The sig-
moidal function is identical for all leaves and scaled according to leaf 
length at En–1. From En–1 to leaf maturity, the leaf length kinetics are al-
most predefined and only slightly modulated by the concentrations of 

sucrose and AA in the hz. We therefore assumed that the trophic status 
does not impact on the time required to reach the final length but, ra-
ther, the elongation rate has such an effect. The final length of laminae 
and  sheaths  are  calculated  according  to  an  ontogenic  sheath:lamina 
ratio (Dornbusch et al., 2011; Abichou, 2016). Leaf width and SLA are

Fig. 3.  Representation of the growing leaf and its connections with 
other plant compartments. The leaf is described as a set of botanical 
compartments (large rectangles) with structural masses (hexagons) 
and metabolite concentrations (rectangles). Leaf elongation and mass 
growth processes (ovals) take place in the hidden growth zone (hz) and 
are regulated (dotted arrows) by local metabolite concentrations. Only 
exposed tissues are photosynthetic. Fluxes of sucrose and amino acids 
between compartments, and imports of nitrates and amino acids from the 
root compartment, are represented by arrows. (This figure is available in

Fig. 5.  Illustration of the elongation of leaf n (shaded) as represented in the model. See Figs 2 and 3 for identification of the compartments of leaf n. 
The dashed leaf is leaf n–1. Only the mature leaf that defines the pseudostem is represented, which is leaf n–3 in I and En–1, leaf n–2 in IIa, and leaf n in 
IIb, IIc, and III. For simplicity, internodes are not shown. I: From the initiation of leaf n to the emergence of the previous leaf (En–1), leaf n is a primordium 
surrounding the shoot apical meristem. Leaf n is represented as a homogenous hidden growth zone (hz), which imports metabolites from the phloem 
and follows an exponential-like growth. At En–,1 several key variables of leaf n are set and sigmoidal elongation starts. IIa: Leaf n is fully hidden inside the 
pseudostem and elongates according to its predefined sigmoidal function. IIb: The emerged lamina exchanges metabolites exclusively with the hz. IIc: 
The lamina is mature and now connected to the phloem. The sheath is still growing; its emerged part exclusively exchanges metabolites with the hz. III: 
The leaf is fully mature. The former hz is now the mature hidden part of the sheath. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)

important traits that vary with growth conditions, in particular light 
availability  (Friend  et  al.,  1965;  Kemp,  1981;  Schnyder  and  Nelson, 
1989;  Fournier et al., 2001). We hypothesized that the variability re-
ported in response to light conditions originated from a response to 
local  C  availability  (Bertin  and  Gary,  1998). We  also  considered  that 
variations in SLA partly originated from variations in specific struc-
tural masses (SSMs) of laminae (g m–2) and sheaths (g m–1). In order to 
simply account for this plasticity, the maximal leaf width and the SSMs 
of  laminae  and  sheaths  are  calculated  at En  according  to  the  sucrose 
concentration in the hz averaged over the previous two phyllochrons. 
The  structural  masses  of  the  emerged  laminae  and  sheaths  are  then 
dynamically  calculated  from  their  respective  SSMs  and  dimensions. 
Lamina shape and area are calculated according to lamina length, max-
imal width, and rank (Dornbusch and Andrieu, 2010). Once the leaf 
is fully mature (Fig. 5, phase III), the former  hz is considered as the 
mature hidden part of the sheath.
Carbon and nitrogen metabolism of the growing leaf  The model 
of  leaf  elongation  requires  an  explicit  description  of  metabolite  dis-
tribution at organ scale in order to provide the local concentrations 
of sucrose and AA that regulate the elongation rate and the key traits 
described in the previous section. In turn, we assume that the growth 
area and SSMs drive the structural mass synthesis and subsequent con-
sumption of hz metabolites. The cost is calculated by assuming a con-
stant fraction of C and N in the structural mass. Growth respiration 
also  consumes  sucrose  according  to  a  constant  yield  (Thornley  and 
Cannell,  2000).  Fluxes  of  sucrose  and  AA  between  the  phloem  and 
the hz follow diffusion laws, with conductance depending on the hz 
structural mass and temperature. After leaf emergence, we considered 
that  the  emerged  tissues  export  sucrose  and AA  to  their  related  hz. 
At maturity, the sheath and lamina directly load sucrose and AA into 
the phloem according to the transport formalism described in Barillot 
et al. (2016a).

Storage  pools  of  C  (fructans)  and  N  (proteins)  have  also  been  at-
tributed  to  hz  (Schnyder  et  al.,  2000). As  for  photosynthetic  tissues, 
the synthesis and degradation of fructans depend on their local con-
centration and the sucrose concentration (Barillot et al., 2016a). The 
rate of protein synthesis is calculated from a Michaelis–Menten func-
tion of AA concentration. Since Gastal and Nelson (1994) noted that 
protein deposition mainly occurred in the division zone of growing 
tall fescue leaves, we introduced a dependency of the maximal rate of 
protein synthesis to a length ratio representing the size of the division 
zone in the hz.

The mature leaf
Once  growth  is  complete,  the  leaf  consists  of  a  mature  lamina  and 
sheath,  whose  metabolisms  are  described  in  Barillot  et  al.  (2016a). 
The  model  also  accounts  for  tissue  death  (Supplementary  Data  S1: 
Protocol S1.1). At each time step, a constant fraction of green area is 
lost if (i) protein concentration decreases below a fraction of the max-
imum protein concentration reached after leaf ligulation (Barillot et al., 
2016a)  or  (ii)  the  physiological  age  is  higher  than  a  fitted  threshold 
(which applies only to laminae). The structural mass of the remaining 
green tissues is reduced proportionally to the green area, while a frac-
tion of storage metabolites is remobilized towards the green tissue as 
sucrose and AA.

Model evaluation procedure
The  whole-plant  model  was  run  to  simulate  a  wheat  plant  from  the 
emergence of leaf 4 to the beginning of stem elongation (2500 h). The 
model was run with an hourly time step, except for the 3D representation 
of the canopy, which was updated every 4 h. This means that the absorbed 
PAR  was  calculated  from  hourly  values  of  incident  PAR,  applied  to  a

structure updated every 4 h, to limit the computational cost of the calcu-
lation of the distribution of light between phytoelements.

Simulations were compared with three complementary experimental 
datasets (Exp1–Exp3; Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.5) represen-
tative of optimal field conditions in north-western Europe. Detailed ex-
perimental data allowing comparisons with model outputs for identical 
conditions were available only for a few traits; the other traits were evalu-
ated qualitatively, using data collected for various stages of development, 
grass species, or growth conditions. The whole model gathers approxi-
mately  160  parameters,  some  of  which  were  set  in  the  post-flowering 
version of CN-Wheat (Barillot et al., 2016b), while new parameters were 
pragmatically  calibrated  or  taken  from  the  literature  (Supplementary 
Data  S1: Table  S1.2).  Plant  density  was  set  to  250  plants  m–2  and  soil 
–was  initialized  at  6  g  m–2. To  simulate  fertilization  of  Exp1,  soil 
NO3
–was  increased  by  5  g  m–2  at  t=2016  h. We  used  hourly  weather 
NO3
data (temperature, incident PAR, humidity, and wind speed) from Exp1 
(Supplementary Data S2: Fig. S2.1); atmospheric CO2 concentration was 
set at 360 ppm. Initialization of the state variables for each organ was per-
formed from data of Exp1–Exp3. The detailed procedures for parameter 
calibration and model evaluation are presented in Supplementary Data 
S1 (Protocol S1.5).

Results

Fig.  6  and  Supplementary Video  S1  illustrate  the  simulated 
growth of a plant from E4 to ~E9. First, we assessed the ability 
of the model to simulate some major leaf traits and realistic dy-
namics of shoot development. Second, we evaluated whether 
agronomic traits, usually observed at canopy level, emerge from 
the integration of the local processes simulated at organ scale. 
Finally,  we  investigated  the  sink–source  relations  within  the 
plant, with a particular focus on C.

Dynamics of shoot development

The  model  accurately  predicted  the  increase  in  the  final 
length of leaves and sheaths with foliar rank observed in Exp1 
(Fig. 7A). In the model, variations of final leaf length with the 
metabolic  status  and  environmental  conditions  are  generated 
by variations of the duration of the exponential growth prior to 
En–1 (phase I) and of the elongation rate (mainly during phase 
I). Leaf RER observed in Exp1 markedly decreased with leaf 
rank (Fig. 7B), which is in line with studies reporting that mul-
tiple  primordia  of  wheat  leaves  elongate  synchronously  with

panel for identification). (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)

different  RERs  (Williams,  1975;  Malvoisin,  1984;  Ljutovac, 
2002).  Simulated  RERs,  which  depend  on  metabolite  con-
centrations in the hz, temperature, and leaf rank, were aligned 
with these observations, ranging from 1.5 to 2.8×10–6 s–1 (see 
Supplementary  Data  S2:  Protocol  S2.1  for  calculations). The 
model simulates maximal lamina widths from their final length 
and sucrose concentration in the hz (Supplementary Data S1: 
Eqn.  7),  which  predicted  the  increase  in  maximum  lamina 
width with leaf rank, ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 cm (Fig. 7C).

Overall, the simulated SSMs of laminae and sheaths showed a 
positive gradient with leaf rank (Fig. 7D), which arose from the 
dynamics of sucrose concentration in the hz and an ontogenic 
parameter  for  sheaths.  Simulations  of  metabolic  content  and 
structural masses allowed the prediction of specific leaf nitrogen 
(SLN; Fig. 8) and SLA (Supplementary Data S2: Fig. S2.2B) as 
an emerging property of the model. SLN varied between 0.8 
and 1.5 g m–2, showing at any time a vertical gradient from the 
lower to the upper leaves. For leaves that emerged after model 
initiation, the vertical range of SLN increased from ~0.1 g m–2 
at 200 °Cd to ~0.5 g m–2 at 500 °Cd. This is in line with data 
from the literature; for example, for spring wheat with optimal 
N fertilization, Dreccer et al. (2000) reported a vertical range 
of SLN of 0.7 g m–2 before canopy closure. The SLA of indi-
vidual leaves increased from emergence to ligulation and was 
maximal for leaf 4 (~40 m2 kg–1) and then decreased for the 
following leaves (leaf 9, ~27 m2 kg–1).

In our simulations, leaves emerged at relatively stable thermal 
time intervals (Fig. 7E). On average for all leaves, phyllochron 
(see Supplementary Data S2: Protocol S2.1 for calculation) was 
104 °Cd (95% confidence interval 99–109 °Cd), which is rea-
sonably close to the observations (111 °Cd ±0.7). Phyllochron 
stability is a major property of the model emerging from co-
ordination  rules  and  the  modulation  of  elongation  rates  by 
metabolic concentrations.

The  dynamics  of  the  decimal  green  leaf  number  (GLN) 
of the MS (Supplementary Data S2: Eqn. S2.1) were com-
pared  with  four  independent  datasets  representing  three 
winter  wheat  cultivars  (Abichou,  2016).  Experimental  data 
followed  typical  kinetics  (Fig.  9A):  GLN  first  increased  up

to the ligulation of leaf 5, then senescence began and GLN 
declined until the ligulation of the fourth leaf from the top 
(leaf 7 in our simulation). The overall trend of GLN was well 
captured by the model, although the model anticipated the 
senescence of leaf 1, which resulted in a transitory underesti-
mation of GLN by one leaf. The senescence of this leaf was 
triggered by a low N content in the model, meaning that ei-
ther the N dynamics were not well simulated or the rule for 
triggering senescence is not adapted to young leaves, or pos-
sibly both. Since leaf 1 is small, the photosynthetic area was 
underestimated  by  only  12%  at  that  time  (Supplementary 
Data S2: Fig. S2.2A).

The 

index 

simulation  of 

the  green  area 

(GAI) 
(Supplementary  Data  S2:  Eqn.  S2.2)  followed  an  expo-
nential  dynamics  (Fig.  9B)  aligned  with  observations  for 
cv. Soissons and Caphorn. Increases in GAI in the model 
resulted  from  the  development  of  leaves  on  the  MS  and 
the  tillers.  In  the  present  simulation,  four  primary  tillers 
have  emerged  following  the  concept  of  cohorts.  At  the 
end  of  the  simulation,  the  canopy  reached  a  GAI  of  3 
and ground cover, represented by the fraction of incident 
PAR  absorbed  by  the  canopy,  was  above  0.8,  indicating 
canopy  closure  (Fig.  9C). The  close  agreement  between 
observed and simulated GAIs means that the estimates of 
absorbed PAR were calculated from realistic canopies. The 
PAR absorbed per unit surface of green tissues (Fig. 9D) 
showed  large  daily  oscillations  but  no  clear  trend  during 
the simulated period (mean ~3.5 mol m–2 d–1). Altogether, 
these  results  show  that  the  canopy  completely  changed 
from  a  population  of  isolated  plants  to  a  closed  canopy 
with  self-shading  of  the  lower  leaves  (Fig.  9B,  C),  while 
mean light availability per unit surface of green tissue did 
not decrease because of the seasonal increase in light in-
tensity (see Supplementary Data S2: Fig. S2.1B).

Agronomic traits emerged from the integration of local 
processes at plant scale

The  shoot:root  ratio  is  an  important  agronomic  trait  that  is 
strongly  determined  by  gene  ×  environment  interactions. 
Simulated  shoot  and  root  biomasses  increased  exponentially 
over  time  (Fig.  10)  and  the  shoot:root  ratio  increased  from 
~0.8  at  E4  to  ~1.5  at  E9. An  increase  in  the  shoot:root  ratio 
during the tillering period is widely acknowledged but lacks 
accurate quantification. The few studies that have attempted to 
quantify the whole root system during early growth stages in 
field conditions (Siddiqi et al., 1990; Kätterer et al., 1993) re-
ported a shoot:root ratio below 1 at the beginning of tillering 
and  then  an  increase,  which  is  qualitatively  in  line  with  our 
simulations.

Root N fraction decreased from 1.1% at E4 to 0.7% at E9, 
while shoot N fraction was stable at ~4%; these results are rea-
sonably  close  to  the  experimental  data  (Fig.  11),  except  for 
the  latest  date. The  overestimate  of  shoot  N  at  ~550  °Cd  is 
explained by the single N fertilization of 5 g m–2 that was ap-
plied at ~410 °Cd in the model (as in Exp1), whereas the ex-
perimental data shown in the figure are from Exp3, in which 
only 4 g m–2 N were supplied at ~275 °Cd. When expressed 
as a function of the shoot biomass (Fig. 11, inset), the shoot N 
fraction was relatively stable.

applied at 275 °Cd in Exp3 (see Supplementary Data S1: Protocol S1.5) 
whereas the simulation mimicked Exp1, in which 5 g m–2 N was applied at 
~410 °Cd (vertical dotted line). The inset shows the whole shoot N fraction 
together with the critical N dilution curve for winter wheat (dashed line) as 
calculated by Justes et al. (1994). The critical N dilution curve has not been

0.1  and  2.2  g  MJ–1  (Fig.  12B)  and  was  correlated  with  the 
photothermal  quotient  (PTQ)  (see  Supplementary  Data  S2: 
Fig.  S2.4;  R2=0.49,  P=9.10–7). Variations  in  shoot:root  ratio, 
respiration, and exudation played minor roles in the increase in 
RUE simulated from E4. In our simulation, this trend resulted 
from an increase in photosynthesis efficiency originating from 
higher leaf temperature and N content.

Investigating growth costs with respect to plant 
trophic status

Plant trophic status
The concentrations of sucrose and AA in the phloem represent 
the amounts of mobile C and N that can flow between sources 
(mainly  mature  leaves)  and  sinks  (mainly  roots  and  growing 
leaves). Due to low flux resistance, sucrose and AA concentra-
tions in growing leaves (i.e. the hz) were at equilibrium with 
those  in  the  phloem,  ranging  from  ~100  to  550  µmol  g–1  for 
sucrose  and  ~50  to  180  µmol  g–1  for AA  (Fig.  13). The  su-
crose concentration showed large variations over periods of a 
few days, which could be associated with changes in the PTQ 
(Supplementary Data S2: Fig. S2.1C). This reflects that short-
term changes in light and temperature markedly affected the 
source–sink balance and the availability of metabolites in the 
plant. Over the whole simulation period, however, PTQ ex-
plained  46%  of  variations  in  sucrose  concentration  (P=10–7). 
Overall,  phloem  concentrations  did  not  show  a  clear  trend 
during  the  first  80  days,  then  sucrose  presented  an  upward 
trend,  which  coincided  with  the  increase  in  RUE  (Fig.  12). 
AA  showed  a  transient  rise  associated  with  N  fertilization 
(Supplementary Data S2: Fig. S2.1E).

From leaf heterotrophy to leaf autotrophy
The  sink–source  balance  during  leaf  ontogeny  is  illustrated 
(Fig. 14) for leaf 5, which was held on a short internode, and 
leaf 8, which was twice as long and twice as wide and held on 
an  internode  that  will  elongate  later. When  leaves  were  still 
hidden inside the pseudostem, they imported small amounts of 
mobile metabolites from the phloem (<2 µmol day–1 for sucrose; 

Fig. 13.  Phloem and hidden growth zone (hz) concentrations of sucrose 
and amino acids. Phloem concentrations are calculated as the amount 
of metabolites of the phloem divided by the structural mass of the whole 
plant. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)

Over the whole period, the radiation use efficiency (RUE), 
calculated  as  the  ratio  of  shoot  dry  mass  to  the  cumulative 
PAR absorbed by green tissues, was 1.6 g MJ–1. The literature 
lacks accurate estimates of RUE for juvenile stages, and experi-
mental  studies  generally  refer  to  intercepted  global  radiation 
estimated  from  leaf  area  index  using  the  Beer–Lambert  law. 
Using this method, Calderini et al. (1997) reported an average 
RUE of 1.12 g MJ–1 (range 0.98–1.25 g MJ–1) for several cul-
tivars from the double-ridge stage to anthesis. When we pre-
cisely reproduced this method, the RUE calculated from our 
virtual canopy was 1.1 g MJ–1, which is in the middle of the 
reported range. However, simulated plant and shoot dry masses 
did not evolve linearly with the cumulative absorbed radiation 
(Fig.  12A),  and  the  weekly  average  of  RUE  varied  between

Fig. 14.  C metabolism of phytomers 5 and 8 in relation to their growth. For the sake of clarity, daily values are shown from the hourly outputs provided 
by the model. (A, B) Daily fluxes of sucrose from the phloem to the hidden part of the growing phytomers (i.e. the hz) of the main stem. Positive values 
indicate unloading of the phloem into the hz, while negative fluxes represent exports from the hz to the phloem. The curve is shown as long as the impact 
of internode growth on hz fluxes is insignificant. (C, D) Comparison of C assimilation by the leaf and consumption for structural growth. (E, F) Dynamics 
of leaf length (solid line) and exposed green area of the laminae (dashed line). The vertical dashed and dotted lines show the time of leaf emergence and 
previous leaf emergence, respectively. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)

Fig. 14A, B). The daily imports were larger for leaf 8 than leaf 
5, in relation with their respective daily extension (Fig. 14E, 
F). Leaves 5 and 8 switched from heterotrophy to autotrophy 
for C respectively 20 and 10 days after emergence, that is, once 
they had reached ~50% of the final lamina area (Fig. 14E, F). 
These transition times are consistent with estimates for barley 
(Dale,  1985)  and  tall  fescue  (Bregard  and Allard,  1999). The 
cumulative  C  consumption  for  leaf  structural  growth  was 
1.6 mmol for leaf 5 versus 11.9 mmol for leaf 8 (Fig. 14C, D). 
At the end of its life, leaf 5 had produced five times as much C 
as it had consumed for its structural growth (Fig. 14C). Both 
leaves reached the point of return on C investment when they 
were 95% of their final length, which corresponded to the full 
lamina emergence (Fig. 14E, F).

Carbon usage and growth costs
Over the simulated period, 40% of the assimilated C remained 
in the shoot (25% for structural growth and 15% in mobile and 

storage metabolites), 25% was allocated to roots, 27% was lost by 
respiration, and 8% was lost by exudation (Fig. 15A). The frac-
tion of C allocated to shoot structural growth tended to increase 
with time, in accordance with the dynamics of the shoot:root 
ratio (Fig. 10). The simulated trend of C allocation is aligned 
with experiments on wheat based on 14C pulse-labelling, which 
reported  an  increasing  fraction  of  net  assimilated  C  allocated 
to  the  shoot  over  the  growing  season  (reviewed  in  Swinnen 
et al., 1995). During our simulation, 60% of the C allocated to 
the roots remained in the biomass, while 40% was lost through 
respiration  and  exudation.  Experiments  on  wheat  during  til-
lering reported up to 60–75% of losses through these processes 
(Keith et al., 1986; Swinnen et al., 1995), which indicates that 
our model may underestimate root respiration and exudation, 
perhaps  because  it  does  not  consider  root  turnover  for  the 
vegetative  stages.  Daily,  growing  leaves  (MS+tillers)  imported 
on  average  20%  of  the  C  available  in  the  phloem  (Fig.  15B), 
which also represented 20% of daily photosynthesis (Fig. 15C).

account for their flexibility. This has recently motivated a large 
body of literature calling for the building of models closer to 
biological knowledge (Boote et al., 2013; Muller and Martre, 
2019)  while  maintaining  a  sufficient  level  of  parsimony 
(Hammer  et  al.,  2019). With  this  in  mind,  we  developed  an 
individual-based model integrating shoot morphogenesis with 
C and N metabolism at the organ level.

We used metabolite concentrations to drive the behaviour of 
growth zones, which expresses the view that only local variables 
drive the local behaviour. This implied accounting for all activ-
ities affecting the metabolic budget and transfers within the plant. 
This also required a whole-plant model explicitly accounting 
for major metabolic costs including respiration and exudation. 
The expression of growth response to local concentrations, the 
growth-related costs in metabolites, and the response to tem-
perature are novel features compared with the initial version of 
CN-Wheat. The regulation of leaf growth timing by coordin-
ation rules is another essential assumption, which expresses the 
idea that the mechanics of the whole plant body builds, rather 
than  follows,  rhythmic  patterns.  Such  a  view  has  been  previ-
ously  supported  by  both  experimental  and  modelling  papers 
(Casey et al., 1999; Fournier et al., 2005; Andrieu et al., 2006; 
Verdenal et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2014; Vidal and Andrieu, 2019). 
However,  this  is  the  first  time  such  coordinations  have  been 
considered jointly with growth costs and modulations of exten-
sion rates by the plant status. We demonstrated the concept by 
simulating the early stages of wheat growth.

The model simulated as emerging properties plant 
traits that are usually model inputs

Coordination  rules  in  which  the  emergence  of  a  leaf  trig-
gers the rapid extension of the next growing leaf resulted in 
a  regular  rate  of  leaf  appearance  (Fig.  7E). This  mechanism 
played a pivotal role in predicting the increase in size between 
successive leaves (Fig. 7A).

In  our  model,  RUE  is  an  emerging  property  of  C  (and 
N)  budget,  based  on  the  balance  between  the  acquisition  of 
C  by  photosynthesis  and  loss  by  respiration  and  exudation. 
The  average  RUE  calculated  over  the  simulation  period  al-
most exactly matched experimental values reported for similar 
conditions.  RUE  is  known  to  vary  markedly  with  ontogeny, 
temperature, light conditions, and crop nutrition, and is con-
sidered a major target for raising yield potential (Parry et al., 
2011;  Slattery  and  Ort,  2015).  Some  RUE-based  models  in-
clude part of these dependencies (Boote et al., 2013) but ex-
perimental assessment is difficult to achieve because increases 
in biomass can be accurately measured only over long periods 
of time. When considering weekly intervals, simulated RUEs 
varied from 0.10 to 2.2 g MJ–1 (Fig. 12B) and showed large 
short-term changes correlated with photosynthesis efficiency 
(Supplementary  Data  S2:  Fig.  S2.4),  which  was  regulated  by 
leaf temperature and N content. CN-Wheat appears to be a 
tool to disentangle the variability of RUE as a function of plant 
parameters, ontogeny, and growth conditions.

Over  the  simulated  period,  the  simulated  shoot:root  ratio 
increased  from  0.8  to  ~1.5  (Fig.  10),  which  is  in  line  with 

Fig. 15.  C source–sink relations of the whole plant. (A) Cumulative C 
usage as compared with the cumulative C absorbed by photosynthesis. 
(B, C) Daily fluxes of sucrose into the phloem as compared with the 
sucrose phloem content (B) and the C absorbed by photosynthesis daily 
(C). Values are smoothed as the rolling mean of the previous 7 days. The 
curves for the imports of the hidden part of the growing phytomer (hz) 
relate to its heterotrophic stage only. Arrows indicate leaf emergence. (This 
figure is available in colour at JXB online.)

Roots were a major sink, daily importing ~40% of the C from 
the phloem (Fig. 15B). On average, sinks consumed 70% of the 
C from the phloem each day, but photosynthesis maintained a 
high  C  content  in  the  phloem  (Fig.  13),  indicating  a  high  C 
turnover. The source–sink relations were relatively stable over 
the  simulated  period,  despite  marked  changes  in  the  canopy 
structure (Fig. 9) and climatic conditions. The strong daily vari-
ations observed in Fig. 15B and C resulted from variations both 
in fluxes and in phloem sucrose concentrations. Over the simu-
lated period, C influxes became higher than effluxes (Fig. 15C), 
which resulted in an increase in non-structural C in both shoot 
and roots (Fig. 15A).

Discussion

Current models largely integrate predefined behaviours based 
on observations that may not be representative of novel situ-
ations (Poorter et al., 2013). Mechanistic approaches may pre-
dict  these  behaviours  as  emerging  properties  and  therefore

the few data published for comparable situations (Lupton et al., 
1974; Siddiqi et al., 1990). There are large ontogenetic trends 
in  shoot:root  ratio,  together  with  substantial  genotypic  and 
environmental variability (Friedli et al., 2019): this variability 
combined with experimental difficulties makes the shoot:root 
ratio a major unknown in our understanding of C economy in 
plants and the C cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. With a mech-
anistic approach to simulate shoot:root ratio and a conservative 
stoichiometric budget, our approach represents a further step 
forward to address these questions.

The N:C ratio is a key variable in plant models. Most crop 
models  (e.g.  STICS, APSIM,  CERES;  reviewed  in  Zhao  et  al. 
2014)  and  some  FSPMs  (Louarn  and  Faverjon,  2018)  regulate 
morphogenesis  and  N  acquisition  by  comparing  the  current 
value of N:C in the plant shoot to a reference value, the critical N 
concentration. Experimental assessments, however, showed large 
errors (>100%) in N:C estimated with these models (Coucheney 
et  al.,  2015;  Faverjon  et  al.,  2019).  Plant  N  consists  of  diverse 
compounds that have contrasting dynamics and are involved in 
different processes, so limitations should arise from aggregating 
them in a single driving variable. Identifying this complex set of 
processes  in  our  model  resulted  in  plausible  dynamics  of  N:C 
(Fig. 11), which emerged from our model, whereas teleonomic 
approaches use them as a target to drive plant growth.

The model allowed exploration of the functioning of 
growing grass

The 3D modelling of plant architecture has provided novel in-
sights into the environment perceived by plant tissues, allowing 
a better understanding of plant functioning (Chelle, 2005). In 
this  work,  the  simulation  of  metabolite  availability  at  organ 
scale marks a further step by providing highlights on internal 
conditions during the early stages of growth. On the one hand, 
the model showed substantial changes in metabolite availability 
over  short  periods  in  response  to  meteorological  variations 
(Fig. 13). On the other hand, over the whole period, the gen-
eral trend was a moderate increase in sugar availability, despite 
the  increasing  plant–plant  competition,  as  GAI  was  close  to 
3  at  the  end  of  our  simulation  (Fig.  9B). We  could  not  find 
bibliographic data for the changes of metabolites during grass 
development but the trend of increasing C availability is con-
sistent with the fact that the period simulated corresponds to 
active tillering. C availability is expected to decrease drastically 
shortly afterwards because of an increasing C demand for stem 
elongation without an increase in light capture.

The  model  allowed  us  to  explore  the  feedback  loops  be-
tween  sink  and  source  activities  and  metabolite  availability. 
Michaelis–Menten  responses  used  in  the  model  mean  that 
when metabolite concentrations are low, this affects all sinks, 
independently  of  their  size,  but,  depending  on  their  affinity 
for substrate, small sinks are affected even when their growth 
requires  extremely  low  amounts  of  metabolites. When  me-
tabolite  concentrations  are  high,  sink  activity  is  regulated  by 
their maximum rate. This implies that sink hierarchy changes 
depending  on  substrate  availability,  which  showed  consider-
able change over relatively short periods of time in response to 
the photothermal ratio. There was a high turnover of mobile 

metabolites  in  the  plant;  photosynthesis  provided  daily  an 
amount  of  C  representing  ~60%  (range  30–100%)  of  the  C 
available in the phloem (Fig. 15B), while sinks consumed very 
slightly  less,  resulting  in  increasing  C  availability.  Roots  im-
ported daily ~40% of phloem C, while leaf growth zones im-
ported daily only ~10% of phloem C (Fig. 15B). Leaves were 
very  small  sinks  before  their  emergence,  and  after  half  the 
lamina  had  emerged,  their  costs  were  provided  by  their  ex-
posed tissues (Fig. 14).

The model paves the way for improved process 
description and integration over the whole plant cycle

Our approach provides a new frame to combine morphogen-
esis with C and N metabolism, and demonstrates its ability to 
simulate  a  growing  plant.  However,  the  model  requires  fur-
ther validation and several components will likely benefit from 
refinements. The ability of the model to simulate contrasting 
conditions with a unique set of parameters obviously deserves 
further investigation. We used a pragmatic approach for param-
eter fitting; parameters already existing for the post-flowering 
period  were  unchanged,  except  a  few  for  which  we  made 
sure  that  changes  did  not  affect  the  simulations  of  the  post-
flowering  period  (Supplementary  Data  S1:  Protocol  S1.4). 
Given the large difference in growth conditions between the 
early-stage  and  post-flowering  periods,  correctly  simulating 
both  cases  is  the  first  evidence  of  robustness.  Further  devel-
opments  are  needed  to  simulate  the  whole  plant  life  cycle, 
including tiller dynamics and floral transition.

While having a mechanistic structure, the model assembles 
a large number of sub-models (Fig. 1), each being a simplified 
representation  of  the  plant  structure  and  functioning.  The 
present  level  of  detail  is  a  transitory  choice,  to  be  refined 
based  on  further  model  assessment  and  needs.  In  particular, 
the  root  sub-model  could  be  improved  by  a  better  descrip-
tion of the root architecture and the root–soil interactions, as 
well  as  root  growth  and  senescence,  which  were  empirically 
calibrated. Another example is the representation of the hz as 
a single compartment, while it actually includes cell division 
and elongation zones plus some mature tissues. Distinguishing 
these zones may be necessary to more faithfully represent the 
processes leading to the definition of leaf width and SLA, at 
the price of more complexity. In addition, the present imple-
mentation uses a predefined ontogenetic trend to simulate the 
sheath:lamina ratio (Supplementary Data S1: Eqn. 6B), rather 
than incorporating knowledge about ligule formation and ces-
sation of sheath extension (e.g. Vidal and Andrieu, 2019). This 
choice may be revised in future versions. Another example is 
the use of an ontogenetic trend in the maximum RER of leaves 
during their exponential growth (RERmax
leaf , n) (Supplementary 
Data S1: Table S1.2), while it would have been satisfactory to 
define a leaf model whose parameters are all independent of 
leaf rank. Why successive leaves in grasses elongate simultan-
eously  with  different  RERs  has  been  specifically  questioned 
for  a  long  time  (Williams  and Williams,  1968;  Rogan  and 
Smith, 1975). Our simulation showed no trend of a decrease in 
the availability in C or N during the simulated period, which

A functional structural model of grass development  |  Page 13 of 15

excludes the possibility that differences in RER could simply 
originate from competition between an increasing number of 
sinks. The  hierarchy  between  successive  primordia  seems  to 
still lack a clear explanation, and that is what motivated the de-
scription through an ontogenetic trend in our model.

The  present  implementation  is  intended  as  a  frame  to  be 
complemented to simulate the full pre-flowering period. The 
first  step  would  be  implementing  an  explicit  description  of 
tillers, similar to that taken for the MS. The behaviour of grass 
tillers, especially factors controlling their emergence and sen-
escence, is a crucial aspect of crop production, but this is only 
partly  understood.  Our  approach  will  open  opportunities  to 
explore these processes in relation to C and N availability. The 
model  structure  (Fig.  1)  allows  the  implementation  of  new 
modules;  for  example,  a  module  for  apical  meristem  would 
allow simulation of the rate of initiation, the initial properties 
of phytomers, and the change from vegetative to reproductive 
phase. Finally, the focus here on C and N does not mean that 
we assume these variables are sufficient to provide all neces-
sary information in a plant model. However, primary metab-
olites are obviously key variables that were missing in current 
models,  so  we  believe  the  present  work  is  a  significant  step 
towards a mechanistic approach of plant modelling.
