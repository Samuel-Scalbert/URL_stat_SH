ABSTRACT
Information of the geographical and spatial type is found in numer-
ous text documents and constitutes a very challenging target for
extraction. Geoparsing applications have been developed to extract
geographic terms. However, off-the-shelf Named Entity Recogni-
tion (NER) models are mainly designed for Toponym recognition
and are very sensitive to language specificity. In this paper, we
propose a workflow to first extract geographic and spatial entities
based on a BiLSTM-CRF architecture with a concatenation of sev-
eral text representations. We also propose a Relation Extraction
module, particularly aimed at spatial relationships extraction, to
build a structured Geospatial knowledge base. We demonstrate our
pipeline by applying it to the case of French housing advertisements,
which generally provide information about a property‚Äôs location
and neighbourhood. Our results show that the workflow tackles
French language and the variability and irregularity of housing ad-
vertisements, generalizes Geoparsing to all geographic and spatial
terms, and successfully retrieves most of the relationships between
entities from the text.

1 INTRODUCTION
Text-based Geospatial information found in various documents
(e.g social media, newspapers, housing advertisements) plays an
important role in many geographic applications such as Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) enrichment, better understanding and
description of our environments, or the location of events (e.g.,

natural disasters). To capture and extract spatial information from
text, Geoparsing applications have been widely developed and are
mainly focused on Place-name or Toponym extraction. Indeed,
names are often used by people to refer to places and they can be
linked to existing Digital Gazetteers. However, Gazetteers mostly
record official Place names, whereas text documents may contain
non-official, local Place names. Also, spatial descriptions might use
geographic entities (i.e., features like station, beach, city center,
. . . ) to mention places. For example, in housing advertisements,
geographic entities give more information about a neighbourhood
and its facilities.

Another challenge of extracting spatial information is to create
a structured knowledge base. Relationships, and more particularly
spatial relationships, between extracted entities provide a struc-
tured representation of Geospatial information.

Applications and studies from various domains (geography, ur-
ban planning, real estate intelligence, . . . ) could result from the
extracted knowledge. For example, spatial information could help
to locate an entity‚Äîand, in particular, a property‚Äîsince real estate
advertisers do not always provide the exact location. Spatial and
urban analyses may also be carried out about perception of resi-
dential spaces, valuable neighborhood factors or influential zone of
a toponym.

In this work, we propose an automatic workflow for extracting
Geospatial knowledge from text written in French. The workflow is
divided in two main stages. First, we extend Named Entity Recogni-
tion to Spatial entities designed for French housing advertisements.
Then, we develop a Relationship Extraction model to locate Spatial
entities. The contributions of this paper may be summarized as
follows:

‚Ä¢ We define new Spatial entity categories to describe locations.
‚Ä¢ We propose a Named Entity Recognition model to extract
Toponyms and our new Spatial entities from French housing
advertisements.

‚Ä¢ We develop a Relationship Extraction model to create a struc-

tured Geospatial knowledge base.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews
related work on Geographic Named Entity Recognition and Rela-
tionship Extraction; Section 3 presents the methodological details
of our automatic workflow for extracting Geospatial Knowledge;
Section 4 presents and discusses the results of experiments based
on French housing advertisements dataset; Finally, Section 5 draws
some conclusions and outlines directions for further research.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Geographic Named Entity Recognition
Geoparsing is the task to detect geographic terms from text and has
been widely used in various types of texts such as travel blogs [1],
social media in emergencies [7, 11], housing advertisements [9],
or fictional novels [21]. This method is often a subtask of Named
Entity Recognition (NER) applied to geographic entities. In [15]
and [30], the authors reviewed traditional to state-of-the-art NER
approaches. The traditional approach is based on linguistic rules
and Knowledge systems and often uses Gazetteers. This approach
is frequently used for Geoparsing [16, 21] but gives limited results
and depends on the completeness of the rules and Gazetteers. In
recent years, deep neural network models have been developed
and achieved very good results on NER taks and particularly for
Toponym Recognition [28, 29].

Most of the above-mentioned works only detect Toponyms in
the English language. However, our research focused on all ge-
ographical and spatial terms in the French language, for which
limited linguistic resources are available. In [19], the authors have
defined and extracted French Spatial Nominal Entities that refer
to physical objects in a spatial context (i.e., a geographic term that
is not linked to a Toponym), which is similar to our proposal. Re-
garding the French language, [4] compared different deep neural
network models to retrieve Named Entities applied to French Legal
texts. They demonstrated that BiLSTM-CRF combined with text
representations gives the best results for this task.

2.2 Relationship Extraction
Relationship extraction (RE) aims at extracting semantic relation-
ships from a text, usually between two or more entities of a certain
type. A large number of works use features of dependency-parsed
sentences as extraction patterns or Machine Learning input [3, 6, 26].
Several methods have been developed from Dependency Graph
such as shortest path dependency or frequent sub-graph. In [5], the
authors have proven that the shortest path dependency kernel is
very efficient in extracting binary relationships. [12] has extended
this method to ùëõ-ary relationships. Another approach [8] is to find
frequent sub-graph from the Dependency Graph to discover pat-
terns. In a recent work [10], a Dependency Graph has also been
used in a neural network. The idea is to embed several adjacency
matrices to get a better dependency representation. Thus, a Graph
Convolutional Network is applied to the Dependency Graph and
then the new embedding feeds a classification model. The use of
deep Learning methods is more and more frequent in the field of
RE, as summarized in [22], and achieves state-of-the-art results.
Nevertheless, neural networks need huge annotated corpora for
training, and might not be effective for relationships occurring in
just a few examples.

3 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Overview
In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to automatically
retrieve spatial information in housing advertisements, mostly lo-
cated in the French Riviera, and extract relationships to create a
structured knowledge base.

The two main stages of the proposed method are:
‚Ä¢ Perform Spatial Named Entity Recognition;
‚Ä¢ Retrieve relationships between Spatial entities.

3.2 Spatial Information in Housing

Advertisements

Housing advertisements have several advantages to extract spatial
information as they generally provide information about a prop-
erty‚Äôs environment and location. Indeed, location is one of the most
important factors in purchasing decisions. Thus, advertisers give a
description of the neighbourhood and its facilities to promote the
location to a future resident. Also, housing advertisements are a
fairly exhaustive and updated source of data since many geographic
areas are found and they are posted recurrently. Finally, advertisers
often provide an online version that facilitates data collection (e.g.,
by crawling housing websites).

Thus, before retrieving information, we identified 4 spatial entity
categories in housing advertisements that describe the neighbour-
hood of a property and spatial relationships:

‚Ä¢ Geographic entity: entity representing natural features,
constructions and subdivisions of land which is located on
or near the surface of the earth.

‚Ä¢ Toponym: entity referring to proper names of places (also

known as place name or geographic name)

‚Ä¢ Spatio-Temporal entity: entity localizing geographic en-

tity or Toponym

‚Ä¢ Mode of transportation: entity describing the travel mode

between two places

The first two categories, Toponym and geographic entity, explic-
itly define the environment at different levels. Entity can refer to
places in the residential area of a property, its neighbourhood or
even the city. Toponym, or place name, is the most classic way to
characterize a place and is found in many Named Entity Recog-
nition frameworks. Also, Gazetteers, such as GeoNames, already
record millions of place names around the world. On the other
hand, a geographic entity also describes a place but is frequently
associated with a Toponym (e.g., University of Nice, Nice-Riquier
station, Mass√©na square, etc.). Thus, even if geographic entities
are often mentioned in the literature, this category is never ex-
tracted. However, a geographic entity itself still gives information
about a neighbourhood and its facilities. For example, we can ex-
tract the number of schools in an area or the proximity with public
transport. Also, we can infer the exact place by cross-analysis with
other databases and the spatial context.

After referencing places with Toponyms and geographic entities,
we want to locate them to better understand their spatial context.
Spatial relationships play a key role to link all those entities and
a property in the space. However, a spatial relationship might be
expressed in different ways (e.g., temporal or kilometer distance).
Thus, we propose to create a Spatio-Temporal entity, which de-
scribes the spatial relationship between two places or a place and
a property. It can be an exact or vague distance (e.g., near, 10 kilo-
meters away, 5 minutes, etc.). Lastly, the Mode of transportation
entity specifies the Spatio-Temporal entity (e.g., 5 minutes walking
is different from 5 minutes driving) and can reduce its vagueness.
Table 1 shows several examples of those 4 types of entities.

3.3 Named Entity Recognition
The first stage of our pipeline is the Named Entity Recognition
module, which extracts all the entities mentioned above. The pro-
posed model is based on a BiLSTM+CRF architecture [13], which
has achieved very good results on NER tasks. We also added an em-
bedding to the BiLSTM+CRF, which is a global vector composed of
the concatenation of three different text representations, to capture
features at different levels (see Figure 1).

The first text representation is a basic Word Embedding archi-
tecture [20] that we trained on our corpus of French housing ad-
vertisements. Secondly, we fine-tuned the two pre-trained French
Flair Language Models [2] with our corpus, which corresponds to
a BiLSTM Language Model. This Language Model has a context-
based and character-level representation that is well-suited for
complex tasks. Also, the specificity of only keeping the first and
last state helps handle out-of-vocabulary words and small dictio-
naries. Finally, its French pre-trained model is a good advantage
for our task since few models are available for French. Finally, we
applied CamemBERT [17], a French Transformer Language Model.
Transformers are faster and more efficient than BiLSTM or CNN ar-
chitectures, since they use parallel attention layers [27]. Moreover,
Transformer Language Models are trained on huge corpora with
two specific tasks: masked language model (MLM) and next sen-
tence prediction (NSP). For MLM, some tokens are masked and the
model has to predict them in a sentence. The other task (NSP) aims
at predicting, of two sentences, which one follows the other. While
those models reach high performance, some limitations have arisen:
the need of a huge training set on the one hand and limitation of
their application to specific domains or tasks due to pre-trained
models on general domain on the other hand. Nevertheless, we de-
cided not to fine-tune the French pre-trained model, CamemBERT,
due to a lack of a huge training corpus.

Housing advertisements have language and stylistic specificity
and variability, and an informal format that are captured with the
above three text representations.

3.4 Relationship Extraction
The previous stage identifies spatial entities thanks to a NER model.
However, information is totally unstructured, whereas there ex-
ist relationships between entities in the text. The last part of our
method tries to reconstruct relationships between spatial entities
and provide a structured representation of extracted information.

We determined four types of relationships to get a structured knowl-
edge base:

‚Ä¢ Attributes: attributes of spatial entities such as adjectives,
numerical, noun object (e.g., 5 minutes, residential neigh-
bourhood, etc.);

‚Ä¢ Geographic Composition: affiliation link between geo-
graphic entity and/or Toponym (e.g., Nice City Center, City
of Cannes, Audiberti High School, etc.);

‚Ä¢ Spatial: relationship between Spatio-Temporal entity and

geographic entity, Toponym or the property itself;

‚Ä¢ Mode of transportation: relationship between Spatio-Temporal

entity and Mode of transportation.

We made several assumptions to perform the relation extraction.
The first is that a relationship occurs only between two entities
of the same sentence. Then, we assumed that a direct or indirect
connection between the two entities always exists in the sentence,
which can be captured by a dependency graph. Our last assumption
is that words between the two entities also play an important role.
Thus, we highlighted two types of features to recognize the

relationships:

‚Ä¢ Shortest path dependency between entities;
‚Ä¢ Sub-phrase between entities.

Shortest-Path Dependency. In a sentence, the syntactical
3.4.1
structure based on grammar gives relationships between words
as a tree. Two methods are frequently used: Constituency and De-
pendency parsing. On the one hand, Constituency parsing uses the
formalism of context-free grammars and the sentence is divided
in sub-phrases that belong to the same grammatical category. On
the other hand, Dependency parsing directly assigns grammatical
connections between words. A relation is binary and consists of a
head word, a dependent word and a grammatical function. This ap-
proach is more suitable for analysing housing advertisements, since
the order of words does not always follow classical grammar (e.g.,
housing advertisements do not always contain a verb or a subject).
Also, the head-dependent relation offers a good approximation of
predicate-argument relation for Information Extraction. Finally,
the Universal Dependencies taxonomy [24] is general enough to
easily capture dependencies in housing advertisements and can be
adapted to another language. As we did not have a labeled corpus
available, we performed dependency parsing using Stanza [25] for
French, which is based on the Universal Dependencies taxonomy
and is already trained on a large corpus.

Table 2: Features of candidate relationships

However, this model was not very accurate, especially with the
Part-of-Speech tagging module. Thus, we trained a Part-of-Speech
tagger by first predicting labels with an existing tagger and then
correcting predictions to get a labeled data set.

After carrying out dependency parsing, we got a dependency
graph of each sentence and extracted the shortest directed path for
each candidate relationship. The path is composed of nodes that
represent entities or Part-of-Speech tags and edges corresponding
to grammatical relations.

Figure 2 shows Spatial Named entities, Part-of-Speech tags and
Dependency parsing in a sentence. Two type of relationships oc-
cur in this example: spatial and geographic composition. To find
a spatial relationship, the shortest-path dependency is extracted
between a Toponym or Geographic entity and a Spatio-Temporal
entity. For geographic composition relationship, the aim is to find
a path between two Geographic entities, two Toponyms or a Geo-
graphic entity and a Toponym. All the candidate relationships and
their shortest-path dependencies are summarized in Table 2.

3.4.2 Classification. After extracting all the candidate relation-
ships thanks to the shortest path, we built four classification models,
one for each type of relation. Those models take as input the sub-
phrase between two entities and their shortest-path dependency.
We transformed both inputs into vectors with an embedding model.
For the sub-phrase, we used the same embedding as for the Named
Entity Recognition task.

Regarding the shortest-path dependency, we chose to model the
path as a sequence of entities (Named Entities or Part-of-Speech
tags) and grammatical relations. Thus, we embedded each sequence
based on the Sqn2Vec method [23]. This method is unsupervised
and designed for small-vocabulary sequential datasets. It combines
two techniques: Sequential Pattern Mining and Neural Embedding
Learning. The idea is to first extract all the Sequential Patterns
from the dataset and then to learn an embedding for each sequence.
The embedding is a concatenation of two representations. The
former is only based on predicting which single symbols are in the
sequence while the latter predicts to which Sequential Pattern the
sequence belongs to. Both predictions are based on a Paragraph
Vector-Distributed Bag-of-Words [14].

We could have used a graph embedding model [10], since depen-
dency relationships are represented as a graph. Graph embedding
is often based on the adjacency matrix, which embeds either nodes
or edges. However, we noticed that the entities (i.e., nodes) and
the grammatical relations (i.e., edges) are both important in the
shortest-path dependency. Thus, we needed an embedding that
takes both into account.

3.4.3 Output. The final step is focused on the representation of
the extracted relationships in a structured knowledge base. Fig-
ure 3 shows a graph representation of the previous example. Nodes
represent Spatial entities and edges the type of relationship. Re-
garding spatial relationships, Spatio-Temporal entities (at the heart
and close to) should describe the relationship between two places or
a place and a property. Thus, spatial relationship can be viewed as
a ternary relationship with a place or a property as subject and/or
object, and a Spatio-Temporal entity as attribute of the predicate.
In this example, the subject is missing, as we have only detected a
link between a Spatio-Temporal entity and one geographic entity.

If (and only if) the subject is missing, we always assume that the
property being advertised is the subject.

Finally, a post-processing step should be applied to get ternary
and binary relationships in order to create a Geospatial Knowledge
Graph, whose description is out of the scope of this work.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we apply the proposed two-stage workflow to a
dataset of French housing advertisements in the French Riviera.
We first describe the dataset and then present the results and the
performance of the workflow.

4.1 Dataset
As a standard French dataset is not available to train and evalu-
ate our method, we collected about 1,200 housing advertisements1
written in French gathered from various online advertisers on the
French Riviera. The average length of the ads is about 650 words
after a preprocessing stage. Cleaning the text was necessary since
the French house ads were full of noisy, repetitive words and ab-
breviations. We also removed new lines, URLs, special symbols and
characters (e.g., &, #, *) using regular expressions. Then, we man-
ually annotated the dataset following the BIESO tagging scheme.
Finally, we split the dataset into 10 folds and evaluated our pipeline
through cross-validation.

4.2 Performance Evaluation
In this subsection, we evaluate the performance of the two stages
of our workflow. We start by comparing several architectures for
Named Entity Recognition, trained on our annotated spatial enti-
ties. We chose the Spacy and Bi-LSTM-CRF architectures as they
do not use the same type of neural networks (CNN and RNN re-
spectively). We could not compare them with off-the-shelf models,
as they do not extract the same Named Entities. Regarding Spacy,
we fine-tuned a pre-trained model for French with our entities and
trained another from scratch. For the second architecture, we tried
different embeddings and combinations to handle French and the
language specificity of housing advertisements. We fine-tuned the
Flair embedding and trained a Word2Vec model.

where ùëãùëñ and ùë†ùëã ùëñ are, respectively, the ùëñùë°‚Ñé sample mean and its
standard error, to measure statistical significance of the difference
between F1-Scores at a 1% significance level.

In Table 3, we present average Precision, Recall, F1-Score and
their standard deviation, based on the 10-fold cross-validation. Table
4 shows the models that have weak or no evidence of a significantly
different F1-Score.

First, we notice that BiLSTM+CRF architecture mostly outper-
forms Spacy architectures except with Word2Vec embedding at
a 1% significance level. Spacy architecture gets slightly better re-
sults with a model trained from scratch. Regarding BiLSTM+CRF
models with a single embedding, CamemBERT achieves very good
performance. Flair gets a similar Recall to CamemBERT but the
Precision is lower. We can underline that the combination of Flair
and CamemBERT increases the performance of the 3 metrics. The
combination of Flair and Word2Vec or CamemBERT and Word2Vec
increases the Precision but decreases the Recall. Moreover, there is
no evidence of statistically significant differences between those
models. Finally, the combination of the three representation (Flair
+ CamemBERT + Word2Vec) achieves the best results while the
Welch‚Äôs t-test does not show difference with Flair + CamemBERT.
Nevertheless, we chose to keep this model for our application.

The second evaluation consists of estimating the performance
of each relationship classification. We created four datasets with
candidates for each type of relationships and tagged them with a
binary label. We tried different classification models such as Naive
Bayes, Support Vector Machine or XGBoost, and quantified their
performance with Accuracy defined as

Accuracy =

In Table 5, we present the best performance of each classification
using an XGBoost model. All classifications get an accuracy above
95% and even 97% for three of them. However, those results might
be biased because of the small dataset for some relationships and
imbalanced classes. Especially, Mode of Transportation relationship
has been evaluated on a very small dataset (216 rows) and totally
imbalanced classes (209 label 1 and 7 label 0). The other three
relationships are more accurate since their dataset contains more
than 3,000 examples for Geographic Composition and Spatial and
6,000 examples for Attributes.

Table 5: Performance of Relationship Extraction models

All in all, our proposed workflow performs well to retrieve Spatial
entities and relationships. Nevertheless, we separately evaluated

each model which does not represent the global performance of the
pipeline. Indeed, the Relationship Extraction stage depends on the
good results of Named Entity Recognition model. Thus, the error is
propagated across the model and should be quantified with a fully
annotated dataset with both Spatial entities and relationships.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed a two-stage method to automati-
cally retrieve Geospatial information from housing advertisements.
A major contribution is the recognition of Geographic and Spatio-
Temporal entity to better understand the spatial context. Also, the
Named Entity Recognition model is fine-grained to discover new
Toponyms that would have not been found with off-the-shelf NER
models. Another contribution is the Relationship Extraction tool
and in particular the Spatial relationship. We have proposed to
build binary relationship between Spatio-Temporal entities and
Toponyms, Geographic entities or the property to easily capture a
ternary Spatial relationship in a post-processing part. Finally, our
method is designed for French language and housing advertise-
ments but can be adapted to other languages and types of text by
annotating a corpus, changing the embedding and retraining the
model. In addition, some domain- and task-specific heuristics, such
as assuming that an implicit subject is the property being adver-
tised, would have to be dispensed with or replaced when adapting
our method to other tasks or domains.

Several directions could be considered to expand this work. First,
Entity Recognition is only the first step of Information Extraction,
and adding Entity Resolution would help to reduce ambiguity of
Toponym and Geographic entity. A number of Toponym Resolution
models already exist but may not be efficient for Geographic en-
tity. Also, it would be interesting to link Toponym and Geographic
entities to existing Knowledge bases (e.g GeoNames, DBpedia, Wiki-
data). Second, we have extracted Spatio-Temporal entities in order
to build Spatial relationships; however the Real Estate market often
exaggerates proximity-related terms and introduces uncertainty
and vagueness in their advertisements [18]. A promising work
would be to qualify and quantify the uncertainty and vagueness of
those terms to improve the reliability of the location of the men-
tioned places. Third, the extracted information combined with their
socio-spatial context may be analysed and studied within urban
space researches (e.g., perception of residential spaces, elements of
a neighbourhood, valuable neighborhood factor).
