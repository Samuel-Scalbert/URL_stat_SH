Abstract.  We  collected  user  needs  to  define  a  process  for  setting  up  Federated 
Learning  in  a  network  of  hospitals.  We  identified  seven  steps:  consortium 
definition,  architecture  implementation,  clinical  study  definition,  data  collection, 
initialization, model training and results sharing. This process adapts certain steps 
from the classical centralized multicenter framework and brings new opportunities 
for interaction thanks to the architecture of the Federated Learning algorithms. It is 
open for completion to cover a variety of scenarios.

1. Introduction 

In the usual analytical process involving multiple centers, patient data are shared to a 
centralized  location  to  perform  analyses,  which  raises  privacy,  technical,  and  data 
ownership  concerns.  As  an  alternative  approach,  Federated  Learning  (FL)  consists  in 
training statistical models in a decentralized way, leaving the data on each site, running 
computations  locally  and  communicating  aggregated  information  between  centers 
during the training phase [1]. The two main topologies of networks for FL deployment 
come out of either an aggregation server (centralized) or a peer-to-peer (decentralized) 
workflow  [2].  FL  allows  to  use  data  from  multiple  centers,  which  often  improves 
studies'  robustness,  while  addressing  the  problem  of  data  governance  and  improving 
data privacy. 

In a previous study, we demonstrated that odd-ratios and their confidence intervals 
resulting  from  a  decentralized  logistic  regression  were  consistent  with  the  ones 
obtained with the traditional centralized model [3]. Other studies implemented Support-
Vector  Machine,  Principal  Components  Analysis  or  Neural  Networks  using  FL  [4]. 
More  recently,  FL  has  been  beneficial  for  predicting  seven-days  mortality  in 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients from five local hospitals [5]. It may also be applied to 
patient  similarity  detection  or  adverse  drug  events  detection  [6].  Privacy-preserving

mechanisms,  such  as  secure  aggregation  and  differential  privacy,  can  also  be  used  to 
enhance FL so as to further address legal, ethical and security concerns related to data 
sharing [7]. 
Despite 

the  healthcare  community, 
recommendations  on  how  to  deploy  it  in  a  routine  use  remain,  to  the  best  of  our 
knowledge,  scarce.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  an  analysis  of  the  existing  situation  to 
submit  specifications  to  efficiently  design  and  implement  a  federated  learning 
framework across a network of hospital partners, based on the needs of hospital actors 
themselves.

2. Methods 

After identifying all the actors involved in multicenter clinical studies, semi-structured 
interviews  were  performed  by  phone  call  in  7  French  university  hospitals  (Amiens, 
Caen,  Dijon,  Lille,  Marseille,  Rouen,  Toulouse).  Interviewees  were  researchers, 
physicians,  IT  engineers,  data  scientists  and  data  managers.  The  interviews  aimed  to 
understand  how  to  implement  FL  in  routine,  to  identify  which  actors  are  involved  at 
each stage, their function and points of concern, along with their ideas and proposals to 
improve  this  process  practice.  Specific  questions  were  then  asked  according  to  the 
profiles of the interviewees (Table 1).

architecture  implementation,  clinical  study  definition,  data  collection,  initialization, 
model  training  and  results  sharing.  Figure  1  describes  this  sequence  along  with  the 
actors  involved  at  each  stage.  Thereafter,  it  will  be  admitted  that  the  initiative  for 
multicenter studies using FL is carried out by the "investigating center". By definition, 
this requires the investigators to have experience related to FL techniques. 

3.1 Setting up the consortium 

The following two steps need to be performed only once: 

Consortium  definition (decision-makers,  researchers): search for collaborators 
(e.g. some research teams in public hospitals working on similar fields, or members of 
any biostatistical department) that might be part of the consortium. A short introduction 
with  the  basics  of  federated  learning,  current  applications  and  added-value  should  be 
given  to  centers  with  no  prior  knowledge  on  FL.  In  particular,  one  should  give 
incentives to centers that might be reluctant to go into decentralized multicenter studies 
using  FL.  As  part  of  prospecting  for  collaborators,  one  should  identify  the  different 
actors that might be involved in each center (e.g. IT engineers, researchers, physicians, 
legal  experts,  data  protection  officers),  with  a  point  of  vigilance  for  the  IT  engineer 
who  is  the  key  person  in  the  process.  Once  centers  (and  corresponding  actors)  have 
been  identified,  they  should  agree  on  a  collaboration  policy  and  address  all  legal 
questions. 

Architecture implementation (IT engineers, data scientists): deployment of the 
logistic framework that will allow the different centers to communicate and the future 
studies  to  be  launched  easily  without  resorting  to  the  IT  engineers  (a  data  scientist 
could possibly deal with IT issues instead). This step notably implies setting up virtual 
machines with secured communication ports and running tests to ensure the readiness 
of the FL workflow. 

3.2 Performing the study 

The following five steps are to be run for each study: 

Clinical study definition (researchers, physicians, data scientists): 
(a) Proposition of a study by some center(s) to the consortium with a principal and 
potentially secondary objectives. According to the pursued objectives, an overview of 
the data  needed should be provided as a first simple eligibility criterion : in center  c, 
does any research team, hospital department, individual researchers or doctors have the 
desired  data  and  would  be  interested  by  the  aforementioned  objectives?  does  the 
center's  data  warehouse  hold  the  targeted  data?  This  way,  collaborators  can  be 
identified in each center. 

(b) Establishment of a detailed research protocol (collectively or by some centers). 
As in multicenter studies, objectives, data, methods and results dissemination are to be 
agreed  upon  beforehand.  However,  in  federated  computations,  methodological  details 
such  as  statistical  model,  learning  algorithms  and  data  integrity  tests  must  be 
anticipated. Technical and practical organization points should also be discussed: how 
to  guarantee  privacy?  when  to  execute  the  computations?  how  to  handle  unstable 
networks? can new partners be added during computations? 

Data  Collection  (data  scientists,  researchers,  physicians):  prospective  or 
retrospective center-wise data collection. An interoperable data set is made accessible 
to the FL algorithms, provided it can lawfully be used for research purposes. 

A. Lamer et al. / Speciﬁcations for the Routine Implementation of Federated Learning

Initialization  (IT  engineers,  data  scientists):  data  integrity  and  secure  network 
connections  verification.  To  check  for  outliers,  verify  model  assumptions  and/or  to 
normalize data sets, a few statistical estimators may be exchanged across centers. 

Model  training  (IT  engineers,  data  scientists):  when all participants are ready, 
the  model  training  is  launched  by  the  investigator.  Local  gradients  are  computed  on 
each center's data, and then exchanged across the network in order to update the shared 
models; this is repeated until model convergence, according to the criteria agreed upon 
in the protocol. At the end of this step, a validation check should be run to assert that 
all centers share the same results. 

Results  sharing  (researchers,  physicians):  each  participant  retrieves  the  results 
of the study. Those can be measurements (odd-ratios, confidence intervals, F1 score, p-
values,  ...),  models’  parameters  or  models’  predictions.  Models’  losses  as  well  as 
system logs collected during the previous step should be analyzed by data scientists and 
IT  engineers  respectively.  Any  system  dysfunction  that  could  compromise  the  results 
should be reported to the investigator. Optionally, participants may be asked to validate 
results to allow moving on to further analyses and dissemination.

4. Discussion 

In  this  paper,  we  interviewed  public  hospitals'  actors  from  7  French  centers.  The 
objective  was  to  analyse  user  needs  for  the  design  and  the  effective  deployment  of 
federated  multicenter  clinical  studies.  As  part  of  a  generic  roadmap,  we  identified 
seven  key  steps  designed  for  any  member  of  the  healthcare  community  willing  to  go 
into FL. One advantage of the proposed process is to keep close to the well-established 
process  of  centralized  multicenter  studies.  Indeed,  the  FL  process  shares  most  of  the 
classical  steps  in  place  in  clinical  research  centers:  consortium  setup,  study  proposal 
and acceptance, results dissemination. 

We  remark  that  in  contrast  with  classical  multicenter  studies,  which  only  require 
partners  to  collect  data  and  may  fully  delegate  their  processing  to  the  investigator  in 
charge of their statistical exploitation, FL relies on centers' ability to handle some data

preparation locally, and to allocate computational resources for model training, which 
can  engage  supplementary  costs.  In  FL,  centers  also  need 
to  be  available 
simultaneously at both computation and evaluation times, with reliable communication 
channels.  However,  distributing  the  study  definition,  modeling  and  evaluation  steps 
yields increased and more diverse opportunities for data-owners to review and validate 
the  methodology  and  results.  This  empowers  non-investigating  centers  and  can 
potentially result in better-controlled study quality. 

Our  framework  remains  general,  leaving  several  points  (e.g.  network  topologies, 
types  of  study,  classes  of  statistical  models...)  open  for  refinement  into  a  variety  of 
scenarios. This work is therefore a first step towards a full specification of a federated 
learning  protocol  and  its  implementation  in  different  settings.  In  our  opinion  and 
personal experience, those guidelines may be useful to anyone interested in FL from a 
statistical and/or clinical point of view, and willing to design new decentralized studies 
from  scratch.  We  did  not  address  the  choice  of  a  specific  tool  or  library  to  perform 
federated  computations.  We  note  that  existing  tools  [3,8]  could  fit  within  our 
framework,  but  usually  only  tackle  the  model training  step,  and  are  for  the  most  still 
limited to simulated network environments. 

5. Conclusions 

In this study, we propose specifications for setting up and routinely running FL in 
a network of hospitals. It adapts certain steps of the multicenter centralized process and 
brings new opportunities for interaction, data ownership and flexibility thanks to the FL 
architecture.  This  general  process  is  open  to  completion,  so  as  to  cover  with  greater 
precision the plurality of scenarios it can be applied to.
