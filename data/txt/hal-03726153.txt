ABSTRACT 
We  propose  to  present  a  set  of  web  audio  plugins  specialized  in 
three kinds of sounds…. The first one targets blues / classic rock 
sounds and proposes a drop down menu with presets that go from 
clean warm blues like the tones used by BB King, to more classic 
rock/blues distorted sounds used by Jimmy Hendrix or AC/DC. The 
second one is aimed to Hi Gain/Metal sounds similar Mesa Boogie 
type sounds, and the third one is an acoustic guitar simulator (use 
an  electric  guitar  and  get  an  acoustic  folk  guitar  sound).  These 
plugins are partially available in open source, but the versions we 
propose  to  demo  are  commercialized  by  our  laboratory  (French 
CNRS/SATT Sud-Est) and included in some commercial DAWs. 

nonlinear differential algebraic equations and may be solved using 
integration  methods,  roots  solver  algorithms,  and  sparse  matrix 
techniques.  SPICE  can  even  produce  C++  code  ready  to  be 
executed.  However, 
to  make  huge 
simplifications and optimizations to achieve real-time processing. 
This is particularly the case with the modeling of the vacuum tubes 
used in guitar amplifiers and their interactions with other parts of 
the circuitry (see [2] and [8] for a review of common techniques, 
and [9] for the method used by authors of the Guitarix.org project). 

is  often  necessary 

it 

Another  technique  consists  in  a  higher-level  emulation,  in  which 
“logical”  parts  are  identified  (filters,  tubes,  etc.)  and  may  be 
emulated  manually  or  by  machine  learning  [10-14]  (as  with  the 
Kemper profiler/Guitar Rig 6 from Native Instruments, with Neural 
DSP’s  gears  or  Deepmind’s  WaveNet  music  generators)  using

input gain and merging/muting left and right channels. It 
also includes a multi-channel noise gate.

Introduction and related works 
In 2012, Google Chrome proposed for the first time a low-latency 
opportunity  to  get  live  audio  from  a  microphone  or  other  audio 
inputs. Soon, Opera, Firefox and Microsoft Edge also implemented 
this. Chris Wilson’s “Input Effects” demo was one of the first to 
show real-time sound processing effects written with Web Audio, 
and  proposed  implementations  of  famous  effects  such  as  delay, 
distortion, wah, etc. This impressive demo proved that low latency 
processing  was  achievable.  Getting  close  to  the  real  sound  of  an 
analog guitar amplifier remained nevertheless quite a challenge that 
Chris Wilson’s examples did not fully address. 

Many  papers  have  been  written  about  vacuum-tube  guitar 
amplifiers modeling and about the characteristics of linear and non-
linear  distortion  effects  suited  for  guitars  [4-7].  Two  main 
approaches  are  usually  considered  for  the  simulation  of  the 
different parts of a guitar amplifier: one is called the technique of 
virtual analog aka physical modeling. It consists in processing the 
electronic schematics using tools like the industry standard SPICE 
analog circuit simulator to translate the circuit into equations to be 
solved hopefully in real-time. These general equations are typically

separate or global, explicit or hidden models to achieve perceptual 
equivalence.  

When  we  started  to  tackle  this  problem  five  years  ago  [16],  the 
separate,  explicit  approach  was  clearly  the  simpler  and  more 
adapted one to the Web Audio ecosystem esp. its limitations at the 
time  (e.g.  custom  processing  on  audio  samples  was  not  usable 
without  introducing  latency  or  glitches,  AudioWorklet  node  was 
not  available).  Furthermore,  the  Web  Audio  API  provides  high-
level  nodes  (such  as  the  WaveShaper  node  and  the  biquad  filter 
node) that can be used for an easy, quite accurate modelisation of 
tubes  and  filters.  Namely,  when  properly  used,  waveshaping 
techniques associated with oversampling and appropriate filtering 
give quite good results [1]. The famous pod XT effect processor by 
Line 6 relies on such techniques [15]. 

Anyhow,  we  followed  this  “perceptual”  approach  consisting  in 
emulating  the  different  parts  of  the  electronic  circuit  of  this 
amplifier  using  Web  Audio,  implementing  the  necessary  signal 
processing  algorithms  using  the  available  API,  and  finding 

 
 
adequate solutions to circumvent some limitations specific to the 
Web browser environment (thread priority, latency, JavaScript API 
limitations). Finally, we extensively compared (quantitatively and 
qualitatively)  our  realization  with  the  state  of  the  art,  i.e.  native 
simulations, mostly commercial, written in C++, and not having the 
constraints  of  webapps.  These  results  exceeded  our  expectations. 
Meanwhile, we went on refining the models used in the simulation, 
and  designed a new framework to reproduce different electronic 
architectures  present  in  various  tube  amplifiers  found  in  many 
musicians'  equipment  [17].  We  can  now  simulate  for  example  a 
Fender, a Vox or a Mesa Boogie amplifier, etc. or even create new 
original designs. These customizable simulations have been tested 
by professional guitarists, are being used by music schools on an 
experimental basis and are the subject of a marketing contract by 
the CNRS in order to be included as plugins [18,19] in an online 
commercial DAW (AmpedStudio.com, see Fig. 2).  

Since  2017,  we  have  been  developing  Web  Audio  tube  guitar 
amplifier simulations and tools, including an "amp sim designer" 
that can generate configurations used by an amp sim plugin engine 
that  facilitates  the  process  of  creating  end  user  plugins  for 
musicians. To create each amp sim plugins presented in this demo, 
we proceeded as followed:  we experimented with all the internals 
of our simulation : preamp, tonestack, power amp, reverb, speaker 
simulation stages, by adjusting gains, filters, tube types, number of 
tubes,  internal  topography  of  the  audio  graph,  speaker  impulse 
types, etc. Some stages of these plugins might not be based on high 
level  audio  nodes,  in  particular  when  sample  accuracy  DSP 
processing is needed (like in the power amp stage, where a negative 
feedback loop is present). In that case we used the FAUST DSL to 
generate WebAssembly code [20]. In a second step we created the 
GUI  of  the  plugin,  and  in  a  third  step  we  adjusted  manually  the 
ranges of the different parameters/knobs, by testing and fine tuning 
the  plugin  behavior.  The  plugins  have  been  developed  following 
the Web Audio Modules 2.0 plugin standard [21]. 

2. 
Sound quality of our simulations 
The plugins we developed can be tried with the AmpedStudio.com 
DAW (Fig 3) by creating a track and by adding in the plugin chain 
the AmpSim Utility plugin (Fig. 1) that is useful for adjusting gains, 
selecting  the  left/right  channel  (as  the  guitar  signal  is  generally 
mono),  and  for  activating  a  WebAssembly  multi-channel  noise 
gate.,  then  one  of  the  amplifier  simulators,  eventually  with  other 
audio effects for guitarists. 

It is possible to get a taste of the sound quality provided by these 
plugins by visiting a web page we prepared with dry guitar sounds 
and the same sounds recorded with our plugins1. Only the plugins 
from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 have been used. In addition, several videos 
are available online, showing these plugins in action :

These plugins are now commercialized by our laboratory. They can 
be  seen  as  “premium  versions  with  extra  features”  of  other  open 
source  projects  we  already  published  [16-19].  For  example,  the 
Amp Designer that has been used for designing these plugins, as 
well  as  a  previous  version  of  the  Blues  Machine  amp  simulator 
(named  Distortion  Machine)  plugin  are  available  as  open  source 
projects2 and you can see other videos of these versions3.

Our  simulation  can  be  played  real-time  with  a  real  guitar.  As  of 
today, we recommend for the best experience to use MacOS and a 
low  latency  sound  card.  By  using  a  real  guitar,  we  propose  to 
compare  our  Web  Audio  based  tube  amp  simulation  with  native 
simulations  such  as  Guitar  Rig  by  Native  Instruments  (used  by 
many musicians and guitarists), with GarageBand amp simulations 
and  with  Guitarix,  an  open  source  native  amp  simulator.  The 
referenced papers contain user evaluations showing that the sound 
quality, latency and feeling guitar in hands of these simulations are 
comparable to the state of the art from the native world.
