Abstract

Harnessing worldwide biodiversity data requires integrating myriad pieces of information,
often sparse and incomplete, into a global, coherent data space. To do so, projects like the
Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Catalog of Life and Encyclopedia of Life have set
up platforms that gather, consolidate, and centralize billions of records from multiple data
sources.   This   approach   lowers   the   entry   barrier   for   scientists   willing   to   consume
aggregated   biodiversity   data   but   tends   to   build   silos   that   hamper   cross-platform
interoperability.

The Web of Data embodies a different approach underpinned by the Linked Open Data
(LOD) principles (Heath and Bizer 2011). These principles bring about the building of a
large, distributed, cross-domain knowledge graph (KG), wherein data description relies on
vocabularies with shared, formal, machine-processable semantics. So far however, little
biodiversity   data   have   been   published   this   way.   Early   efforts   focused   primarily   on
taxonomic registers, such as NCBI, VTO and AGROVOC. More recent efforts have started
paving the way for the publication of more diverse biodiversity KGs (Page 2019, Penev et
al. 2019, Michel et al. 2017).

Today, we believe that it is time for more biodiversity data producers to join in and start
publishing   connected   KGs   spanning   a   much   broader   set   of   domains,   far   beyond   just
taxonomic registers. In this talk, we wish to present an on-going endeavor in line with this
vision.   In   a   previous   work,   we   published   TAXREF-LD   (Michel   et   al.   2017),   a   LOD

representation of the French taxonomic register developed and maintained by the French
National   Museum   of   Natural   History.   We   modeled   nomenclatural   information   as   a
thesaurus of scientific names, taxonomic information as an ontology of classes denoting
taxa, and additional information such as ranks and vernacular names. Recently, we have
extended   the   scope   of   TAXREF-LD   to   represent   and   interlink   data   as   various   as
geographic locations, species interactions, development stages, trophic levels, as well as
conservation, biogeographic, and legal status (regulations, protections, etc.).

We put a specific effort into working out a model that accurately accounts for the semantics
of the data while respecting knowledge engineering practices. For instance, a common
design shortcoming is to attach all information as properties of a taxon. This is a rightful
choice for some properties like a scientific name or conservation status, but properties that
actually pertain to biological individuals themselves, e.g. habitat and trophic level, should
better be attched to class members. With the presentation of this work, we wish to advance
the discussion about integration scenarios based on knowledge graphs with the different
biodiversity data stakeholders.
