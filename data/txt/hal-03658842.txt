Abstract: There is a growing acknowledgement that citizen observatories, and other forms of citizen-
generated data, have a signiﬁcant role in tracking progress towards the Sustainable Development
Goals. This is evident in the increasing number of Sustainable Development Goals’ indicators for
which such data are already being used and in the high-level recognition of the potential role that
citizen science can play. In this article, we argue that networks of citizen observatories will help realise
this potential. Drawing on the Cos4Cloud project as an example, we highlight how such networks can
make citizen-generated data more interoperable and accessible (among other qualities), increasing
their impact and usefulness. Furthermore, we highlight other, perhaps overlooked, advantages of
citizen observatories and citizen-generated data: educating and informing citizen scientists about the
Sustainable Development Goals and co-creating solutions to the global challenges they address.

Central to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [1] are the United Nations’
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the associated indicators deﬁned and
set as quality criteria for promoting action at the national, regional and international
levels. The SDGs are also used to evaluate progress in a range of areas contributing to
sustainable development, such as poverty reduction, improvements in health, education
and sustainable growth and the preservation of natural environments, peace, justice and
international cooperation. Reliable, timely, comprehensive and consistent data are essential
to inform processes aimed at promoting and assessing the fulﬁlment of the 2030 Agenda [2].
There is, however, growing recognition that traditional data sources, such as government
surveys, are not sufﬁcient for providing such information [3].

Citizen science provides new means and opportunities for collecting various kinds
of data to monitor the progress towards sustainability. Deﬁned as work undertaken by,
or within, citizen communities with the support and moderation of scientists, educators

and other community stakeholders, citizen science aims to advance science, foster scientiﬁc
literacy and research competence, encourage democratic engagement and participation,
and empower people to join the debate about complex current problems [4]. A growing
body of evidence demonstrates that citizen science is particularly effective at contributing
data to promoting and assessing speciﬁc SDGs and indicators. Some recent theoretical
reviews [5] and empirical studies of active citizen science projects [2,6,7], studying citizen
science’s contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs, have identiﬁed several positive
correlations.

A signiﬁcant number of environmental citizen science initiatives and projects world-
wide are “already contributing” or ”could contribute” to one-third of the SDG indicators,
e.g., by monitoring environmental quality (SDG 6, 13, 14 and 15), or health and wellbe-
ing (SDG 3) [2]. Indeed, citizen science project coordinators show greater conﬁdence in
assessing the impacts of their projects by relating them to speciﬁc SDGs, or by attuning
their methodology to the measurement of speciﬁc SDG indicators [8]. For example, the
FreshWater Watch [9] project, run by Earthwatch, contributes to the speciﬁc SDG indicator
6.3.2 “Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality”, with citizen scien-
tists involved in the project measuring key indicators of their local water bodies’ quality
and uploading the data collected to a global platform. Governments are known to use this
information to understand river water quality, while it also helps to ﬁll data gaps to meet
SDG 6 objectives [10].

Besides engagement in data collection and policy-making, there are further collabora-
tion channels through which citizen science can support the SDGs, including education
and multi-stakeholder partnerships [5]. Indeed, education is an important ﬁeld identiﬁed
in Schleicher and Schmidt (2020)’s analysis of 130 German citizen science projects as to
how they connect to the SDGs [7]. In the study by Moczek et al. [6], “Quality education”
(SDG 4) was among the top SDGs reported to be currently supported through the projects
surveyed.

Nevertheless, citizen science has yet to reach its full potential as a set of non-traditional
scientiﬁc procedures and sources of collective data and as a means for societal participation
and empowerment to monitor global sustainability challenges [11]; cited as having “the
potential to provide credible data to bridge the data gaps [ . . . ] and [ . . . ] enable the
monitoring of SDG environmental indicators” [12]. Moreover, beyond collecting and
analysing data through social participation, citizen science is perfectly positioned to boost
education, partnership, and action for sustainability, through its collaborative nature and
by enriching mainstream school-based activities and approaches. However, most of these
goals have not yet been fully realised.

Supporting citizen science to increase the scope, quality and quantity of citizen-
generated data available for SDG monitoring and reporting and to boost education, part-
nership, and collaborative action for sustainability can be achieved in several ways. One
way is to demonstrate its impact on society, the environment and the economy, as the MICS
(Measuring the Impact of Citizen Science) project [13] does, through an online tool for
impact assessment. A second way, which is the focus of this article, is by creating and
supporting a network of citizen observatories through the development of services and as-
sociated measures, which is the main aim of Cos4Cloud (Co-designed citizen observatories
for the EOS-Cloud), a European Horizon 2020 project [14].

Citizen observatories are community-based environmental monitoring and infor-
mation systems that invite individuals to collect and share observations mainly of an
environmental content, often by mobile phones connected to the internet [15,16]. They
are characterised as including participation of citizens in environmental monitoring and
governance, a bi-directional ﬂow of data and information, “in situ” citizen-generated ob-
servations and the use of mobile and web technologies. However, citizen observatories
face many challenges, such as the sustainability of citizen participation, the quality of
the data generated with respect to the research questions addressed, the management of
participation scalability and platform maintenance costs.

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

The Cos4Cloud project is developing a range of technological services that will enable
the networking of citizen observatories and help address many of the challenges they face.
The Cos4Cloud vision is to boost citizen science through the support of citizen observatories
by improving:
•
•
•

data quality, by simplifying expert veriﬁcation, or using AI to improve identiﬁcation;
data interoperability, by facilitating integration between data sets;
data accessibility, by processing data so they can be more easily uploaded to the
European Open Science Cloud [17] ensuring open access;
the sustainability and maintenance of citizen observatories, for example, through
low-cost tools that can be used, adapted and replicated.

•

As Cos4Cloud partners, we argue here that networks of citizen observatories, meaning
citizen observatories interacting, sharing and learning from and with each other and their
communities of practice around common goals or interests, can aid citizen science in
realising its full potential and contributing to SDG monitoring in three main ways:
•

by capitalising on the interoperability of data, which will lead to larger, integrated and
more useful data sets;
by building on co-design approaches, involving and combining the citizens’ and
researchers’ experience and expertise throughout the project’s life cycle;
by feeding and supporting the education and learning experience of building on,
participating in and contributing to sustainable development and global citizenship
(which is the focus of SDG 4.7, as well as a cross-cutting theme across all SDGs).

•

•

We do this, ﬁrstly, by explaining the methodology that underpins citizen observatories
and how standard or new procedures can contribute to monitoring progress towards the
SDGs. We discuss how networks of citizen observatories build on and enhance the progress
made to date by individual citizen observatories and the limitations of this approach.
Secondly, we demonstrate how projects such as Cos4Cloud can improve and support these
efforts through interoperability, co-design and education, via three case studies: Pl@ntNet
as a service to improve interoperability; co-design as a method to develop services, such
as Cos4Bio, with the users (citizen observatories) in mind; and integration of citizen
observatory technologies into environmental education. Finally, we discuss how these
supported networks of citizen observatories, enhanced by the actions of Cos4Cloud, can be
more effective at contributing to SDG monitoring, at a societal and political level.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Citizen Observatories: Opportunities to Support the SDGs

Citizen observatories can contribute to monitoring progress towards many SDGs. As
mentioned in Section 1, this focuses on their main function, namely engaging citizens in
contributing to the generation and analysis of reliable, timely, comprehensive and consistent
data, based on which progress towards SDGs can be measured. This is enabled through
the direct involvement of citizen scientists in data collection and analysis in a range of
scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Citizen observatory data involve environmental and nature observations
on land use (e.g., LandSense) and biodiversity (e.g., iSpot, Pl@ntnet or Artportalen), up to
astronomy observations leading to the classiﬁcation of galaxies (e.g., Galaxy Zoo). Another
method central to how citizen observatories’ function is by building on citizens’ collective
intelligence, including the “information, experience and knowledge embodied within
individuals and communities” [18].

Despite worldwide political support for the development of citizen observatories,
including by the European Commission, several reservations have been expressed about
the reliability of data obtained via citizen-based observations compared to those obtained
by professional researchers, and the lack of quality standards needed for informed decision-
making and environmental governance. Indeed, there are studies demonstrating limitations
in the scalability and reliability of data collected through citizen observatories [19]. Never-
theless, there is also evidence that the citizen-centred approach used by citizen observatories

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

4 of 17

appears to translate into sustained participation by participants, leading to the generation
of better-quality data [20]. By providing data across vast geographical and temporal scales,
citizen observatories can accumulate new, timely and comprehensive data.

An illustration of the ability and efﬁciency of citizen science to collect high-throughput
and large-scale, research-grade data is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a
biodiversity network and data infrastructure. More than 87% of the data entries published
on the GBIF platform since 2019 consist of citizen science data, compared to an average of
51% of occurrences coming from citizens before 2019. This source has great potential for
addressing some of the data gaps on biodiversity and ecosystem health [11].

2.2. Limitations of the Citizen Observatory Method

Although some citizen observatories can disseminate their data widely through in-
ternational platforms such as GBIF, these represent only a small fraction of all the citizen
observatories worldwide. Most encounter a range of technical, ﬁnancial and administra-
tive difﬁculties that prevent them from contributing their citizen-generated data to such
high-level aggregation platforms. These challenges include: (i) a lack of pathways to make
their data and information available; (ii) a lack of connections, mutualisation and synchro-
nisation between different citizen observatories, meaning that data sets remain largely
fragmented or overlapping; (iii) greater difﬁculty in identifying gaps in data coverage,
because data sets are not connected; and (iv) a lack of expertise or resources to deploy new
technologies efﬁciently, such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics.

These barriers limit the use of citizen observatory data, for example, when establishing
global regulations. As a consequence, the available data for high-level monitoring and
decision-making are strongly biased towards particular regions, taxonomic groups and ac-
quisition protocols; the latter being a methodology for structured data collection, designed
to enable robust statistical analysis in relation to the research question being addressed.
This is even worse for scientiﬁc ﬁelds other than biodiversity (e.g., air quality, water quality,
noise pollution), most of which lack a single platform or infrastructure recognised globally
as the central repository for environmental data.

2.3. The Cos4Cloud Methodology for Improving Citizen Observatory Networks

More signiﬁcant interaction among citizen observatories could improve the usefulness
of their data, and increase the scale and impact of their contribution to monitoring the
SDGs. Cos4Cloud is one of the ﬁrst initiatives to address the challenges faced by citizen
observatories by facilitating citizen observatory networking through interoperability, co-
design and education.

Many citizen observatories collect data to feed the monitoring of the SDGs directly
or indirectly. Cos4Cloud works with nine such observatories, some of which feed into
SDG monitoring directly (such as the previously mentioned FreshWater Watch, which
contributes to SDG indicator 6.3.2 “Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water
quality”) and some of which feed into SDG monitoring indirectly (such as Odour Collect,
a citizen observatory developed to empower citizens to tackle odour pollution and thus
contribute to SDG 3.9.1 “Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution”).
The Cos4Cloud project is developing a suite of technological tools and services to
support and strengthen networking between these different citizen observatories. A full
description of each service is available on the project’s website [14]. Once ready (in 2023),
these will be uploaded to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) as modules, so that
any citizen science observatory can select and install the services it needs to improve
its functionalities. In this way, Cos4Cloud reﬂects Europe’s need for better connections
between the disparate infrastructures developed for different citizen observatories, such as
their data storage and data-sharing mechanisms.

Cos4Cloud will act as a minimum viable ecosystem (MVE) for citizen observatories.
The MVE, a methodology that aims to co-design and co-develop an ecosystem of actors for
citizen observatories proposed by Cos4Cloud, consists of co-designed and prototyped ser-

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

vices to face citizen observatories’ challenges. A key aspect is to ensure that the interactions
among the different components have a synergic beneﬁt for all participating stakeholders.
As shown in Figure 1, there are three main components of the MVE for COs: CO-portals,
experts’ portals, and AI-based automatic-validation tools. The interaction and feedback
among them (coloured arrows) improve the associated services and data quality.

Figure 1. The Cos4Cloud MVE. Starting from a raw observation (1), citizen observatory portals
generate a collaborative validation from the inputs of other participants and suggestions provided by
AI-based automatic-validation tools (2). Community-validated observations (3) are integrated into
different experts’ portals (4), providing a higher level of validation (5). The expert validations provide
feedback and can be grouped into different reference sets (6) that can be used as complementary high-
quality training sets (7) to improve the classiﬁcation capabilities of the AI-based automatic-validation
tools (which in turn will provide better recommendations for future collaborative validations in each
CO) generating high-quality data in global repositories (8).

Thus, the main contribution of Cos4Cloud to SDG monitoring is via networking:
strengthening, enriching and multiplying the work offered by each citizen observatory
alone. This networking will be enabled by: (1) improved interoperability; (2) the use
of co-design; and (3) education and learning for sustainable development. These three
elements are discussed as case studies in the following section, where we explore how
individual citizen observatories are being supported by the technologies developed in the
Cos4Cloud project.

identify plants with their smartphones. It is one of the largest biodiversity observatories in
the world, with several million contributors in over 200 countries.

The general workﬂow of Pl@ntNet is shown in Figure 2 and consists of three main

Figure 2. General pipeline of the Pl@ntNet citizen observatory and its three main components and
processes [22].

Pl@ntNet app: The primary component consists of a plant-recognition application
for smartphones that allows anyone to take a picture of a plant and send it to a server for
recognition, performed by a convolutional neural network [23]. Pictures should be centred
on individual specimens, avoiding strong contrast, as well as the presence of visual noise
(such as ﬁngers or any manufactured objects). The user is returned with a list of candidate
species associated with a conﬁdence score and an adapted illustrative picture enabling the
user to validate a species and share the observation.

Enriching the database: This process aims to improve the observations collected by
the app users. The annotation of the vast volume of data (over four million observations
were shared in 2020) cannot be carried out by expert botanists alone and, therefore, various
crowdsourcing mechanisms are used: the main one integrated within the app itself. In all
views of the application, the users can enrich an observation, either by proposing a new
species name or by voting on the names submitted by other contributors.

Exploitation of the database: In this step, the enriched dataset is (i) used to enhance
the model by re-training it on a larger and more complete dataset, and (ii) made available
for the needs of stakeholders, including both personal (88%) and professional (12%) users.
Pl@ntNet directly contributes to monitoring progress towards several SDG indicators.
Broadly, Pl@ntNet contributes to SDG 15 “Life on Land”, supporting the identiﬁcation
of new species. When an image of a species which is not yet illustrated in Pl@ntNet is
submitted, the AI plant identiﬁcation model usually provides a “no result” message to the
citizen scientist. The citizen scientist can then share their plant observation without any
species name. In this instance, more experienced botanists would have to suggest the most
probable plant species name visible on the image, which would then need to be validated
by the users’ network community. This mechanism has thus allowed for the expansion of
800 plant species illustrated in the ﬁrst version of the Pl@ntNet mobile app (launched in
February 2013), to more than 38,000 plant species in the actual version and more speciﬁcally,
within SDG 2 “Zero Hunger”, Pl@ntNet contributes to the indicators 2.3 and 2.4, which are
related to improving agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems,
respectively, through its use by professional agrarian bodies.

The primary added value of the Cos4Cloud project over the base Pl@ntNet work-
ﬂow is to enable its interoperability with (i) other citizen observatories and networks,
(ii) third-party applications developed by industrial, academic or associative actors, and
(iii) networks of experts and scientists. In this regard, we highlight hereafter two main
achievements.

3.1.1. Pl@ntNet Identiﬁcation as a Service

In the context of Cos4Cloud, Pl@ntNet is developing a RESTful JSON-based appli-
cation programming interface (API), a software interface dedicated to offering a service
to other software, allowing the integration of Pl@ntNet’s visual identiﬁcation engine in
third-party applications. The web service [24] is co-designed and developed through the
collaborative effort of the Pl@ntNet team and the end users of the service, while the API
allows interoperability among the systems which use it. In this way, an application for mon-
itoring the biodiversity of a region can, therefore, use this image-based plant identiﬁcation
service, complete the taxonomical/ecological information disseminated to its users thanks
to the data provided by GBIF or Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) on the species determined,
and enrich the knowledge of the species concerned by sharing these occurrences on the
country’s national biodiversity data aggregation portal.

As illustrated in Table 1, the service offers a diversity of key features facilitating its
integration in a wide variety of contexts. The regularly updated and enriched identiﬁcation
model ensures continuous development and improvement of the Pl@ntNet API. If the
service does not exhaustively cover the plant diversity of interest to a user at the time of
the integration, the user can use the service knowing that it might be able to cover the
species of interest in a future update. The automated rejection of inappropriate content
also facilitates interoperability, normalising and standardising the quality of shared data
and providing assurance to application developers that their users will not be able to share
inappropriate content within their systems or with other platforms.

Functionality

Description

Added Value

Example

Set-valued species
classiﬁcation

The service returns a list of species
corresponding to the query, each
associated with a probability output by
the deep learning model.

The probability output allows
for better quality control in
the downstream applications
provided to end users.

Flora selection
(optional)

This option allows the returned species
to be ﬁltered according to a given ﬂora
(among 41 possible ﬂoras at the time of
writing).

The identiﬁcation quality is
improved, and the service can
be more easily customised for
speciﬁc use cases.

An application may suggest to
its end users to re-submit a
better-quality photo if the
conﬁdence score returned for
identiﬁcation is too low. If the
conﬁdence score is very high,
it can automatically record the
observation for the end user.

An application will not
display a visually similar
species for a given
identiﬁcation request (of the
same genus, for example) if
the species is not within the
selected ﬂora.

Similarity search

For each recognised species, the service
returns the closest pictures to the query
in the Pl@ntNet database.

Multi-images and
multi-organ
observations

Several pictures of the same individual
plant can be provided as input of the
service (particularly photos of the
different organs, including the ﬂower,
the fruit or the leaf).

This allows better quality
control of the identiﬁcation by
the end user. It also provides
access to Pl@ntNet images to
illustrate the species.

Application developers do not
have to manage visual data to
illustrate the identiﬁed species
and can beneﬁt from the data
shared by Pl@ntNet.

The identiﬁcation quality is
improved, and the service can
be more easily customised for
speciﬁc use cases.

A biodiversity monitoring app
can be used whatever the
season or the phenological
stage of the plant.

Secured access with
an API key

The quality of service is monitored
continuously based on several criteria
(status, response time and scalability)
and an alert system allows the
developers to react quickly.

The use of the service requires a token
provided at account creation (with
email validation).

Scalability

Pl@ntNet’s infrastructure and data
management software are highly
scalable.

Service downtime is limited.

An application using this
service can use it at any time.

This highly limits the risk of
attacks.

This limits the risk of denial of
service attacks.

Developers of downstream
applications do not have to
manage the workload
themselves.

A third-party application can
have a peak in usage or a
large increase in users without
causing the service to slow
down.

At the time of publication, 5000 end users have created an account to use the Pl@ntNet
identiﬁcation API, with an average of 500 identiﬁcation queries per account. As indicated,
thanks to the interoperability of the API, the service can be used in a variety of contexts,
many of which support the work of citizen observatories.

Bineo Consulting, a partner in the Cos4Cloud project, is one such user. Bineo is a
developer of web technologies for biodiversity monitoring, including Natusfera: a citizen
observatory adapted from iNaturalist. Within the framework of biodiversity portals, Bineo
Consulting uses the Pl@ntNet identiﬁcation API to facilitate a review of the quality of
observations shared on these portals. Users of these portals can, therefore, validate the
data produced more efﬁciently, accelerating the use of these data in different contexts, both
regulatory and educational. During 2020–2022, Bineo Consulting has requested 50,000
identiﬁcations on this service.

Tela Botanica, a network of 50,000 French-speaking botanists, aims to promote the
exchange of information, and produce open data for the beneﬁt of all botanists, from
amateurs to professionals. This non-governmental organisation has been developing an
information portal on French ﬂora for over 20 years. It offers a personal observation

manager, “le Carnet en Ligne” (the Online Book), which allows its members to produce
and share botanical observations. Through the interoperability of this web software with
the Pl@ntNet identiﬁcation API, users can beneﬁt from identiﬁcation assistance, which
enables them to compare their initial identiﬁcation with the one proposed by Pl@ntNet.

3.1.2. Pl@ntNet Research-Grade Data

As part of Cos4Cloud, Pl@ntNet has developed a pipeline for ﬁltering and sharing
research-grade Pl@ntNet data. These research-grade observations are shared in two main
ways: (i) through the GBIF platform [25], a platform of free and open access biodiversity
data, and (ii) through a web service within Pl@ntNet API. The pipeline to ﬁlter the data
consists of ﬁve key steps.

Firstly, AI-based rejection of inappropriate content is carried out, where any picture of
non-plant entities is automatically rejected. Secondly, AI-based rejection of house plants
and captive plants of the gardens removes species that are not part of the GBIF spectrum
of interest, which focuses on the spontaneous biodiversity of natural or semi-natural
environments. Thirdly, there is AI-based quality control of species names, where only
observations with a conﬁdence score above 90% according to the most recent Pl@ntNet’s
identiﬁcation model are shared, except for observations revised by the community, which
is the fourth step. Here, community-based quality control of species names ensures that
observations revised by the community are shared only if their identiﬁcation reaches a
sufﬁcient degree of conﬁdence. The conﬁdence score is computed according to a weighted
majority voting algorithm, where the weight of each member mostly depends on the
number of species he has observed in the Pl@ntNet database. In this way, the validation of
a plant observation is based on both the evaluation of the image quality and the species
identiﬁcation. The scientiﬁc name of a species can only be validated if (i) the name suggested
by the citizen scientist is registered in one of the taxonomic reference lists provided by
the Pl@ntNet data providers (for example, Kew Gardens); and (ii) scientists with a high
conﬁdence score on their user proﬁle validate the initial determination proposal of the
citizen scientist. Finally, location-based quality control of species names ensures that
observations are only shared when the species name matches the most trusted checklist for
the country/region where the observation was recorded.

The monitoring of Pl@ntNet observations shared with GBIF allows experts who
analyse these data on the GBIF platform to directly access all the information related to
each observation on the Pl@ntNet website. This continuous back and forth, made possible
by the interoperability of the two platforms, encourages case-by-case exchanges between
data producers and analysts. Thus, thanks to this pipeline and improved interoperability
between the Pl@ntNet citizen observatory and GBIF via Cos4Cloud technology, 11 million
research-grade Pl@ntNet observations have been shared within GBIF. Through the GBIF
literature tracking programme, it is possible to query the published research articles using
Pl@ntNet research-grade data (154 articles at the time of publication). Thus, while Pl@ntNet
itself does not provide interpretations on environmental pollution, sustainability or climate
change based on the types of plants growing in an area, the data collected contribute to
such predictions, as evidenced by the literature utilising these data impacting a number of
SDGs, including: new approaches for biodiversity conservation and restoration (SDG 15),
new approaches for invasive species prediction and risk assessment (SDG 15, 2.3 and 2.4),
new approaches for sustainable agriculture and landscape management (SDGs 2.3 and 2.4),
new modelling approaches of the impact of global change on vegetation (SDGs 13 and 15).
Pl@ntNet users are encouraged to produce and share observations of interest for
biodiversity studies thanks to ongoing collaboration with many local and national NGOs
and research organisations with which Pl@ntNet partners. These actors, who promote a
better understanding and protection of biodiversity, encourage the networks of users they
train to implement good practices for identiﬁcation, and also to contribute to less known
and more interesting species for scientiﬁc purposes. This encouragement is formulated
both in the communication materials that they distribute and during face-to-face training

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

10 of 17

sessions. Indeed, face-to-face discussions are integral to the Cos4Cloud methodology
for co-design, described in the following case study 3.2. How Cos4Cloud’s co-design
methodology supports citizen observatories.

Co-design is a collaborative strategy for developing solutions to problems that involve
different types of actors [26]. Collaborative work and collective intelligence, together with
co-creation, participatory design and design thinking, came together to create a set of tools
that support the development of specialised services of Cos4Cloud.

These tools were implemented through a process that begins with the need to under-
stand each observatory’s technological and social conditions, that is, its context and the
user community, in order for the challenges to be solved. It continued with the deﬁnition of
the needs and expectations of the community involved, the ideation of possible solutions,
the prototyping of the idea with its multiple adjustment cycles and, ﬁnally, testing that
helped validate the prototype. This approach considers users as “experts” of their own
experience, and their needs and concerns are central to the design process. In Cos4Cloud,
users are understood from two perspectives: the citizen observatories themselves and the
user communities. This does not mean that the perspectives are artiﬁcially separated; on
the contrary, their combination allows for a greater understanding of the complexity of the
technological ecosystem of the observatories.

Co-design, as a methodological process that guided the construction of services, in
the context of Cos4Cloud, had two main roles: ﬁrstly, to take into account the diversity
and level of involvement of the end users; and, secondly, to facilitate the networking
among citizen observatory communities. The co-design of the observatories scaled or
increased the capacity of the services to respond to the socio-technological challenges that
the observatories faced. This co-design approach was based on three main axes: (1) the
integration of the communities of each observatory; (2) the connection of challenges; and
(3) the co-creation of solutions from the perspective of interoperability.

Integration of the communities: The diversity of geographic scales in which citizen
science observatories operate, added to their possible thematic approaches or the particu-
larities of the project they support, makes these platforms work in some cases as silos, both
at the community and data management levels. Additionally, the governance schemes of
the observatories are not regularly visible, and therefore it is not clear how decision-making
and possible collaboration between observatories and their respective communities operate.
By integrating the nine observatories, Cos4Cloud took advantage of the power of
networking, in addition to co-design, to create a community of co-design. This made it
possible to interact with user communities from various regions of Europe and Colombia
dedicated to environmental and biodiversity monitoring to gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the context of the required technological services and their needs.

During the co-design process, collaborative workshops were held that collected user
stories, identiﬁed needs, prioritised requirements and mapped the expectations of the
observatory communities, promoting potential future collaboration between them.

Connection of challenges: Both citizen science and the technological platforms that
support the management of their data are the subject of relatively recent studies. The
communities that participate in this platform (end users, managers, developers, researchers
and community managers) and those dedicated to studying them are in an initial process
of understanding the socio-technological challenges they face. The governance of data
and infrastructure, the diversity of technologies based on the platform needs, and the
multiplicity of user proﬁles and thematic areas of application, from health to astronomy,
are some of the variables to be considered.

To achieve a greater understanding of these challenges from the reality of multiple
observatories, the Cos4Cloud co-design was approached by an interdisciplinary team that
managed to connect the dimensions of education, technology, communication, engagement
and governance.

Co-creation of solutions: Each observatory has been developed with its own set of
technologies. This technological diversity, added to the lack of categorisation and data

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

11 of 17

transfer standards, made it even more challenging to design technological services useful
for the global community of citizen science observatories. To address this challenge, the
technical teams from each of the nine observatories joined in a single working group that,
hand in hand with the co-design community, co-created and tested multiple technological
solutions.

As a result, the services are co-designed considering interoperability principles and
multiple technological scenarios; they integrate the principles of FAIR data, prioritise
the openness and reproducibility of services through open licences, and are created with
the user in mind. One such service is Cos4Bio [27], whose main mission is to create an
ecosystem that experts in biodiversity related to citizen science can use to carry out searches
and downloads quickly and in a standardised way, generating data sets from different
sources of information, such as citizen observatories. Through co-design workshops,
experts expressed a need for biodiversity data to be searchable by location as well as
species—feedback that has subsequently been implemented into the service.

3.2. How Cos4Cloud Enables Citizen Observatories to Support Education and Learning

The inherent difﬁculty of addressing current environmental and sustainability chal-
lenges requires not only a range of interventions but also the combination and integration
of many interventions at various levels. Citizen science and environmental education can
both address and promote sustainability. In the case of citizen science, this is achieved by:
(1) aiding environmental monitoring and research procedures, (2) raising scientiﬁc and
environmental literacy and (3) promoting global citizenship through the citizens’ active
involvement in real issues. Environmental awareness and participation in policy-making
are equally expected outcomes together with the development of a sense of place. This is
in alignment with how environmental education views its role [28], by emphasising the
need for (a) pedagogical practices that actively engage learners in individual and collective
inquiry processes about current environmental and sustainability issues and (b) learning
experiences that lead to the development of “action competence”, the ability to act based on
the active and critical construction of knowledge, which leads to emancipation and demo-
cratic participation [29,30]. Thus, the concept of environmentally active and responsible
citizenship is a central tenet for both citizen science and environmental education and a
key tool for bringing forth sustainability.

In the Cos4Cloud project, we not only assert that citizen science and environmental
education are compatible and complementary to each other, but also that there is a great
potential for integrating them into school-based practice to support the realisation of
the SDGs. Responsible and active citizenship and informed participation for attaining
sustainability lie at the core of citizen science [31,32]. Likewise, environmental education
departs from engaging with science in the traditional way. It opens up new ways to
learn [33] by emphasising experience, intrinsic motivation, self-directed engagement and
collaboration on a quest to explore and address local sustainability issues and concerns [34].
To this end, it puts forth a pedagogy that involves challenge-based, cross-disciplinary and
action-oriented learning and participation in authentic learning experiences, which take
place in either formal or informal education contexts [35] with the aim to empower young
people to become active and responsible citizens [36].

The Cos4Cloud project builds on the integration of citizen science into formal school
educational processes. Such integration opens up various learning opportunities along
the lines of all SDGs, particularly SDG 4. Moreover, it carries signiﬁcant beneﬁts for the
students and the school communities. Engaging students in collaborative inquiry processes
with a focus on real environmental issues enhances the school community’s openness to
science and participation in local sustainable development efforts [37]. The educational
potential of integrating citizen science into environmental education activities and projects
within schools goes well beyond cognitive outcomes to fostering the students’ scientiﬁc and
environmental literacy and action competence. It aims to cultivate new ways of thinking
and collaborating as a basis for developing active citizenship for sustainability [38]. Rele-

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

12 of 17

vant research [39] shows that engaging students in appropriately designed environmental
citizen science projects within school contexts increases their participation in similar future
initiatives. Likewise, environmental education provides a rich pedagogical context, which
structures and enhances the learning experiences gained from citizen science activities far
beyond contributing to data collection procedures alone.

Alongside the Cos4Cloud project’s initiatives to develop technological services to sup-
port the networking of citizen observatories, there have been sustained efforts to activate
networking within formal education to promote and expand citizen science practice for
sustainability beyond the traditional adult audiences and engage youths, school students
in particular, and as a mode to enrich the quality of education for sustainability. This
strategy was designed to take place across three interconnected actions, through: (1) the
creation of an educational network of teachers, educational stakeholders and schools sup-
portive of integrating citizen science into school-based environmental education practices;
(2) the provision of teacher training programmes and the design of supportive educational
materials to assist teachers in their work; and (3) the implementation of school-based
educational activities, and the evaluation of their learning potential and educational impact
in contributing to achieving SDGs.

In this context, environmental educators were empowered to engage students in
projects focusing on current environmental challenges through citizen observatories such
as Pl@ntnet and Odour Collect. Similarly, students were able to use citizen science-based
technology including the Pl@ntNet-API to not only monitor biodiversity but also support
inquiry-based learning about the sustainability challenges associated with and affecting it.
By facilitating access to species identiﬁcation, participants quickly discover that not only
are there a large number of species around them, but that they make multiple contributions
to the natural and societal environment. Indeed, by training students to use Pl@ntNet,
they become autonomous in exploring the biodiversity of environments outside of school
activities, allowing them to better understand the challenges surrounding it. Cos4Cloud
plans to develop these methods across other citizen science observatories, integrating
citizen science technologies to strengthen education for sustainable development across
Europe.

Thus, while individual citizen observatories can provide a context for citizens’ edu-
cation and learning on local sustainability issues and participation, directly contributing
to SDG 4.7 (Education for sustainable development and global citizenship) and transver-
sally beneﬁtting multiple SDGs by educating citizens on global challenges and the SDGs
themselves, by creating a network of citizen observatories and supporting them with inter-
operable technology through projects such as Cos4Cloud, students are better educated and
engaged, improving the quality and quantity of data collected.

To explore the educational potential of the integration of citizen observatory technolo-
gies into school environmental education, Cos4Cloud coordinated the implementation and
evaluation of ﬁve case studies within Greek schools, during the spring term of 2020–2021.
Of these case studies, four were carried out in secondary schools and one in a primary
school, and four were based on the use of Pl@ntNet, while one focused on Odour Collect.
To support the integration of citizen science into school environmental practice,
Cos4Cloud facilitated the creation of educational scenarios by different groups of Greek
educational designers, including teachers. Each scenario focused on a different theme and
environmental issue, and offered a detailed description of a proposed way of implementing
citizen science in schools, using the project’s citizen observatory platforms. All scenarios
were accompanied by creative and pedagogically informed activities and employed a range
of integrated and interdisciplinary approaches to learning, encouraging students to engage
in action learning and to use the outcomes of their learning to improve their school and local
environments. For example, one scenario, “The magical world of plants—transforming the
schoolyard and protecting life with Pl@ntnet”, focused on the theme of biodiversity, the
issue of climate change as a biodiversity problem, and the designing of a ”green fence” to
absorb noise and chemical pollution, improving their local environment.

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

13 of 17

The ﬁve case studies considered and evaluated a number of these educational scenarios.
For each case study, teachers completed a case study report and evaluation form to describe
how they carried out their educational activities and to share their personal estimations
of what the students had learned from participating in them. The completed forms were
subjected to qualitative content analysis. Although the analysis is still in progress, and
will be published in full at a later stage, there are strong indications that the integration of
Cos4Cloud’s technologies into environmental education had a distinct impact. For instance,
teachers described a range of learning outcomes from the students’ engagement in the
project’s citizen observatory platforms and tools, including the development of new skills
related to their scientiﬁc and digital literacies, or the awakening of students’ senses and
emotions; the nurturing of a sense of connectedness with the environments the students
studied; as well as a new appreciation for nature and the recognition that citizen science
opens up a way to participate and contribute to some broader, global and worthwhile
efforts.

4. Discussion

Citizen observatories can contribute to monitoring progress towards many SDGs.
As we have detailed, the main contribution of Cos4Cloud to SDG monitoring is via the
enhanced networking of citizen observatories through improved interoperability, co-design
and education and learning for sustainable development. These enhancements should
enable citizen observatories to have greater positive impacts at both the societal and political
level.

4.1. Citizen Observatory Networks for Society

The strength of citizen observatories is the potential mobilisation of a large number
of people to make progress towards a common goal. As networks, citizen observatories
provide an enhanced experience: participants feel “part of something bigger” without
losing their connection with local issues. One potential barrier to participation, which
Cos4Cloud addresses through the co-design approach, is the identiﬁcation of typical partic-
ipation proﬁles, so that potential participants can easily see whether the proposed citizen
observatory corresponds to their expectations in terms of objective, level of involvement
and expertise in particular. This helps to limit the possible disappointment of participants
who would not have the means (technical or in terms of availability) to participate, and
maintains active engagement. Furthermore, sustained communication between active
members, and during the training of new members, is facilitated if each actor knows the ca-
pacities and expectations of the other participants, via a functional network of participants
and observatories.

Through the enhancement of citizen observatory networks with Cos4Cloud services,
we aim to reduce the cost of data gathering, which is a signiﬁcant barrier in SDG report-
ing [3] and in citizen science efforts more generally. With the availability of free and widely
accessible web or mobile technologies, citizen observatories encourage the involvement of
new participants, who beneﬁt from new tools to progress in their activities.

Indeed, Cos4Cloud can also support efforts to include low-income groups, especially
those in the Global South. Thanks to the pooling of resources, whether it is data, method-
ological support, or capacity to maintain IT infrastructure or software, the costs of adapting
citizen observatories to new geographical, thematic or linguistic contexts have been re-
duced. This favours their deployment in contexts where we would not have been able to set
them up due to high initial costs. For example, we can cite the Kenyan Lewa Conservancy,
which has set up a citizen observatory for monitoring its ﬂora [40], or the South African
environmental education association iScanTree, based on Pl@ntNet services. Thanks to
previous work to adapt Pl@ntNet services to the European and North African contexts,
the cost of implementing these two new citizen observatories has been greatly reduced.
The web and mobile interfaces for participation were already in place, a number of locally
occurring species were already described and illustrated and training materials for new

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

14 of 17

members were already produced. Because all these services and documents are already
available, the designers of these new citizen observatories have been able to focus only on
the most speciﬁc parts of their contexts and objectives, thus reducing the time needed to
implement them. The drastic reduction in implementation costs partially explains why
actors usually far removed from scientiﬁc activities can become involved in setting up and
running new citizen observatories. Eco-tourism structures, training centres and organisa-
tions in charge of managing territorial areas have thus appropriated the services offered
within the framework of Cos4Cloud’s citizen observatories, adapting them to their needs in
South America, Sub-Saharan or Southern Africa, India or other regions of Southeast Asia.
Finally, the creation and support of networks between teachers and school commu-
nities with citizen observatories are among the activities reinforced by Cos4Cloud. The
development of networking in formal education and informal learning is a key compo-
nent of expanding citizen science and increasing its educational impacts; it is also a key
condition for promoting sustainability and the SDGs. This is most readily sought through
the creation of synergies with school environmental education for sustainability and can
be signiﬁcantly fostered through networking. Empowering citizens, youths in particular,
to actively participate in documenting and reclaiming quality environmental conditions
in their communities involves a great learning potential and stands as a key indicator of
sustainability. The co-design of appropriate educational materials and the provision of
in-service teacher training can signiﬁcantly boost educational networking and all of the
above have been deﬁned as important objectives of the Cos4Cloud project.

4.2. Citizen Observatory Networks for Policy

SDG 17, “Partnerships for the goals: Strengthen the means of implementation and
revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development”, provides a policy framework
that supports public engagement in scientiﬁc research, inclusive of citizen science both as
a research object of policy, and as an instrument of policy [41]. That said, inconsistency
in data quality across citizen science projects and bias among scientists for certain data
sources [42] render citizen science data underused in environmental policy.

Cos4Cloud services aim to improve data quality and thus build trust in citizen science
data, particularly through improved data interoperability. The aforementioned Cos4Bio,
which integrates biodiversity observations from multiple citizen observatories in one place,
and the similarly functioning Cos4Env, which integrates environmental observations, allow
experts in the ﬁelds of citizen science, biodiversity and environmental science to view all
observations in one place. While individual citizen observatories can validate these obser-
vations according to their own speciﬁc algorithms, experts using the service will be able
to search observations from multiple citizen observatories including ArtPortalent, iSpot,
Natusfera and PlantNet and utilise the data for their research. For example, researchers
studying the distribution of a speciﬁc species at the national level could download all the
observations of that species from the service, regardless of the citizen science observatory
or country they come from, breaking down the barriers of validity and accessibility that
prevent citizen science data from feeding into environmental policy.

5. Conclusions

Citizen science is evolving from a ﬁeld dominated by isolated, small-scale, environ-
mental monitoring projects (i.e., local groups focusing on local issues) to one in which
citizen-generated data are more integrated and interoperable and make a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to monitoring progress towards overcoming current great global challenges. Like
scientiﬁc progress in general, citizen science also addresses human needs and concerns. In
addition, there are established projects that already integrate data at a global scale, such
as some of those found on the EU-citizen.science and SciStarter platforms, which enable
participation from anywhere in the world. There is a growing focus, among citizen-science
projects, on the most signiﬁcant challenges of our time.

Sustainability 2022, 14, 4078

15 of 17

The UN 17 SDGs encompass these global challenges but, with just eight years to
go until 2030 (at the time of writing), there is an urgent need to step up efforts towards
achieving them. Networks of citizen observatories, such as those supported and facilitated
by Cos4Cloud, are essential to unlock the potential of citizen science. Such networks
amplify the impact of citizen-generated data and help overcome some of the barriers
to their use (e.g., lack of interoperability and accessibility, and undeﬁned quality). As
discussed in this article, these networks also create further opportunities in measuring
progress towards the SDGs and in achieving them through data interoperability, through
co-design of tools and activities and through education and learning.

This opening up of science, and of the processes through which the global challenges
we face are tracked and measured, is, we argue, even more important than citizen science’s
potential to contribute data to measure this progress. It will not be possible to achieve the
SDGs, or to address the environmental challenges we face, without far more, and more
signiﬁcant, actions from citizens. To put it another way: we do not just need citizens to assist
in monitoring biodiversity loss; we need them to take drastic actions, at the population
scale, to reverse this trend. Similarly, the environmental challenges will not be solved
simply by citizens helping to measure how hot our world is getting; we need those same
citizens, along with all the others, to take the steps needed to reverse current negative
trends. By raising awareness of the challenges we face and the remedial measures that
individuals can take, citizen science is a pathway to motivating society to act towards a
more sustainable future.
