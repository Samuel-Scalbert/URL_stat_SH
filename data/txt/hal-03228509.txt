Abstract:

The inland fisheries sector is central for subsistence in many regions worldwide. The
exploitation of fish resources is expected to increase along with the growing human
population, with underlying conservation issues in regions with high biodiversity value.
The small fishery of the Maroni River, French Guiana, is a hotspot of biodiversity and
endemism where resource depletion is suspected. We surveyed 754 boat landings in
seven villages located in the upper half of the watershed, representing > 6,300 fish
during the study period (November 2013 - September 2014). Fishers used canoes with
outboard engines almost exclusively (75%) and fished within 32 km of their villages.
Most fish were caught in trammel nets (81%); the 20 most-landed species represented
more than 87% of catches. Depending on the village, daily catches and biomass
averaged 6-14 fish and 1.7-13 kg per boat landing, respectively. Seven control sites
located outside of the fishing grounds were fished to identify potential differences in
catch per unit effort and fish size. Per 100 m2 of trammel net, mean catches ranged
from 4-13 and 8-29 fish in the villages and control sites, respectively, while fish
biomass ranged from 0.9-4 and 3.2-7 kg in villages and control sites, respectively. For
all species combined, fish caught at control sites were bigger than those landed in
villages. This difference was significant for nine of the most-landed species.
Differences in fishing techniques and fish catches between villages illustrated the
gradual disappearance of the ancestral subsistence fishing. Our results support
indications that the fish community in the upper Maroni River is harvested intensively,
address the issue of sustainability of the fishery there, and call attention to the need to
conserve the river’s remarkable biodiversity.

1. Introduction  
Small-scale fisheries are an important part of the fisheries sector in coastal marine areas and 
freshwater (Allison and Ellis, 2001; FAO, 2008). They provide many human communities with 
animal protein and income (FAO, 2008; Béné, 2009; Hallwass et al., 2011), but they remain 
difficult to survey. They are usually based on several fish species, many fishing techniques, and 
a  variety  of  landing  sites,  which  make  it  challenging  to  monitor  them  (Salas  et  al.,  2007; 
Chuenpagdee and Pauly, 2008; Castello et al., 2013). The lack of essential information, such as 
fishing pressure and fish stocks, is a clear limitation to developing a sustainable approach to 
small-scale  fisheries  (Dimitriadis  et  al.,  2015).  Usually,  no  data  on  regular  landings  (e.g., 
logbooks, samples, and statistics) exist to assess fish stocks or forecast fishing strategies, unlike 
the  large  amount  of  data  collected  for  larger  commercial  fisheries  worldwide  (Hilborn  and 
Walters, 1992; Gray, 2016). In addition, conventional fisheries science often fails to address 
small fisheries because their social context is usually complex (Berkes, 2003), notably in poor 
or developing countries where subsistence fishing may occur. 

Subsistence fishing is defined as an activity that meets the nutritional needs of the fishers, 
its family and  eventually the community where he lives.  It  usually involves low-technology 
gears, which may be part of traditional or cultural practices, and it is not primary conducted for 
commercial  purpose  (Berkes  et  al.,  2001).  The  current  context  of  globalization,  however, 
enhances new eating habits and the use of more efficient fishing gears such as trammel nets and 
motor boats. In that case, the sale of fish surplus to obtain money in return can be more regularly 
observed,  and  the  line  between  subsistence  and  commercial  fishing  becomes  blurred.  For 
instance, small inland fisheries are key sources of food for many people along large tropical 
rivers (Mosepele, 2014; Begossi, 2010; Welcomme et al., 2010), but some communities have 
started  to  shift  toward  the  consumption  of  commercial  food  products  and  progressively  left 
subsistence fishing for commercial fishing. Therefore, ensuring the sustainability of these small 
inland  fisheries  requires  understanding  the  processes  that  occur  during  the  transition  from 
ancestral to modern lifestyle and their consequences on fish stocks. 

Tropical  regions  host  many  endemic  species  and  high  biodiversity  (Abell  et  al.,  2008), 
which reinforces the need to manage the inland fisheries sustainably for conservation. On the 
Maroni River in French Guiana, the small inland fishery faces the challenges of modernization, 
resource decrease,  and conservation issues. The  watershed hosts 264 strictly freshwater  fish 
species,  of  which  17%  are  endemic  (Le  Bail  et  al.,  2012).  Nearly  60  of  these  species  are 
regularly  fished,  of  which  20  are  endemic.  Despite  the  high  biodiversity  value  of  these  fish 
communities, the fishing pressure there has never been assessed, and no data exist on fish stocks 
and their dynamics. Part of native people still depend on fish resources for their daily diet, and 
several villages and communities are aware of the risk of declining resources, and the potential 
threat to food availability in the future (Longin et al., 2021). Consequently, Parc Amazonien de 
Guyane  (the  French  national  park  of  Amazonia),  which  manages  this  territory,  is  currently 
unable develop suitable management policies to protect fish resources and ensure subsistence 
fishing for people living along the Maroni River.  

The present study aimed to define the small fishery of the upper Maroni River (UMR) by 
bridging  the  information  gap  between  fish  resources  and  fishing  activity.  To  do  so,  a 
conventional fisheries survey (e.g., Pido et al., 1997; Rochet et al., 2008; Cerdeira et al., 2000; 
Hallwass et al., 2011, 2013) was combined with participatory monitoring (e.g., Ticheler et al., 
1998, Silvano and Valbo-Jørgensen, 2008, Rochet et al., 2008; Hallwass et al., 2011, 2013) that 
included native fishers. Our objectives were to map the fishing grounds of several villages in 
the  UMR,  and  analyze  the  abundance  and  biomass  of  fish  landed,  as  well  as  their  seasonal 
variability per species. We estimated potential impacts of the fishery on fish  populations by 
assessing differences in the catch per unit effort (CPUE based on surface of trammel nets) and 
size of catches between villages and remote, control sites located outside the fishing grounds.

We also explored the transition from ancestral to modern lifestyles by comparing the two major 
indigenous  communities  in  the  UMR:  the  native  Amerindian,  who  still  have  a  subsistence 
lifestyle,  and  the  Bushinengue,  descendants  of  African  slaves  who  escaped  and  established 
independent communities, and who recently began to adopt a modern lifestyle (Delpech, 1993). 

2. Methods 
2.1. Study area 
The study was performed in the UMR, a river 610 km long that flows between Suriname and 
French Guiana (Fig. 1). Approximately 5,500 people live in Maripasoula City, the main town 
in  the region,  including  natives from  several  communities and Europeans.  The commune of 
Maripasoula City has a regional airport, and food stores are supplied by plane from Cayenne, 
the capital of French Guiana. Daily fishing activity is low in Maripasoula City, and fish landings 
are difficult to monitor due to the scattered distribution of landing locations. Conversely, daily 
fishing activities occur in 21 small villages located along the UMR. Two communities live in 
the  area:  Bushinengue  (Aluku  ethnic  group)  and  Amerindians  (Wayana  and  Teko  ethnic 
groups), who live downstream and upstream of Maripasoula City, respectively. Bushinengue 
fishers have access to the zone of Abattis Cottica (Fig. 1), which is known to be a productive, 
fish-rich area (Le Bail, personal communication). After reaching agreement with the traditional 
chiefs, we selected seven villages to represent these ethnic groups and the hydromorphological 
characteristics of the UMR watershed (Fig. 1). The landings of 134 fishers (101 Amerindians, 
33 Bushinengue, i.e., 55% of the fisher population) were  surveyed  from  November 2013  to 
September 2014 (Supplementary Table S1). 

2.2. Data collection 
The survey focused on fishing trips that lasted a maximum of 24 h (hereafter, “one-day fishing 
trips”). We did not consider other techniques, such as traditional poisoning using a substance 
derived from lianas or multi-day fishing expeditions, which occur on an occasional basis only 
(Longin  et  al.,  2021).  The  survey  included  four  15-day  sampling  periods:  in  November,  to 
represent  the  end  of  the  long  dry  season;  in  February,  to  represent  the  end  of  the  short  wet 
season;  in  May-June,  for  the  middle  of  the  wet  season;  and  at  the  end  of  August,  for  the 
beginning of the long dry season. To describe all fishing activity adequately, we hired one fisher 
in each village to act as his village’s advisor. The advisor’s role was to collect information on 
daily  catches  during  the  four  periods  of  the  survey.  Advisors  were  trained  for  1-3  days  to 
become comfortable with following the protocol. 

For each boat landing, the power of the engine was noted, and the fisher was asked to locate 
his fishing ground on a grid map (5 km × 5 km squares) with toponyms. The type and number 
of fishing gear in the boat were noted: nets (gillnet or trammel), active lines (hand-held line, 
wooden cane, rod and reel), sight fishing (trident, bow, spearfishing gun, cast-net), or passive 
gear (baited traps, longlines). Length, height, and mesh size were noted for nets, and the actual 
fishing  period  (day  only,  night  only,  or  24  h)  was  noted  for  each  type  of  fishing  gear.  The 
advisor then detailed the daily catches. Each fish was taxonomically identified to the species 
level using a practical illustrated booklet with the 61 largest species living in the Maroni River, 
based on information from Planquette et al. (1996), Keith et al. (2000), Le Bail et al. (2000), 
and Le Bail et al. (2012). Correspondence between scientific names and the Aluku, Wayana 
and Teko common names was based on Grenand et al. (2015). Then, fish total length (nearest 
cm,  from  fish  nose  to  end  of  caudal  fin)  and  weight  (nearest  dg)  were  measured  using  a 
measuring tape and spring balance, respectively. 

Seven control sites located on major tributaries of the UMR (i.e., Litani, Marouini, Tampok, 
and Waki) were surveyed from August 2014 to March 2016 to estimate impacts of the fishery 
on  fish  populations.  A minimum  of  two  days  of  travel  by  boat  was  required  to  access  each 
control site from the nearest village, including exiting the water to pass rapids. Since there was

no other village in the vicinity, we assumed that fishing pressure was very low compared to 
sites around villages. The control sites (Fig. 1) were: Apsik Icholi and Eléüéletpe (64 and 96 
km upstream of Pidima village, respectively), Langa Soula and Wayo Gaan Soula (90 and 126 
km upstream of Antecume-Pata village, respectively), Saut Tampok and Saut Pierkourou (33 
and 130 km upstream of Kayodé village, respectively) and Saut l’Inspecteur (74 km upstream 
of Kayodé). Four to five consecutive nights of sampling were performed at each site, where 
nearly 1 km of river was prospected. The fish community was fished using trammel nets, which 
were set in the evening and checked in the morning. Nets (1.5-2.0 m high, length >30m, 6-22 
cm  inner-outer  panels  mesh  size)  were  chosen  to  match  with  characteristics  of  prevalent 
trammel nets used by fishers in villages, for subsequent comparisons. Nets were positioned in 
deep  or  in  shallow  zones,  with  very  low  flow  or  close  to  turbulent  areas,  parallel  or 
perpendicular to the bankside to cover the range of aquatic habitats available.  The sampling 
effort, expressed as the cumulative length of trammel nets set at night, was 860 m, 1,120 m, 
1,470  m  and  1,690  m  respectively  on  Waki,  Litani,  Tampok  and  Marouini.  Each  fish  was 
taxonomically identified to the species level, then measured (nearest mm) and weighed (nearest 
g).   

2.3. Data analysis 
Only eight boat landings corresponded to 24h fishing trips; the corresponding data were not 
considered  in  subsequent  analysis.  Chi-squared  tests  were  performed  to  identify  significant 
differences  in  numbers  of  one-day  fishing  trips  between  seasons  and  between  communities.  
Data  were  analyzed  to  identify  the  20  most  abundant  fish  species  landed  in  the  fishery. 
Confusion was suspected between Myloplus rubripinnis and M. ternetzi at landing, so the two 
species were considered as a single group (M. rubripinnis/ternetzi) for the rest of the analysis. 
Based on fishing grounds reported by fishers on the grid map, catches located within a 10 km 
radius of each other were then combined to perform maps of catches. For each species, length-
weight  curves  were  plotted;  erroneous  records,  i.e.,  individuals  showing  obvious  mismatch 
between length and weight data, were discarded (1% of data). Moreover, 8% of the fish were 
gutted before landing, and we used the length/weight curves to estimate total weight of the fish. 
Data from trammel nets of similar size (6-22 cm inner-outer panels mesh size, 1.5-2.0 m high, 
length >30m) that were set at night were used to compare the catches of villages and control 
sites. The number of catches was converted into CPUE (i.e., number or biomass of fish caught 
per  100  m2  of  trammel  net  per  night)  for  all  species  pooled.  Although  the  advisors  in  each 
village  were  trained  to  collect  data,  fish  body-length  data  were  marginally  biased  since  the 
caudal  fin  was  sometimes  excluded.  Thus,  fish  weight  data  was  preferred  for  subsequent 
analyses. For all sites combined, fish body-weight distributions by species were divided into 
three equal thirds (small, medium, and large fish), and the percentage of individuals in each of 
the  three  categories  was  calculated  for  each  species.  Data  were  then  aggregated  (all  species 
combined) to assess differences in fish weight between villages and control sites. Differences 
in  fish  body-weight  between  village  and  control  sites  were  also  compared  by  species  when 
catches  of  a  species  reached  at  least  100  fish  in  village  and  100  fish  in  control  site  (sites 
combined) and were distributed equally among seasons. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum 
tests were performed to identify significant differences in species body-weight between village 
and control sites.   

3. Results 
3.1. Fishing grounds 
A total of 647 Amerindian and 107 Bushinengue boat landings were surveyed (Supplementary 
Table  S1).  On  average,  Amerindians  traveled  a  maximum  distance  of  16.5  km  (ca.  45  min 
depending on the flow and outboard engine power) vs. 32.5 km for Bushinengues (90 min).

and  Papaïchton  were  completely  intertwined  and  included  the  zone  of  Abattis  Cottica. 
Conversely,  Amerindian  fishers  preferred  fishing  grounds  within  5-10  km  of  their  villages. 
Some Amerindian fishing grounds overlapped, except for fishers from Kayodé, who fished only 
the Waki and Tampok Rivers (Fig. 1). 

3.2. Fishing techniques 
Regardless of the community, 75% of one-day fishing trips were performed using canoes with 
outboard  engines,  most  of  which  were  10-25  horsepower,  although  a  few  were  40-60 
horsepower (Supplementary Fig. S2). The Bushinengues rarely used paddling (5% on average), 
which the Amerindians used slightly more often (17% on average) to reach fishing  grounds 
near their village, especially in Pidima, Antecume-Pata, and Twenké. Fishers favored the use 
of  nets  (81%)  and  passive  gears  (10%),  active  lines  and  sight  fishing  being  less  observed 
(Supplementary  Fig.  S2).  Passive  gears  were  more  frequently  used  in  Kayodé  (28%  of  the 
fishing  technics  reported),  while  sight  fishing  was  mostly  observed  in  Twenké  (17%  of  the 
fishing technics). The trammel net was the most popular fishing  gear; both the Bushinengue 
and Amerindian communities used 30-50 m long trammel nets of 1.5-2 m high and 6-22 cm 
(inner-outer panels) mesh size.   

The average number of one-day fishing trips per fisher was similar for Amerindians and 
Bushinengues  (Supplementary  Fig.  S3),  but  the frequency  varied  greatly  among  the  fishers: 
some fished almost every day (up to 6 days per week), while others fished less than once per 
week.  The  number  of  one-day  fishing  trips  did  not  differ  among  seasons  (Chi-squared  test, 
p=0.83, Supplementary Fig. S3). Amerindians tended to fish equally at night (55%) or during 
the daytime (45%), while the Bushinengues preferred to fish at night (72%) (Supplementary 
Fig. S3). Night fishing trips lasted ca. 12 h, which generally corresponds to the duration of night 
at the UMR’s latitude; fishers usually set trammel nets at dusk and picked them up at dawn.  

3.3. Fish catches 
The villages landed 63 species throughout the study period, representing 6,366 individual fish. 
The 20 most-landed species represented 87% of individual fish landed (Fig. 2, and see Online 
Supplementary Appendix B for a brief description of each species), of which Pseudancistrus 
barbatus  alone  represented  more  than  12%  of  all  catches  (in  number).  Overall,  59%  of  all 
catches  came  from  three  fish  families:  Serrasalmidae  (25%  -  Myloplus  rubripinnis/ternetzi, 
Myloplus  rhomboidalis,  Myloplus  planquettei,  Tometes  lebaili,  Serrasalmus  rhombeus, 
Acnodon  oligacanthus),  Doradidae  (19%  -  Platydoras  costatus,  Doras  micropoeus),  and 
Loricariidae (16% - P. barbatus, Hemiancistrus medians, Hypostomus gymnorhynchus). The 
large fish Hoplias aimara represented 33% of biomass landed (but only 4% of numbers), while 
all species of Serrasalmidae, Doradidae, and Loricariidae represented 24%, 8% and 4% of the 
biomass landed, respectively. 

For all species combined, nets caught 81% of the fish. However, some species were caught 
mainly  with  other  techniques,  such  as  Hemisorubim  platyrhynchos  (68%  by  longline),  M. 
planquettei (76% by rod and reel, and 11% by spearfishing gun), H. aimara (41% by baited 
traps), A. oligacanthus and H. gymnorhynchus (19% and 15%, respectively, by cast-net), and 
T. lebaili (25% by spearfishing gun). Among the 20 most-landed species, 7 were caught more 
during the dry season, 9 during the wet season, and 4 species were caught evenly in all seasons 
(Fig. 3). 

3.4. Differences in catches between villages and communities 
Amerindians landed 77% of all catches during the survey (Fig. 4), using mostly nets (78% of 
catches,  of  which  96%  were  with  trammel  nets),  passive  gears  (11%,  essentially  longlines) 
active lines (6%), and sight fishing (5%). Bushinengues caught fish using mostly nets (90%, of 
which 93% were with trammel nets), passive gears (7%, essentially traps) and active lines (3%),

and but never sight fishing. For all fishing techniques combined, the mean number of catches 
per boat landing ranged from 6-9 fish in Amerindian villages vs. 13-14 fish in Bushinengue 
villages (Supplementary Table S4). During the entire survey, 2,929 kg of fish was landed in 
total (1,943 kg, i.e. 3.0 kg per boat landing by Amerindian, and 986 kg, i.e. 9.2 kg per boat 
landing by Bushinengue) (Fig.4). Fishers from the Bushinengue village of Papaïchton landed 
the largest fish biomass per one-day fishing trip (13 kg), while other villages landed a mean of 
1.7-4.0 kg (Supplementary Table S4). Amerindians used mainly nets (47%), active lines (13%), 
longlines (35%), and sight fishing (5%) to catch the biomass they landed, while Bushinengues 
used mainly nets (56%), traps (39%), and active lines (5%) to catch the biomass they landed.  
H.  aimara  represented  24%  and  50%  of  the  fish  biomass  landed  by  Amerindians  and 
Bushinengues, respectively, and Bushinengues often caught them with baited traps (54%). Both 
communities successfully used active lines to capture other large fish species (e.g. T. lebaili, 
M. planquettei, M. rhomboidalis, S. rhombeus, B. falcatus) (33% and 8% of the biomass landed 
by  Amerindians  and  Bushinengues,  respectively).  Amerindians  specifically  targeted  H. 
platyrhynchos using longlines and H. gymnorhynchus using cast-nets. Amerindians used sight-
fishing techniques to catch 25% of the biomass of A. oligacanthus and T. lebaili.  

3.5. CPUE and fish body-weight 
The mean area of trammel nets set at night ranged from 72 to 171 m² in Amerindian villages 
(for Pidima and Kayodé, respectively) but reached 338 and 385 m² in the Bushinengue villages 
of  Papaïchton  and  Loca,  respectively  (Supplementary  Fig.  S3  and  Table  S5).  However,  the 
lowest CPUEs (4-7 fish per 100 m2 of trammel net) were recorded at Loca, Papaïchton, and 
Kayodé, while a mean of 8-13 fish per 100 m2 of trammel net were caught in other Amerindian 
villages (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Table S5). In comparison, the CPUE at control sites ranged 
from 8-29 fish per 100 m2 of trammel net (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Table S5). For biomass, the 
lowest yield was recorded at Loca and the highest at Papaïchton (0.9 and 4.0 kg of fish per 100 
m2 of trammel net, respectively), while the yields for Amerindian villages showed intermediate 
values (1.5-3.1 kg). Yields ranged from 3.2-7.0 kg per 100 m2 of trammel net at the control sites 
(Fig. 5B, Supplementary Table S5).  

For all fish species combined, fish caught by trammel nets at control sites tended to be larger 
than fish landed in villages (Fig. 5C) except for Papaïchton and Kayodé. Thirteen species were 
caught  in  sufficient  numbers  to  compare  fish  CPUE  and  body-weight  between  villages  and 
control  sites  (Fig.  6).  No  significant  difference  (Wilcoxon  test,  p>0.05)  was  found  for  five 
species  (Ageneiosus  enermis,  Doras  micropoeus,  H.  gymnorhynchus,  Leporinus  friderici,  S. 
rhombeus);  other  eight  species  were  significantly  lighter  (p<0.05,  Wilcoxon  test)  around 
villages than at control sites (Fig. 6). Mean body mass was particularly lower around villages 
for  Brycon  falcatus  (-146  g,  i.e.  32%  lower),  Cynodon  meionactis  (-41  g,  24%  lower),  M. 
rhomboidalis (-400 g, 64% lower), P. costatus (-179 g, 47% lower), P. barbatus (-28 g, 26% 
lower),  and  Semaprochilodus  varii  (-373  g,  56%  lower).  Weight  differences  were  also 
significant but less pronounced for M. rubripinnis/ternetzi and H. aimara (Fig. 6). 

4. Discussion 
Fish species richness in the tropical freshwater of Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America 
is among the highest worldwide (Abell et al., 2008), which creates regional hotspots with high 
biodiversity  value  and  conservation  issues.  Studies  have  shown  causal  correlations  between 
biodiversity and ecosystem services (Tittensor et al., 2014), and conservation plans commonly 
focus on both issues. Among important ecosystem services, inland fisheries provide low-cost 
protein  in  areas  where  alternative  food  sources  and  employment  are  infrequent.  Poor  or 
developing  nations  generally  rely  the  most  on  these  inland  fisheries,  among  which  the 
importance of high-yield river fisheries has been demonstrated (McIntyre et al., 2016). Such 
small  fisheries  are  challenging  to  study,  however,  since  they  involve  many  fishers,  fishing

techniques, landing sites and fish species (Salas et al., 2007; Chuenpagdee and Pauly, 2008; 
Castello et al., 2013). In addition to ongoing environmental threats (e.g., habitat loss, pollution, 
climate change), intensive harvesting of the most biodiverse rivers is a major concern for the 
conservation and sustainability of these  fisheries. Usually, no data on regular landings (e.g., 
logbooks) exist, as they do for commercial fisheries worldwide, and in the best cases, coarse 
description of fisheries precludes rigorous assessment of effects of fishing on natural resources 
(De Graaf et al., 2015). 

The  upper  Maroni  River  (UMR)  is  a  good  example  of  a  small  continental  fishery  that 
provides subsistence fishing in a context of high biodiversity, including conservation issues and 
suspected  resource  depletion.  Traditional  fishing  techniques  are  documented  for  the  UMR 
fishery  (Hurault,  1985;  Martin,  2014),  but  information  on  the  fishery  remains  mostly  in 
narrative form and geographically limited (Moretti and Grenand, 1982; Chapuis, 1998, Pagezy 
and  Jégu,  2002,  2004;  Richard-Hansen,  2002;  Martin,  2014).  Therefore,  our  detailed 
description of the fishery of the Bushinengue and Amerindian communities could serve as a 
baseline for future monitoring in the following decades. By combining a conventional survey 
and participatory monitoring of native fishers, we assessed potential impacts on fish stocks by 
comparing  yield  inside  and  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  UMR  fishery.  For  all  species 
combined, fish abundance per unit effort was lowest in villages in which large linear nets were 
set up, especially Loca, Papaïchton, and Kayodé. Similarly, fish biomass per unit effort was 
lower around villages than at control sites. 

This apparent decrease in yield in the fishing grounds could indicate intensive harvest, but 
the causal correlation between fishing pressure and fish abundance is not elucidated here since 
we  did  not  consider  other  environmental  pressures  (e.g.,  poor  water  quality,  habitat 
degradation), which could have decreased fish abundance around villages (Longin et al., 2021). 
Moreover, the dominant species in catches may differ among fishing grounds based on  their 
habitat preferences, behavior, and the season. For instance, Prochilodus rubrotaeniatus uses to 
move to feeding grounds downstream (Agostinho et al., 2007), and H. medians remains within 
fast-flowing  habitats  (Le  Bail  et  al.,  2000)  that  are  more  frequent  downstream  of  Loca  and 
Papaïchton  in  the  Abattis  Cottica  (Fig.  1).  D.  carinatus,  L.  friderici,  and  M.  rubripinnis 
preferred lentic environments (authors’ personal observation; Boujard et al., 1991; Planquette 
et al., 1996), which are more common around Elahé and Kayodé. Indeed, caution is necessary 
when  analyzing  aggregated  yield  data  since  they  are  difficult  to  understand  in  multispecies 
fisheries  (Lorenzen  et  al.,  2006).  In  our  case,  catch  per  unit  effort  data  by  species  was  not 
possible since many zero values (i.e., each species was caught in a small number of nets only) 
in the data hampered analysis of differences between villages and control sites. 

Analyzing differences in fish body-weight revealed an additional sign of intensive harvest 
in  the  UMR  fishery.  Several  studies  support  that  prolonged  periods  of  exploitation  are 
associated with both a decline in fish catches and fish size (Haedrich and Barnes, 1997; Froese, 
2004, Hutchings, 2005). Theoretical and empirical studies also illustrate how life history traits 
can be reshaped in harvested fish populations, notably toward slower somatic growth, smaller 
body  size  and  earlier  maturation  of  individuals  (Bouffet-Halle  et  al.,  2021).  All  species 
combined,  we  found  a  decrease  in  fish  weight  classes,  especially  around  the  Amerindian 
villages  of  Pidima,  Antecume-Pata,  Twenké,  and  Elahé  (Fig.  5).  This  general  trend  was 
confirmed by the analysis of spatial differences in body-weight by species. Differences were 
particularly obvious for the large and highly targeted  M. rhomboidalis; fishers rarely landed 
large  individuals  (>0.5  kg),  while  large  individuals  represented  half  of  the  captures  of  this 
species outside the fishery grounds. Individuals of another highly targeted but small species, P. 
barbatus, were 25% lighter around villages than outside the fishery grounds. Similar patterns 
were  observed  for  B.  falcatus  and  P.  costatus,  which  also  suggests  that  these  species  are 
harvested  intensively.  Converging  patterns  of  body-size  declines  were  reported  for  other

neotropical  freshwater  fish  species,  including  Prochilodus  nigricans  (Bonilla-Castilo  et  al., 
2018), Arapaima sp. (Castello et al., 2011b), and several species of Loricariidae, Pimelodidae, 
Scianidae and Serrasalmidae (Castello et al., 2011a). In the Maroni River, H. aimara was the 
largest fish species landed. It was smaller on fishing grounds too, even if the difference with 
control sites was not as stronger as anticipated for this popular species. The influence of a strong 
exploitation on H. aimara body weight could have been masked, however, by the presence of 
larger  individuals  in  large  downstream  habitats,  which  are  more  suitable  for  this  predatory 
species.  

The case of S. varii seems different: small fish were caught almost only inside the fishery 
grounds, suggesting a different age-class distribution across the survey areas. For instance, a 
closely related species that lives in the Amazon watershed, S. insignis, is a migratory species 
that spawns in floodplains (Araujo-Lima and Ruffino, 2003; Goulding et al., 2018). For other 
species  such  as  A.  inermis  and  L.  frederici,  however,  body  weight  did  not  differ  between 
villages and control sites. They were caught mainly during the rainy season, when they reach 
flooded  forests  for  feeding  (Agostinho  et  al.,  2007),  and  it  is  possible  that  long-distance 
movements  of  individuals  between  village  and  control  sites  decreased  differences  in  body 
weight. Moreover, H. gymnorhynchus is a small species (<20 cm long) with an elongated shape 
that is difficult to capture with nets so results for it should be considered with caution. Finally, 
fishers do not target S. rhombeus, an aggressive piranha that lives in deep habitats, because it 
is dangerous and causes serious damage to nets. Therefore, fishing pressure on it would be too 
low inside the fishery grounds to cause differences in body weight. 

For several  reasons,  the exploitation rate in  small-scale fisheries is  expected to  increase. 
Poor communities depend more on freshwater fisheries than on marine or aquaculture sources 
(McIntyre  et  al.,  2016),  and  the  growing  population  generally  increases  pressure  on  natural 
resources. Moreover, there is a general trend for more efficient techniques, and motor boats and 
nets are replacing traditional techniques (Isaac et al., 2004; Castello et al., 2011a; Hallwass et 
al.,  2011).  During  our  investigations  on  the  UMR,  we  observed  traditional  gear  in  fishers’ 
homes, such as bows and arrows, spears, wooden traps, and canes, but they rarely used them. 
Comparing the Amerindian (Wayana and Teko) and Bushinengue (Aluku) communities in the 
UMR  illustrates  this  rapid  transition  from  ancestral  to  modern  lifestyles  in  French  Guiana. 
Bushinengue  began  adopting  a  modern  lifestyle  before  Amerindian  did.  They  rarely  used 
paddling  and  preferred  motor  boats  to  reach  distant  fishing  grounds  during  one-day  fishing 
trips. They usually used trammel nets and caught more fish per fishing trip, but captured the 
fewest fish per unit area of trammel net. Despite the intense fishing pressure in this community, 
fish  are  no  longer  a  main  source  of  protein  in  the  Bushinengue  diet  (Longin  et  al.,  2021). 
Bushinengue  live  in  large  villages  of  more  than  1,000  inhabitants  (Loca  has  ca.  1200  and 
Papaïchton 2900), and fishers represented less than 2% of the population (Supplementary Table 
S1). The annual biomass of landed fish extrapolated from our data is  ca.  14 t, i.e., 10 g per 
person per day. This low intake of animal protein from the river indicates that the Bushinengue 
diet has mostly shifted toward imported and/or processed food, and that subsistence fishing has 
mostly disappeared in their community. Conversely, Amerindians live in smaller villages (35-
180 inhabitants) in which fishers represent nearly 30% of the population, which indicates that 
each family still eats fish from the fishery. The same extrapolation results in an annual biomass 
of  landed  fish  of  27  t,  i.e.,  115  g  per  person  per  day.  Protein  intake  from  the  river  remains 
substantial, but has obviously decreased since the early 1960s, when Hurault (1965) reported 
that the Amerindian Wayana ate 200-560 g of fish per person per day, depending on the season. 
Nevertheless, many native people in the UMR region still depend on fish resources from the 
river for their daily diet, and they are increasingly concerned about the risk of overexploitation 
and resource depletion (Longin et al., 2021). 

5. Conclusion 
Our investigation confirms that a high fishing pressure on fish populations in the UMR region 
is a plausible scenario. Most importantly, we found that yields were consistently low within the 
fishery  grounds,  and  that  some  highly  targeted  species  showed  typical  signs  of  a  prolonged 
period of exploitation, especially a decrease in body weight. Our study focused only on one-
day fishing pressure, but multi-day fishing trips are increasingly popular and are supported by 
powerful motor boats, generators, and freezers that allow fishers to go farther on the river and 
to store fish. Based on the continued increase in the human population (+6.2% per year from 
2011-2016, INSEE, 2019) and the shift from traditional fishing technics to modern and more 
efficient ones, indications that the fish community is harvested intensively should alert local 
authorities  and  managers.  This  seems  to  hold  true  even  in  the  current  context  of  the 
modernization  of  eating  habits  and  progressive  loss  of  subsistence  fishing.  Our  results  call 
attention to the need to  conserve this unique biodiversity of the UMR, and they  address the 
sustainability of  the fishery  there. The participatory approach that we  used  in  this study has 
already  informed  fishers  about  the  intensive  pressure  on  fish  resources  from  their  river,  the 
threat to their unique ecological heritage, and the need to set up management rules toward a 
sustainable fishery in the Maroni River.

Figure 1. Fishery survey of the upper Maroni River (French Guiana). Control sites and fishing 
grounds that correspond to the maximum distance per one-day fishing trips around each village 
are shown. 

Figure 2. (A) Number of catches and (B) biomass landed for the 20 most-landed species by 
main type of fishing gear. 

Figure 3. Percentage of catches for the 20 most-landed species by season. Font colors indicate 
species caught mainly in the dry season (tan), wet season (blue), or throughout the year round 
(black). 

Figure 4.  (A)  Number  of catches  and  (B)  biomass  landed  by  Bushinengue  and  Amerindian 
fishers by main type of fishing gear.  

Figure 5. Spatial distribution of all fish species caught with trammel nets in the village and 
control sites: (A) number of fish per 100 m² of net, (B) fish biomass (in kg) per 100 m² of net, 
and  (C)  fish  body-mass  classes.  Circle  sizes  represent  the  number  of  captures  used  for 
calculations at each site.  

Figure 6. Individual body-weight of the 13 most-landed fish species at control sites (white) 
and village fishing grounds (gray). Error bars represent 1.5 times the interquartile range. Stars 
denote significant differences between village and control sites (Wilcoxon test; * p < 0.05; ** 
p < 0.01).
