Abstract

Diversiﬁcation of cropping systems is a lever for the management of
epidemics. However, most research to date has focused on cultivar mixtures,
especially for cereals, even though crop mixtures can also improve disease
management. To investigate the beneﬁts of crop mixtures, we studied the
effect of different crop mixture characteristics (i.e., companion proportion,
sowing date, and traits) on the protective effect of the mixture. We
developed a SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) model of
two damaging wheat diseases (Zymoseptoria tritici and Puccinia triticina),
which were applied to different canopy components, ascribable to wheat
and a theoretical companion crop. We used the model to study the sensitivity
of disease intensity to the following parameters: wheat-versus-companion
proportion, companion sowing date and growth, and architectural traits. For
both pathogens, the companion proportion had the strongest effect, with

25% of companion reducing disease severity by 50%. However, changing
companion growth and architectural traits also signiﬁcantly improved the
protective effect. The effect of companion characteristics was consistent
across different weather conditions. After decomposing the dilution and
barrier effects, the model suggested that the barrier effect is maximized
for an intermediate proportion of companion crop. Our study thus supports
crop mixtures as a promising strategy to improve disease management.
Future studies should identify real species and determine the combination
of host and companion traits to maximize the protective effect of the
mixture.

Disease management in intensive cropping systems faces nu-
merous challenges: Agrosystem vulnerability to disease outbreaks
is set to increase with climate change and global biodiversity loss
(Carmona et al. 2020; Vˇetrovský et al. 2019); pesticide use comes at
high economic, human health, and environmental costs (Bourguet
and Guillemaud 2016), and pathogens often adapt to resistant cul-
tivars and pesticides (Brown 2015; Hawkins et al. 2019). Diver-
siﬁcation of cropping systems appears to be an important lever
to improve the durability of disease management (Beillouin et al.
2021; Malézieux et al. 2009; Ratnadass et al. 2012). Previous stud-
ies on cereal-based mixtures at the ﬁeld level mainly focused on
cultivar mixtures (Finckh et al. 2000; Mundt 2002; Wolfe 1985).
Disease reduction in cultivar mixtures is based on two important
mechanisms (Burdon and Chilvers 1982; Finckh et al. 2000; Wolfe
1985): the dilution and barrier effects. The dilution effect occurs
when the proportion of the susceptible component decreases, then
diminishing the resource available for the pathogen. The barrier ef-

fect occurs when resistant plants intercept spores on their trajectory,
preventing them from reaching susceptible plants. Other mecha-
nisms are pathogen competition, induced resistance, or disruptive
selection (Borg et al. 2018; Clin et al. 2021).

Three main drivers related to agricultural practices may impact
the efﬁcacy of the dilution and density effects and, ﬁnally, the over-
all protective effect of the mixture. The ﬁrst driver is the genetic
composition of the mixture, determined by (i) the relative propor-
tion of resistant versus susceptible components, (ii) the difference
in the resistance level against the targeted disease between resistant
and susceptible components, and (iii) the number of resistant cul-
tivars. Most studies on cultivar mixtures for disease management
have focused on these characteristics (see references in Borg et al.
2018; Finckh et al. 2000; Huang et al. 2012; Mundt 2002), show-
ing that increasing both the resistant proportion and the level of
host resistance against the targeted pathogen increases the protec-
tive effect across different crops. This includes cereals and wheat
for both airborne (e.g., rust) and rain-borne (e.g., septoria) dispersal
diseases (Ben M’Barek et al. 2020; Borg et al. 2018; Huang et al.
2012; Kristoffersen et al. 2020).

A second driver is the spatial distribution of resistant plants and
organs (i.e., leaves and stems) in the ﬁeld, which is determined
by plant architecture and planting arrangement. Regarding plant
architecture, traits such as plant height and leaf area index (LAI;
m2 m−2) can impact disease severity (Calonnec et al. 2013; Vidal
et al. 2017a) by improving the escape of the host plant from the
spores or spore interception by the companion barrier plant. Re-
garding the barrier effect, this was shown for rain-borne diseases
such as Septoria tritici blotch (Vidal et al. 2017b, 2018), although
this is potentially true for airborne diseases such as rust (Frezal et al.
2009). Planting arrangement has mainly been investigated through
the genotype unit area (GUA), that is, the ground area occupied by an

independent, continuous, and homogenous unit of host genotype
(Mundt and Browning 1985). Most of studies support that decreas-
ing the GUA improves the mixture effect on disease reduction
(Brophy and Mundt 1991; Gigot et al. 2014; Newton and Guy 2009;
Mundt and Browning 1985; Mundt and Leonard 1986).

A third driver that may impact the protective effect of the mixture
is the temporal distribution of resistant plants and organs in the ﬁeld,
which is determined by the sowing date or potentially by different
phenological and plant growth dynamics between the susceptible
and resistant components. The objective here is to synchronize the
presence of resistant host tissue with the pathogen development
and release (e.g., maximizing the barrier effect against spore dis-
persal) and to desynchronize the presence of susceptible host tissue
with the pathogen (Calonnec et al. 2013; Robert et al. 2018). How-
ever, this driver is difﬁcult to explore in cultivar mixtures, as the
desynchronization of cultivars is not desired.

The ﬁndings to date are mainly based on cultivar mixtures,
whereas investigations on crop mixtures for the biological control
of fungal diseases in annual crops are critically lacking. We argue
that cereal-based crop mixtures can be beneﬁcial for cereal disease
management for several reasons. (i) Across cultivars of a given
crop, disease resistance is often quantitative, and the pathogen can
adapt through evolution, meaning that the resistance of a so-called
“resistant” host is never deﬁnitive and complete (de Vallavieille-
Pope et al. 2012; Rimbaud et al. 2021). However, as pathogens are
usually speciﬁc to crop species, a different crop (e.g., legumes)
would be qualitatively and deﬁnitively resistant
to the cereal
pathogen, thus enhancing the protective effect and its durability
against diseases. (ii) Plant architecture and phenology are generally
more contrasted between crop species than between cultivars of a
given crop species (Evers et al. 2019; Gaudio et al. 2019). This can
be an opportunity to maximize the barrier effect against spore dis-
persal and to optimize the synchronicity between epidemics and the
barrier. (iii) Crop mixtures can add other ecosystem services, such
as resource use efﬁciency, quantity and quality yields, soil conser-
vation, and biological regulation of pests and weeds (Beillouin et al.
2021).

These three mixture drivers (i.e., genetic composition and spatial
and temporal distributions) have rarely been investigated simul-
taneously in a single study. Several models have been developed
for cultivar mixtures to quantify (i) the effect of the susceptible-
versus-resistant proportion (Gigot et al. 2014; Jeger et al. 1981;
Mikaberidze et al. 2015; Sapoukhina et al. 2013), (ii) the effect of
plant architecture (Vidal et al. 2018), or (iii) the effect of the GUA
(Gigot et al. 2014; Goleniewski and Newton 1994). However, to
our knowledge, no modeling framework provides the opportunity
to incorporate several drivers. Such a modeling framework would
allow for hierarchizing the main mixture characteristics in terms
of its protective effect and to examine the optimal tradeoffs be-
tween protective effect and yield. Moreover, although the dilution
and barrier effects are frequently referred to in studies investigat-
ing cultivar mixtures for disease management (Borg et al. 2018;
Vidal et al. 2018), these effects and their relative contributions to
the reduction of disease severity are rarely quantiﬁed (Burdon and
Chilvers 1982; Chin and Wolfe 1984). This quantiﬁcation would
allow for optimizing the mixture design by maximizing the barrier
effect while minimizing the dilution effect, which would in turn
maximize both the yield and protective effects.

In this study, we developed a modeling framework based on a
SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) model applied
to different canopy components: wheat and a theoretical compan-
ion crop. The model simulates a single- or mixture-crop canopy,
with parameters describing the wheat-versus-companion propor-
tion, crop growth dynamics, crop architecture, and sowing date.
The SEIR epidemic function was parameterized for two wheat fun-
gal diseases: Septoria tritici blotch (STB; Zymoseptoria tritici), a
rain-borne disease, and wheat leaf rust (WLR; Puccinia triticina),
an airborne disease. We then studied the disease response to the vari-

ations in the companion characteristics. We speciﬁcally addressed
the following questions: (i) To what extent can crop mixtures be
used for the biological regulation of two contrasting wheat fungal
pathogens? (ii) What are the effects and the hierarchy of different
mixture characteristics (i.e., proportion and spatial and temporal
distributions) regarding the overall protective effect? Are these ef-
fects consistent across different weather scenarios? Finally, (iii)
what is the relative contribution of the dilution and barrier effects
in the reduction of diseases in wheat-based crop mixtures?

Materials and Methods

The model aims to investigate how the addition of a non-host crop
species to a wheat canopy can limit two wheat fungal epidemics:
WLR and STB. The model analyzes the impact of the following on
the epidemic dynamics: (i) the wheat/companion proportion (PW:C),
(ii) companion sowing date, and (iii) companion traits relating to
architecture, growth, and phenology. We studied two contrasting
wheat diseases (WLR and STB) to determine how they respond to
these different crop mixture characteristics.

We developed a framework based on a SEIR-like model (Li
and Muldowney 1995) describing canopy growth and epidemic
dynamics during a single crop season (Fig. 1). A canopy is mod-
eled using simple growth functions that represent only one crop or
otherwise two crops in a within-row mixture. The difference be-
tween crop species is ﬁrst deﬁned by disease susceptibility: A crop
susceptible to diseases is deﬁned as wheat, whereas the resistant
companion crop is qualitatively and deﬁnitely resistant to diseases.
There is no explicit spatial structure within the canopy, although
a set of parameters for each crop describes their relative propor-
tion, growth, phenology, sowing date, and canopy porosity. Direct
interactions between plants (e.g., competition and facilitation) and
plant resource dynamics are not considered. The following epi-
demic processes are modeled: tissue infection, latent period after
infection, sporulation of infectious tissues, and the ﬂow of spores
from production to dispersal that subsequently infects the wheat.

Time is measured in degree-days (dd) and denoted by t. Time is
regarded as discrete, indexed by time intervals t of 10 dd with an
experiment duration T (dd). A cropping season starts at tstart with
the sowing date and ends at tend with the harvesting date. T is the
length of the experiment such that T/tend corresponds to the number
of cropping seasons in the experiment. The intercropping season is
modeled as an instantaneous projection from tend to the start of the
next cropping season; in other words, the time between the end of
the current cropping season and the start of the next cropping sea-
son is not explicitly simulated. However, during this time interval,
some state variables are projected onto the start of the next cropping
season with appropriate modiﬁcations. For instance, a fraction of

below). Our model is formalized as a discrete-time analogue of a
continuous-time logistic model.

All abbreviations of the model parameters and state variables are

given in Tables 1 and 2.

The model is implemented in Python 3 and available as open

Healthy crop within-row mixtures

The crop canopy is quantiﬁed in crop LAI (m2 m−2). At each
time step t, for each crop j, and in the absence of disease in the
system, LAIj,t is decomposed in two states according to the SEIR
model: the susceptible surface S (m2 m−2) and the removed surface
R (m2 m−2):

LAI j,t = S j,t + R j,t
The growth dynamics of crop Sj,t are described by a growth func-
tion. Sj,t grows from t = 0 to t = tonto,j, where tonto,j (dd) is the
senescence earliness for crop j. Leaf senescence of crop j occurs
at a constant rate µj. The theoretical canopy growth Sth
j,t with no
disease is given as

where βj is the intrinsic growth rate for crop j, and Kj (m2 m−2) is
the carrying capacity attributed to crop j. At t = 0, c0 is initialized
with Sj,0 = Kj/1,000. The model user must be aware that the discrete-
time analogue of the continuous-time logistic equation can generate
negative recruitment. Therefore, the following conditions must be
respected: 0 < Sj,0 < Kj and βj < 0.

For a healthy canopy, the dynamics of senescent tissues are

described as

R j,t+1 = R j,t + μ jSth
j,t
Eventually, the whole canopy will die once it has completed
its life cycle, at the end of the cropping season. R then equals
LAI.

SEIR function in within-row crop mixtures

In the event of disease in the system, the LAI of the susceptible
crop, LAIW, is decomposed into four states according to the SEIR
model: susceptible surface SW, exposed (i.e., infected but latent) sur-
face EW, infectious surface IW, and senescent and removed surface
RW (all expressed in m2 m−2):

LAIW,t = SW,t + EW,t + IW,t + RW,t
At date tinf, the start date of the epidemic, SW becomes exposed
to the disease. Then, at each time, a quantity SW_inf of susceptible
tissues becomes infected (from SW to IW), and a quantity (cid:2)E→I
of exposed tissues becomes infectious (from EW to IW). SW_inf and
(cid:2)E→I are determined by different infection, spore production, and
spore dispersal state variables and parameters described in detail
below. For STB, the dynamics of IW also depend on the emptying
of pycnids at a rate ψ with rain events such that the emptying of
a given IW surface leads to IW death. Then, the higher the ψ, the
faster infectious tissues will release spores and die thereafter, which
ﬁnally decreases the spore source. Susceptible and exposed tissues
SW and EW become senescent after tonto, whereas infected tissues
(IW) immediately become senescent at a rate µW in all cases. Then,
the general SEIR function is described as follows:

(cid:2)

Spore interception and infection of susceptible tissues

For spore interception by the canopy, we assume two processes
analogous to light interception and absorbance. In the ﬁrst pro-
cess, spores intercepted by the canopy are partitioned between the
wheat and companion crop according to a dominance factor based
on the ERIN (evaporation and radiation interception of neighbor-
ing plants) model (Wallace 1997). Reﬂecting the extent to which a
plant or canopy covers another, the dominance factor then partially
integrates the height difference. Depending on the dominance fac-
tor, the canopy extinction coefﬁcient is partitioned between the two
canopies such that a higher and denser canopy will have a higher
coefﬁcient. The rationale is that taller plants have a theoretically
greater chance of being on the trajectory of a given spore than their
smaller counterparts. In the second process, despite the lack of em-
pirical evidence, we assume that spore interception by the canopy
is analogous to light interception, thus following the Beer-Lambert
law (Barillot et al. 2011).

The spore fraction intercepted by wheat for the two extreme
conditions in which wheat is dominant (fD,W) or is completely
dominated under the canopy (fU,W) is calculated as follows:

fD,W,t = 1 − e−bW ·(SW,t +EW,t + IW,t )

(cid:3)

fU,W,t = e−bC ∗ SC,t ·

1 − e−bW ·(SW,t +EW,t +IW,t )

(cid:4)

with bW and bC being spore interception coefﬁcients for wheat and
the companion crop, respectively, such that the greater the b coefﬁ-
cient, the larger the fraction of intercepted spores. We assume that
SW, EW, and IW for wheat and SC for companion are the surfaces
that intercept spores. Then, the total spore fraction intercepted by
wheat FW depending on its dominance factor DW is given by

FW,t = fU,W,t + DW ·

fD,W,t − fU,W,t

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

with DW as the wheat dominance factor calculated as

DW = hW

hW + hC

with hW and hC as a proxy for the height of the wheat and companion
crop respectively. The fraction intercepted by the companion crop
FC depending on its dominance factor DC is calculated in the same
way as Fw, such that

fD,C,t = 1 − e−bC ·SC,t
(cid:10)

fU,C,t = e−bW ·(SW,t +EW,t +IW,t ) ·
FC,t = fU,C,t + DC ·

fD,C,t + fU,C,t
hC
hW + hC

with fD,C and fU,C as the spore fraction intercepted by the
companion for the two extreme conditions in which the companion
is the most dominant and the most dominated plant, respectively.
Then, εt is the spore fraction intercepted by the entire canopy:

εt = FW,t + FC,t
The number of spores Ng,t intercepted by wheat, which germinate

and lead to lesions on the wheat, is given by
Ng,t = FW,t · πin f · Nsp,t
with πinf as an infection probability factor and Nsp the total num-
ber of spores dispersed (formation explained below). We assume
that these spores spread randomly as follows: The intercepting
canopy fraction is divided into elementary surfaces s0 that repre-
sent the constant lesion size. Then, (SW + EW + IW)/s0 determines
the maximal number of infectious spores that can be intercepted.

Vol. 113, No. 10, 2023 1879

Following a Poisson law, each elementary surface intercepts only
one infectious spore from Ng,t, which then becomes a lesion. The
canopy fraction Fcont intercepting the spores that lead to lesions is
given by

Fcont,t = 1 − exp

The transition from EW to IW, the latent period, is described by
an age-structured vector ηt that represents at t the amount of la-
tent tissues (or lesions) for each lesion age u while considering
their development since their date of appearance. This was of par-
ticular interest given the substantial difference in the latent period
(Précigout et al. 2020a) between WLR (around 100 dd) and STB
(around 200 dd).

The age of latent tissues u increases from 1 to λ + δEI such that λ
is the ﬁxed latent period and δEI is a parameter that considers the
variability of the latent period. This method avoids having infected
tissues (EW) that rapidly begin to sporulate if the transition rate from
EW to IW is constant in time.

The transition from EW to IW is impossible when the lesion age
is in [1; λ − δEI] and progressive when it is in [λ − δEI; λ + δEI],
with the fraction gu increasing to 1 when u increases toward λ +
δEI. Then, for each time t, a fraction gu of η with an age u moves to

Spore dynamics

The dispersal process is different between STB and WLR. For
STB, dispersal occurs through rain-borne pycnidiospores and air-
borne ascospores. Pycnidiospores, which are splash-dispersed dur-
ing rain events, represent most of the spores produced and pri-
marily drive the epidemic during the cropping season. Ascospores
are dispersed by wind, potentially across long distances (Morais
et al. 2016). For WLR, dispersal only occurs through airborne
urediospores.

For both diseases, three spore sources potentially trigger and/or
supply the epidemic: (i) soil, (ii) spore clouds from outside the
canopy, and (iii) spores produced within the canopy during epi-
demics. For both diseases, the model initialization is set with an
initial soil inoculum Spinit and a spore cloud coming from the out-
side of the canopy (Table 1). The main driver for the start of the
epidemic is the initial soil inoculum for STB and spore clouds for

1880 PHYTOPATHOLOGY®

WLR. For STB, the initial soil inoculum is composed of either py-
cnidiospores or ascospores (Morais et al. 2016; Suffert and Sache
2011).

First, there may be spores in the soil or alternative local hosts,
represented by the spore soil reservoir P. At the beginning of the
season, a quantity Spsoil,t from Pt can contribute to the canopy in-
fection. For STB, which is a rain-borne disease, we assume that
the initial inoculum mostly comes from soil and that this soil-based
infection occurs in autumn when the leaves are close to the ground
at the beginning of the growth phase. From date tout, we assume that
the leaves are out of reach of the spores (Garin et al. 2014). Fur-
thermore, leaf infection occurs only during rain events. For WLR,
which is an airborne disease, the disease starts later in the cropping
season during spring after date tinf when the infection begins (Garin
et al. 2014). Then, Spsoil,t is described as follows:

(cid:2)

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

S psoil,t =

Pt
Pt 1t≥tin f for rust

where raint is a Boolean taking the value 1 when expressing a rain
event in time t.

Second, the canopy can also be initially infected or affected by
a spore cloud Spext,t from outside the canopy throughout the crop-
ping season. Spext,t mainly changes according to a ﬁxed parameter,
Spext. At each time step, the fraction of Spext,t that is not retained
by the canopy falls onto the soil and supplies Pt, before supplying
Spsoil,t as described above. This external spore cloud is parameter-
ized for a given period (for 200 dd after growth start tstart) and for a
given interval (every 20 dd), corresponding to the daily and regular
dispersal of spores by wind.

Third, once the epidemic has started, the most important source is
spore production by sporulant tissues Spcanopy. A spore fraction will
also disperse “outside” the canopy, although we assume that this
fraction will be considered in the spore fraction produced and dis-
persed from “outside” and coming into the canopy. Therefore, the
overall spore production is assumed to remain in the canopy in the
current model. As rain-borne spores, pycnidiospores (STB) are dis-
persed during rain events. As airborne spores, ascospores (STB) and
urediospores (WLR) are dispersed at daily intervals (every 20 dd).
Thus, Spcanopy,t is given as follows:

S pcanopy,s,t =

σsIt raint for rain-borne spores
σsIt every 20 dd for air-borne spores
with σs as the spore production rate for each type of spore s.

These three inoculum sources constitute the total number of
spores Nsp,t dispersed and potentially intercepted by and infecting
the canopy at time t:

Nsp,t = S psoil,t + S pext,t + S pcanopy,t
The pool P is supplied by the spore fraction 1 – εt from Nsp,t,
which is not intercepted by the canopy, and by the spore fraction
(1 – πinf)·εt from Nsp,t, which is intercepted by the canopy but does
not germinate and supplies Spsoil as described above. The dynamics
of spore Pt are given by

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

Pt+1 = Pt + (1 − εt ) Nsp,t +

1 − πin f

εt Nsp,t − ρPt − S psoil,t

The different terms of the equation of Pt+1 successively represent
(i) spores not intercepted by crops and falling to the soil, (ii) spores
intercepted by crops but not germinating and infecting and then
falling to the soil or being leached, (iii) spore mortality, and (iv)
spore fraction from the pool P that is re-dispersed. For the tran-
sition from one cropping season to another, we assume that the
reproductive structures that still contain spores empty any remain-
ing spores into the pool P at the end of the cropping season. Then,
we assume that a spore fraction θ of the pool P survives into the
intercropping season:

Quantiﬁcation of disease intensity

Parameterization and initialization

To quantify the disease intensity, we ﬁrst quantiﬁed the cumu-
lated canopy sporulating surface Ivid, which is the cumulated canopy
surface that has already passed through the infectious state I, such
that

Ivid,t =

t(cid:5)

i=0

(cid:2)E→I

Based on Ivid, the AUDPC (area under disease progress curve) is a
more integrated quantiﬁcation of disease intensity, which consid-
ers both the earliness and severity of the disease (Précigout et al.
2017). The AUDPC is calculated as the integral of the infectious
surface I. In our case, it is simply a sum given that we use a discrete
time:

AUDPCt =

t(cid:5)

i=0

Ivid

To keep comparability across experiments with different com-
panion proportions, we standardized all AUDPC values by the
maximum AUDPC with a scenario of pure wheat (such as KW =
K = 6) for a given disease and a given weather scenario (in the case
of STB) by calculating a relative AUDPC:

relative AUDPC = AUDPC
AUDPCKmax

Then, this relative AUDPC varies between 0 and 1 such that the
higher the relative AUDPC, the lower the protective effect of the
mixture and the closer it is to pure wheat.

Wheat growth and phenological parameters were determined by
ﬁtting and calibrating the logistic growth model on previously pub-
lished data (Baccar 2011; Dornbusch et al. 2011). The experimental
design and calibration method are presented in Supplementary
Method S1, and the data are available in the Supplementary Ma-
terial. The same parameters were ﬁxed for the companion crop as
a reference. For the disease, most of the parameters were chosen
(in terms of their order of magnitude) from the literature for WLR
and STB (Baccar et al. 2011; Frezal et al. 2009; Garin et al. 2014;
Pariaud et al. 2009; Précigout et al. 2020b; Robert et al. 2004b,
2005). Some epidemic parameters that are difﬁcult to measure were
unknown and thus estimated from consistency tests (σ, πinf, ρ, θ,
Spext, Spinit). Speciﬁcally, these parameters were chosen so that the
maximum disease severity Ivid at the end of the cropping season
for wheat monoculture did not exceed three-quarters of the LAI
for STB and two-thirds of the LAI for WLR in favorable weather
conditions (Bancal et al. 2007). The sensitivity of disease sever-
ity Ivid to these parameters (Supplementary Fig. S1) was tested in
a biologically plausible range of conﬁdence (−10% and +10%).
All parameters along with their associated literature references or
speciﬁed consistency tests are presented in Table 1.

As a criterion, the interannual variation in SEIR state variables
for pure wheat should be nearly null for a given weather scenario in
order to mimic equilibrium (i.e., roughly equivalent outputs for suc-
cessive cropping seasons). Epidemics were initialized for different
values of the initial inoculum into the soil (Pt=0) for WLR and STB,
as well as for Spext (Table 1). An example of the epidemic dynamics
over three cropping seasons for both diseases in pure wheat and
with 50% of companion crop is illustrated in Figure 2. The model
was developed using Python.

companion species is equivalent to that of the theoretical wheat LAI. For STB, the differences between crop seasons are also driven by different weather conditions.

Simulations

Each simulation corresponds to one cropping season, with the
initial conditions reproducing equilibrium across several cropping
seasons for pure wheat. To test the robustness of the effect of
the companion characteristics on epidemics, we tested different
weather conditions. For STB, rainfall data (but not temperature)
were used for the dispersal of pycnidiospores, based on daily
monitoring at the meteorological station of INRA-Grignon (78850
France). To analyze the effect of rainfall on STB dynamics, we
used the year 1997 as the reference for the average rainfall year,
2000 as the high rainfall year, and 1995 as the low rainfall year. For
WLR, we used the date of the onset of epidemics (tinf) to simulate
the favorable, average, and unfavorable conditions (800, 1,000, and
1,200 dd, respectively; Garin et al. 2018).

Local sensitivity analyses for all parameters

To ﬁrst frame the overall behavior of the model and the sensitivity
to wheat-versus-companion-versus-pathogen traits, we conducted
a local sensitivity analysis for each model parameter p (Table 1).
We investigated how small changes in size (cid:2)p in the value of this
parameter affect the mixture infection rate for the different spa-
tial arrangements. We calculated the relative sensitivity e(p) of the
infection rate to parameter p as per Berghuijs et al. (2020):
= p

· Y (p + (cid:2)p) − Y (p − (cid:2)p)
2 · (cid:2)p

e (p) = p
Y (p)

dY (p)
d p

Y (p)

Then, we considered the variation of I along this range as the dilution
effect alone. Second, we ran 60 experiments of mixtures with the
same total carrying capacity K of 6 m2 m−2, which we assumed to
be the mean wheat LAI in monoculture (Benbi 1994). The carrying
capacity of the wheat and companion crop KW and KC, respectively,
vary such that

K = KW + KC = 6 m2m−2
For the 60 experiments of mixtures, KW ranged from 0 to 6 m2 m−2
and then varied in relative proportions from 0 to 1 with KC. Then,
we considered the variation of I along this range as the addition of
both the dilution and barrier effects.

Based on these two sets of 60 experiments, we decomposed the
barrier effect from the dilution effect for different wheat-versus-
companion proportions PW:C. First, for the pure susceptible stand,
we calculated the protective effect of dilution Edilution as the per-
centage of reduction in the AUDPC distributed in the range of
KW from 0 to 6 m2 m−2 relative to the maximum AUDPC (K =
6 m2 m−2):

(cid:12)

Edilution =

AUDPCpure,K=6 − AUDPCpure,KW
AUDPCpure,K=6

Then, for the mixture, we calculated the total protective effect
of the mixture Etotal as the percentage of reduction in the AUDPC
distributed in the range of KW from 0 to 6 m2 m−2 relative to the
maximum AUDPC found in pure wheat:

(cid:13)

(cid:13)

(cid:12)

AUDPCpure,K=6 − AUDPCmixture,KW
AUDPCpure,K=6

with Y(p) as the infection rate for a given value of parameter p and
(cid:2)p = 0.1p.

Etotal =

Sensitivity of disease intensity to mixture characteristics

To analyze the sensitivity of disease intensity and the protec-
tive effect of the mixture to wheat-versus-companion proportions
PW:C and parameters relating to the companion sowing dates and the
companion architectural and growth traits, we used two approaches.
First, to analyze the continual response of disease intensity to PW:C,
we changed the proportion of the companion crop in the mixture by
including the full range of PW:C divided into 50 steps ranging from
pure companion to pure wheat. We conducted this analysis individ-
ually for each parameter and by varying the parameters between
−50 and 50% from the reference, as this variation was assumed to
be comparable to interspeciﬁc differences (Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. S2). For the sowing date, these variation rates were calculated
relative to the cropping season length.

Second, to analyze the continual response of the disease intensity
to parameters relating to the companion sowing dates and compan-
ion architectural and growth traits, we analyzed the sensitivity of
disease intensity by comparing seven different values of each pa-
rameter individually: −50, −40, −20, reference, 20, 40, and 50%.
We also applied this analysis to ﬁve different proportions of wheat
within the mixture: 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90%.

Regarding the companion crop characteristics, two traits are re-
lated to plant architecture: hC and bC. They respectively change
the dominance level (a proxy of height) and canopy absorbance (a
proxy of leaf density and leaf angle) and then the spore interception
capacity of the canopy. βC, µC, and tonto,C were the growth curve
parameters of the companion crop (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
higher the βC, the sooner the companion crop will reach a large LAI.
The higher the µC, the faster LAI will be lost after tonto,C. The higher
the tonto,C, the longer the period will be with a large or maximum
green LAI.

Dilution-versus-barrier decomposition

To quantify the dilution-versus-barrier effect and its contribution
to the overall protective effect, we compared different scenarios of
two component mixtures with different wheat-versus-companion
proportions PW:C. We ﬁrst ran 50 experiments with the pure wheat
stand evenly distributed in the range of KW from 0 to 5 m2 m−2.

1882 PHYTOPATHOLOGY®

Then, we calculated the protective effect of the companion crop

as a barrier Ebarrier, as follows:

Ebarrier = Etot − Edilution

Results

Overall effects of parameters

Based on local sensitivity analyses for all parameters (wheat,
companion, and pathogen traits), for the top 10 parameters, disease
intensity expressed as the relative AUDPC was most sensitive to
wheat (tonto,W, PW:C, βW, µW, hW) and pathogen traits (tinf, πinf, λ,
σU, ρ) for WLR and to wheat (βW, PW:C, bW, hW), companion (deltaC,
βC, hC), and pathogen traits (πinf, σP, ψ) for STB (Fig. 3). Sensitivity
to companion traits was the weakest of the top 10 parameters (βC
and hC for STB). The relative AUDPC was consistently sensitive to
ﬁve out the top 10 parameters for both diseases (πinf, PW:C, σ, βW,
hW; Fig. 3).

Effect of proportions

For both diseases, there was a general trend with a continual
nonlinear decrease in the relative AUDPC when increasing the
proportion of the companion crop in the mixture (Figs. 4 and 5;
Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). However, there was a difference in
the effect level between both diseases, as the protective effect of the
mixture was slightly higher (lower disease intensity) for STB com-
pared with WLR for a given PW:C. For WLR, the relative AUDPC
was reduced by ∼50% with 25% of companion proportion and by
∼75% with 50% of companion proportion (Fig. 4). For STB, the
effect was slightly stronger, and the relative AUDPC was reduced
by ∼60% with 25% of companion proportion and by ∼80% with
50% of companion proportion (Supplementary Fig. S3).

For both diseases, favorable conditions largely increased the dis-
ease intensity (Supplementary Figs. S5, S6, and S7). However,
favorable, average, and unfavorable weather conditions did not
differently inﬂuence the shape of the AUDPC response to PW:C
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Effect of sowing date and companion traits

Regarding the sowing date (deltaC) and the ﬁve tested companion
traits (hC, bC, βC, µC, tonto,C), most had a substantial effect on the
relative AUDPC for both diseases (Figs. 4 and 5; Supplementary
Figs. S3 and S4). Four types of response were identiﬁed. (i) We
found a linear response of the relative AUDPC with hC and bC,
as increasing the dominance factor and the interception coefﬁcient
decreased the disease intensity (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Fig.
S4A and B). (ii) We observed threshold effects for βC and tonto,C,
as decreasing the growth rate and advancing the start of senescence
in relation to the reference increased the disease intensity, although
increasing these parameters from the reference had mostly no effect
on disease intensity (Fig. 5C and E; Supplementary Fig. S4C and
E). (iii) The response of the relative AUDPC to deltaC was different
for the two diseases due to the different degrees of synchronicity
for the wheat and companion dynamics and the different dates of
infection (start of the growing season for STB versus 800 dd for
WRL). For WRL, both delaying and advancing the sowing date in
relation to the reference increased the disease intensity (Fig. 5F).
For STB, we found a threshold effect, as advancing the sowing date
from the reference had no effect, whereas delaying this parameter
from the reference increased the disease intensity (Supplementary
Fig. S4F). (iv) For both diseases, the mortality rate µC had almost
no effect (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S4D).

The effect on the relative AUDPC was dependent on the param-
eter considered in terms of the sowing date and companion traits.
The strongest effects were found for βC and deltaC. For instance,
decreasing the growth rate by 50% led to an increase of ∼20% in
disease intensity for both diseases (for 50% of wheat in the mix-
ture; Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S4C). Furthermore, delaying the
sowing date by 50% led to an increase of ∼20 to 25% in disease
intensity depending on the disease (for 50% of wheat in the mixture;
Fig. 5F; Supplementary Fig. S4F). Average effects were found for
hC and bC, with ∼10 to 15% variation in the relative AUDPC when
these parameters were decreased by 50% (Fig. 5A and B; Supple-
mentary Fig. S4A and B). For tonto, a rather strong effect was found

for WRL, although it was average for STB (Fig. 5E; Supplementary
Fig. S4E).

For both diseases, the effect of a given companion trait or sowing
date on the relative AUDPC was dependent on the companion pro-
portion, with a null effect for pure wheat or pure companion and a
maximum effect generally with 25 to 50% of companion proportion
(Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S3). Overall, for both diseases, there
was no interaction between weather conditions and trait variations,
as there was no difference in the shape of the AUDPC response to
trait variations for favorable, average, and unfavorable weather con-
ditions (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). For some traits, for both
diseases, the response to trait variations was slightly stronger for a
50% companion proportion and for favorable weather conditions:
hC, bC, βC, and deltaC.

Decomposition of dilution and barrier effects

When decomposing the overall protective effect of the mixture
with regard to the dilution and barrier effects across the range of
wheat/companion proportions PW:C, we found consistent patterns
for both diseases (Fig. 6). The dilution effect was monotonic and
always increased with higher companion proportions, although this
increase was nonlinear as it accelerated toward higher companion
proportions. The barrier effect was non-monotonic, ﬁrst increasing
from 0 to 60% of companion proportion for WLR and from 0 to
45% for STB before decreasing. The overall protective effect was
mostly linear.

Discussion

Here, we present an innovative model of a crop within-row mix-
ture to investigate the impact of fungal epidemics on wheat. The
model supports crop mixtures as a promising method for the bi-
ological regulation of foliar fungal epidemics. It provides some
ideas about the companion characteristics that optimize the protec-
tive effect of the mixture, regardless of the weather conditions. The
proportion of the companion crop in the mixture strongly impacts

disease intensity through a combination of dilution and barrier ef-
fects. The sowing date and companion architectural traits can also
impact disease intensity. The limitations and perspectives of the
model and crop mixtures for epidemic regulation are discussed.

Overall sensitivity of epidemics to model parameters

Regarding the overall sensitivity of epidemics in the model, the
parameters related to wheat architectural and growth traits (hW,
bW, βW, tonto,W) are the strongest determinants. This agrees with
the fact that epidemics are ﬁrst sensitive to resource availability
(described here by green LAI), as the wheat growth rate and start
of senescence determine the duration of green LAI during the crop
season (Calonnec et al. 2013). This ﬁnding is also in line with several
experimental (Burdon and Chilvers 1982; Mundt et al. 2011) and
modeling studies (Garin et al. 2018; Papaïx et al. 2014; Robert et al.
2008, 2018), which demonstrate that resource availability through

green LAI dynamics is a primary driver of epidemics at various
spatial scales (canopy, ﬁeld, an landscape levels). However, resource
availability is determined not only by leaf surface but also by “leaf
quality” through carbon and nitrogen content (Lecompte et al. 2013,
2017; Précigout et al. 2017; Robert et al. 2005). This feature is not
modeled here, although it could be reﬂected by the effect of spore
production rates (σU and σP) in our model, as leaf nitrogen content
drives the spore production rate (Robert et al. 2002).

Epidemics are also sensitive to resource accessibility, that is, the
capacity of spores to reach new healthy leaves as wheat grows during
the season (Calonnec et al. 2013; Garin et al. 2018; Robert et al.
2008, 2018). Relating to wheat traits, this feature is approximated
in our model by the wheat dominance factor and Beer-Lambert
coefﬁcient, which reﬂect the wheat height and canopy porosity to
spores, respectively, and integrate several putative traits that drive
interception, such as plant height, LAI, leaf area density (LAD;

m2 m−3), and leaf angle (Ando et al. 2007; Arraiano et al. 2009;
Calonnec et al. 2013; Madden and Boudreau 1997; Schoeny et al.
2008; Vidal et al. 2018).

Some epidemic parameters were also strong determinants (tinf,
πinf, λ, σU and σP, ψ, ρ). These parameters are directly related to
the efﬁcacy of spore production and dispersal (σU and σP, ψ), as well
as infection (πinf and λ), which are key parameters in the pathogen’s
aggressiveness and overall epidemics (Pariaud et al. 2009; Suffert
et al. 2013).

Impact of wheat-based crop mixtures

The PW:C was the strongest driver controlling disease intensity.
Higher companion proportions were associated with a higher pro-
tective effect, in agreement with several meta-analyses demonstrat-

ing that increasing the non-host proportion in wheat and cereal cul-
tivar mixtures decreases disease intensity (Ben M’Barek et al. 2020;
Finckh et al. 2000; Huang et al. 2012). For both diseases, introducing
a ∼25% companion proportion reduced disease intensity by 50%,
which agrees with the study of Ben M’Barek et al. (2020) on STB.
Therefore, crop mixtures are a promising practice for the biological
regulation of fungal epidemics. Crop mixtures with a different crop
can provide a total and deﬁnitive resistance against some speciﬁc
diseases, whereas cultivars used for biological regulation generally
have resistance that can be overcome on evolutionary timescales (de
Vallavieille-Pope et al. 2012; Rimbaud et al. 2021). Moreover, crop
mixtures can add other ecosystem services, as discussed below.

In terms of the processes, increasing the companion proportion
increases not only the dilution effect but also the barrier effect. Dis-

entangling the dilution and barrier effects explains the nonlinear
relationship between the AUDPC and PW:C for both diseases, as
illustrated in Figure 6. First, as the dilution and barrier effects are
both nonlinear, their addition results in the AUDPC curve. Second,
the nonlinear relationship between the dilution effect and the wheat
proportion mainly reﬂects the Beer-Lambert law underlying spore
interception, which is exponential, as low LAI values disproportion-
ately intercept more spores, whereas larger values are close to the
asymptote. Third, the nonlinear relationship between the barrier ef-
fect and the wheat proportion reﬂects the fact that the barrier effect is
insigniﬁcant for low LAI values of wheat (stronger dilution effect),
as well as for high LAI values of wheat (companion LAI too low to
have a barrier effect). Then, we demonstrated that according to the
PW:C, the barrier effect displays threshold effects, with a maximal
barrier effect around a 60% proportion of companion crop for WLR
and 50% for STB. To our knowledge, two studies have decomposed
the dilution and barrier effects. Burdon and Chilvers (1977) showed
that (i) the barrier effect arises beyond 50% of companion crop and
that (ii) the dilution effect is linear, which is inconsistent with our
results. Chin and Wolfe (1984) showed that at a proportion of 17%
wheat and 83% companion crop, the overall protective effect can
reach ∼80% with the equal contribution of dilution and barrier ef-
fects, which is consistent with our results. This ﬁnding calls for
further quantiﬁcation of dilution-versus-barrier effects.

Identifying these thresholds allows for investigating the optimal
PW:C that maximizes the barrier effect in comparison with the di-
lution effect: For instance, increasing the companion proportion
beyond a certain threshold (here, 60%) has a low marginal protec-
tive effect. This paves the way for maximizing the protective effect
while not diminishing the crop and yield of interest. The optimal
barrier effect will also change with the sowing date and compan-
ion architectural traits (discussed below), as well as with pathogen
dispersal and phenological and aggressiveness traits. The current
model might be an interesting tool for such optimizations.

Impact of sowing date and companion traits

Companion sowing date, growth rate, and start of senescence had
the strongest effects on disease intensity, with a 20% variation in
simulated disease intensity. The companion dominance factor and
Beer-Lambert coefﬁcient had average effects, with a 10 to 15%
variation in disease intensity. However, only the dominance factor
and Beer-Lambert coefﬁcient reduced disease intensity compared
with the reference parameters.

The companion dominance factor and Beer-Lambert coefﬁcient
reﬂect the companion height and canopy porosity to spores, respec-
tively, and integrate several putative traits that drive interception,
such as plant height, LAI, LAD, and leaf angle (Ando et al. 2007;

Arraiano et al. 2009; Calonnec et al. 2013; Madden and Boudreau
1997; Schoeny et al. 2008; Vidal et al. 2018). However, although
the traits driving the dominance factor and Beer-Lambert coefﬁ-
cient must minimize spore interception for wheat, these traits must
also maximize spore interception to maximize the barrier effect of
the companion crop (Vidal et al. 2017a, b, 2018). Accordingly, it
was shown that beyond the absolute trait value of plant height or
LAI regarding spore interception (Arraiano et al. 2009; Madden and
Boudreau 1997; Schoeny et al. 2008), for cultivar mixtures, it is the
difference in plant height and LAI between host and resistant com-
ponents that drives epidemics (at least for STB; Vidal et al. 2017a, b,
2018). Speciﬁcally, a shorter companion with a higher LAI, but the
opposite traits for the host, maximizes the barrier effect. Therefore,
both the host and companion traits should be analyzed together in
future experimental and modeling studies.

It is noteworthy that our results for the dominance factor, which
is a proxy for plant height, are not in agreement with the ﬁndings of
Vidal et al. (2018) regarding STB. Due to the short-distance trans-
port of rain-borne spores through raindrops, as green leaves develop
from the bottom to the top during plant development, shorter ver-
tical distances between leaves increase the opportunities for spores
to colonize (Arraiano et al. 2009; Robert et al. 2018). Then, a pro-
tective effect is favored in mixtures with tall host plants but small
resistant plants (Vidal et al. 2018). This inconsistency strongly ad-
vocates for not only considering spore interception as analogical
to light interception, as the dominance factor is not sufﬁcient to
describe and consider the effect of host and companion heights on
epidemics. First, the different physical processes underlying the dis-
persal of airborne and rain-borne spores can lead to different and
even opposing effects of host and companion heights on the spread
of disease. Second, spores are probably not as ubiquitous as light.
Thus, it may be more relevant to distinguish between the short-
and long-distance dispersal of airborne spores (Aylor 1999; Sache
and Zadoks 1996; Zawolek and Zadoks 1992) or to model splashed
droplets (Saint-Jean et al. 2004; Vidal et al. 2018) instead of spores.
Finally, plant height is generally negatively related to LAD, which
could have confounding effects on spore interception.

Companion sowing date, growth rate, and start of senescence can
increase the duration of the presence of the companion crop in the
model and thus improve the synchronicity between spore dynamics
and the effective barrier on spore dispersal. This is noteworthy in
the context of crop mixtures, as we demonstrated that the barrier
effect is the leading process in the protective effect of mixtures
when the companion proportion is between 0 and 75%. In cultivar
mixtures, this phenological lever is not considered, as growth and
phenological synchronicity between cultivars are favored at harvest
time in standardized systems (Newton et al. 2009).

The lack of effect of the companion mortality rate on disease
intensity indicates that the removed leaf area R is weakly sensi-
tive to mortality rate changes in the current model (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Even in the event of a drastic change in the mortality
rate, which becomes unrealistic, the disease intensity still remains
weakly sensitive (for instance, 8% change for a −90% mortality
rate compared with the reference). This is due to the calculation of
the AUDPC as an integral of the cumulated infectious LAI. Then,
the earlier the start of senescence, the stronger the impact of the
mortality rate will be on disease intensity, measured here as the
relative AUDPC. An in-depth study is required to disentangle the
effect of trait interactions on disease intensity.

Another result is noteworthy: The impact of companion charac-
teristics does not depend substantially on weather conditions for
both STB and WLR. This is a key result for the robustness of
companion trait effects.

Model limitations and perspectives

This model has several limitations and perspectives that im-
prove our understanding of the functioning of crop mixtures for
biological regulation and highlight the reliability of the model
for agricultural applications. First, at present, model calibration
and evaluation, along with the data that allow this task, are criti-
cally lacking regarding crop mixtures for epidemic regulation. The
present model could provide ideas about which experiments should
be prioritized because they are generally time-consuming and ex-
pensive, require disease and LAI monitoring, and limit the number
of factors that can be studied. Based on our model and previous
results on cultivar mixtures, a reasonable strategy is to explore a
diversity of companion crops that reﬂect a diversity of architec-
ture and phenology to maximize the barrier effect. Moreover, the
companion species used in this study was an abstraction with a
growth curve identical to that of wheat and only deﬁned in terms
of its qualitative and deﬁnitive resistance to diseases. Therefore,
real companion species, with contrasted architecture and phenol-
ogy, should be studied to better identify crop species that can be
used in mixtures for effective epidemic regulation, as well as the
combination of traits underlying these crop species. Ground cover
crops can also provide an opportunity to trap spores from rain-
borne diseases and maximize the protective effect (Ntahimpera et al.
1998).

Second, studies of different spatial ﬁeld arrangements (alternate
rows or stripes, chessboard, etc.) is currently lacking (Hernández-
Ochoa et al. 2022), as we only studied within-row mixtures here.
Therefore, the model should be scaled up to the ﬁeld level with
an explicit spatial structure. Third, in the past decades, research
on crop mixtures has largely focused on plant−plant interactions
(i.e., competition, facilitation, complementarity, and compensa-
tion) and their impact on resource dynamics and over-yielding
(Berghuijs et al. 2020; Corre-Hellou et al. 2009; Gaudio et al.
2019; Justes et al. 2021; Louarn and Faverjon 2018). Given that
plant−plant interactions affect the canopy development and struc-
ture and that epidemics negatively impact host resources and
canopy structure (Bancal et al. 2007; Robert et al. 2004b, 2005),
host−companion−pathogen interactions and resource feedback
should necessarily impact the overall epidemics. From this mul-
titrophic perspective, modeling several diseases simultaneously
would also be a step forward (Garin et al. 2018).
