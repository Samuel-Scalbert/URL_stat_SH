ABSTRACT
Linked-data principles are more and more adopted to integrate and
publish semantically described open data using W3C standards
resulting in a large amount of available resources [7]. In particular,
meteorological sensor data have been uplifted into public RDF
graphs, such as WeKG-MF which offers access to a large set of
meteorological variables described through spatial and temporal
dimensions. Nevertheless, these resources include huge numbers of
raw observations that are tedious to be explored and reused by lay
users. In this paper, we leverage WeKG-MF to compute important
agro-meteorological parameters and views with SPARQL queries.
As a result, we deployed a LOD platform as a web application to
allow users to navigate, consume and produce linked datasets of
agro-meterological parameters calculated on-the-fly.

1 INTRODUCTION
Integrating and interpreting meteorological data requires metadata
about the features of interest (e.g. the air), their observed prop-
erties(e.g. air temperature or humidity), the specific location of a
weather station, the time (instant or interval) at or during which
the parameter was measured, and a variety of other information.
In our previous works, we proposed a model for meteorological
data and we built the WeKG-MF knowledge graph of observational
weather data from historical archives of synoptic stations located in
France and its overseas territories [10]. It is compliant with linked
open data best practices [1] and accessible through a SPARQL end-
point1. Since then, we enriched WeKG-MF with basic aggregate
values of weather parameters (e.g., daily min/max temperatures),
not initially included in Météo-France weather reports, based on
official documentation published by the World Meteorological Or-
ganization (WMO) [9] and Météo-France. These aggregate values
were semantically described and integrated as part of the WeKG-MF
graph to serve different needs and studies. In specific domains such
as agriculture, experts are interested in established and significant
parameters such as the total monthly amount of precipitation, the
number of days where the amount of precipitation is higher than
a threshold over a given period, or the monthly average of daily
maximum and minimum temperatures, and others. These agro-
meteorological parameters play a crucial role in determining crop
growth, development and yield and are essential for agricultural
planning, management and decision-making.

In this paper, we present our work to formalize and implement a
set of SPARQL queries to compute agro-meteorological parameters
based on WeKG-MF, and to deploy a LOD platform allowing users
to navigate, consume, visualize and produce linked datasets of agro-
meterological parameters calculated on-the-fly on WeKG-MF. We
also provide an updated presentation of WeKG-MF and its data
model. Section 2 provides an overview of WeKG-MF and highlights
its design principles. Section 3, shows how WeKG-MF enables the
calculation of relevant agro-meteorological parameters based on
a set of SPARQL queries. Section 4 describes the LOD platform
that enables users to calculate and visualize on-the-fly different
agro-meteorological parameters.

2 WEKG-MF OBSERVATIONAL WEATHER

2.2 WeKG Thesaurus of Agro-Meteorological

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

Parameters

In this section we summarize the description of WeKG core model
for linked weather data presented in [10], focusing here on its
enrichment to represent aggregate meteorological features based
on spatio-temporal slices of observations and we present the last
version of the WeKG-MF knowledge graph.

2.1 WeKG Semantic Model
The WeKG model re-uses and extends domain ontologies, among
which the Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) [6]
and Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) [5] ontologies for sensors and
observations, the GeoSPARQL ontology for spatial features and
their relations [3], the Time ontology [4] for temporal entities, and
the RDF Data Cube ontology [8] for aggregation and multidimen-
sionality features. The WeKG model addresses the semantic mod-
elling issues related to meteorological observations and provides a
generic model that can be adopted by weather data providers to pub-
lish their dataset as linked data. It captures the semantics of atomic
and fine-grained weather observations by reusing and extending
SOSA/SSN classes. It meets the specificity of meteorological obser-
vations, including the measurement periods for various weather
properties. In this respect, OWL temporal classes are defined and
reused to describe the measurement period of time of meteoro-
logical observations related to specific observable properties. For
instance, observations related to rainfall indicate precipitations
amounts recorded during the last 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 hours of a spe-
cific synoptic hour2. In WeKG model, depending on the observable
property, it is possible to describe the temporal aspects of a mete-
orological observation using different temporal entities either to
represent the specific synoptic hour of a result or the duration of
measurement interval. At least one temporal entity is attached to
each fine-grained atomic observation. Observations produced by
sensors can rapidly reach enormous volumes. Aggregating them
to create suitable meteorological indicators is a recurrent need in
different domains. In this respect, we reuse the RDF Data Cube Vo-
cabulary (DCV) [8] to describe multi-dimensional data structures.
In our model, we define spatio-temporal slices of observations
by fixing the spatial and temporal dimensions: the spatial dimen-
sion refers to the weather station, while the temporal dimension
corresponds to a calendar interval. An observation (instance of
qb:Observation) in a spatio-temporal slice is represented by a
set of measures (instances of qb:MeasureProperty) each linked
to an observable property with property qb:concept. Although
SOSA/SSN ontologies are commonly used to represent knowledge
about sensor data across domains, the definition of observable
properties and features of interest, as well as their alignment with
existing controlled vocabularies, are delegated to the community
of interest. We established a SKOS vocabulary, guided by the Value
Sets ontology design pattern3 (VS), to represent the potential ob-
servable properties and features of interest in the meteorological
field.

2Main synoptic hours are 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC. Intermediate synoptic hours are 03, 09,
15, 21 UTC

Agro-meteorological parameters calculation leverages both fine-
grained observations and aggregate values calculated over a pe-
riod of time. These parameters include various indicators such
as extreme monthly temperatures, Growing Degree Days (𝐺𝐷𝐷),
cumulative weekly/monthly 𝐺𝐷𝐷, minimum, maximum and aver-
age Growing Season Temperatures (𝐺𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝐺𝑆𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐺𝑆𝑇𝑎𝑣𝑔),
cumulative (weekly/monthly) rainfall, the number of frost/sum-
mer/wet/windy days, average soil temperatures. All of these pa-
rameters are calculated over the growing season period which vary
from one crop to another. Temperatures and precipitations are both
key factors in the viability and growth of crops as well as the yield
quantity and quality. For instance, during the growing season, it is
important for experts to assess the heat accumulation based on the
𝐺𝑆𝑇 and 𝐺𝐷𝐷 parameters. For most plants, phenological develop-
ment stages from seeding to maturity is related to the accumulation
of heat or temperature units above a threshold or base temperature
below which no growth occurs. For instance, in viticulture, during
the growing season that ranges from April to October (Northern
Hemisphere), 𝐺𝐷𝐷 and 𝐺𝑆𝑇 are calculated according to the base
temperature of 10°C. Furthermore, frost events caused by extreme
minimum temperatures can cause damage to emerging buds and
shoots, especially if they occur during the first two months of the
growing season. Also, high rainfall during June can have a negative
impact on grapevine flowering and subsequent grape yield. While
all of the previous assumptions are made for viticulture, changing
to another crop such as wheat implies the same calculation methods
even if thresholds may vary depending on the development stages
defined for a certain crop. We extended the WeKG thesaurus of
meteorological observable properties and features of interest to
include new SKOS concepts that represent the agro-meteorological
parameters. They are formally defined, documented and related to
previously defined concepts.

2.3 WeKG-MF Knowledge Graph
WeKG-MF is a FAIR knowledge graph compliant with the WeKG
semantic model and built from open weather data published by
Météo-France. It now includes 10 years (2012-2022) of historical
weather observations, initially downloadable as CSV files4. The
RDF files are loaded into a Docker-based Virtuoso OS server. The
WeKG-MF generation pipeline is reproducible and the mapping
rules can be customized to meet the needs of other weather data
providers. A documentation is available on our Github repository5.
WeKG-MF allows users to query atomic weather observations
as well as aggregate values pre-calculated and stored in RDF Data
Cubes. Atomic observations and pre-calculated RDF slices are loaded
in different named graphs. An example SPARQL query retriev-
ing daily average temperatures in the french region ‘Nouvelle Ac-
quitaine’ during 2021 is presented in listing 1. An additional RDF
Turtle file describes the WeKG-MF graph using the DCAT6, VOID7
and SPARQL-SD8 vocabularies.

3 COMPUTATION OF

AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS
The WeKG-MF graph is intended to serve different use case sce-
narios in several domains, including agriculture, biodiversity and
climate studies. In the context of the D2KAB French project9, we
identified several competency questions (CQ) that reflect the needs
of experts to understand and compare weather conditions across
years and to study their potential impact on crop growth and plant
disease advent and management. These CQ have guided us to iden-
tify a set of agro-meteorological parameters that can be computed
on WeKG-MF.

The first step towards the computation of agro-meteorological
parameters is to pre-calculate and store aggregate values as RDF
data cubes. We adopted a strategy which consists in combining
several SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries, whose results sets are inte-
grated into the spatio-temporal slice of daily maximum, minimum
and mean air temperatures as well as daily total precipitation. Note
that the WMO documentation [9] indicates methods to calculate
daily total rainfall for the day 𝑅𝑑 as the accumulated amount of
precipitation recorded at a specific day 𝑑 from 6 : 00 UTC till 6 : 00
UTC of the following day 𝑑+1. The same time interval is considered
to calculate the maximum daily air temperatures 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑑 whereas
minimum daily temperature 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑑 are calculated over the time
interval spanning from 18 : 00 UTC the previous day 𝑑 − 1 till
18 : 00 UTC of the day 𝑑.

We implemented these calculation methods in SPARQL and
stored query results as part of the WeKG-MF graph. This allowed us
to find a balance between calculating on-the-fly agro-meteorological
parameters and pre-calculating and storing significant SPARQL
queries results in order to manage the workload of the WeKG-MF
SPARQL endpoint.

As an example, Listing 2 illustrates the SPARQL query to cal-
culate 𝐺𝐷𝐷, 𝐺𝑆𝑇𝑎𝑣𝑔 and total rainfall recorded in French weather
stations (in the Northern hemisphere, lat≥0) during 2021. All of
these agro-meteorological parameters are calculated for the viticul-
ture’s growing season and 𝐺𝐷𝐷 are calculated based on the 10°C
base temperature. A benchmark of 20 SPARQL queries serving as
examples to illustrate how WeKG-MF can be queried is available10.

4 VISUALISATON OF

AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS
In our previous work [2], we developed a Web application which
demonstrates an interactive visualization to explore atomic observa-
tions and slices included in the WeKG-MF graph at different levels of
temporal and spatial details. Besides navigating through the WeKG-
MF graph, we developed new visualisations in order to allow lay
users such as experts in agriculture to easily compute, visualize and
compare agro-meteorological parameters (online demo11).

From a graphical point-of-view, we have developed several fea-
tures to enrich the WeKG-MF users’ experience with the calcula-
tion and visualisation of agro-meteorological parameters. First, an
interactive map augmented with markers indicating geo-spatial
locations of weather stations is displayed (Figure 1a). The user is
able to select a weather station by clicking on its marker and a time
period by selecting two calendar dates indicating the start and end

dates of the growing season. Then, she is able to select one or more
agro-meteorological parameters of interest.

In the current version of our Web application, we defined and im-
plemented 14 different agro-meteorological in SPARQL. As the user
selects parameters, different visualisations are proposed (Figure 1b).
We provide different kinds of visualisations. A first visualisation
shows different line charts, where the x-axis represents time, the
y-axis represents the temperatures and the plots are the timeseries
of daily min/max/avg temperatures. If the user selects daily total
precipitation, the previously chart is updated automatically. This
visualisation allows users to study daily temperatures and rainfall
during the growing season period (top chart in Figure 1c). It is
automatically updated if the user selects another time period.A
second visualisation allows users to compare accumulated GDD
and rainfall (bottom chart in Figure 1c).

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented (1) WeKG-MF, an RDF KG generated
from the meteorological data observations available on Météo-
France’s portal, based on a reusable, formal model exploiting and ex-
tending a network of well-known ontologies; (2) a base of SPARQL
queries to compute a set of aggregators and agro-meteorological
parameter and provide users with synthesized views of the huge
number of measurements included in WeKG-MF. Use cases in the
agronomy and agriculture domains are identified for which WeKG-
MF will be integrated with other knowledge sources in order to
meet expert requirements.
