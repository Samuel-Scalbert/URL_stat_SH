Abstract

Political debates are one of the most salient moments of an
election campaign, where candidates are challenged to dis-
cuss the main contemporary and historical issues in a coun-
try. These debates represent a natural ground for argumen-
tative analysis, which has always been employed to inves-
tigate political discourse structure and strategy in philoso-
phy and linguistics. In this paper, we present DISPUTool 2.0,
an automated tool which relies on Argument Mining meth-
ods to analyse the political debates from the US presidential
campaigns to extract argument components (i.e., premise and
claim) and relations (i.e., support and attack), and highlight
fallacious arguments. DISPUTool 2.0 allows also for the au-
tomatic analysis of a piece of a debate proposed by the user
to identify and classify the arguments contained in the text. A
REST API is provided to exploit the tool’s functionalities.

Introduction
Argumentation in political context has been studied since
antiquity, and it still raises a continuous inquiry given the
challenging topic (Mohammed and Lewinski 2013). The
design of Digital Humanities frameworks to support his-
torians and social scientists in their investigation of politi-
cal discourse through (semi-)automatic approaches to iden-
tify, classify and analyse such a kind of textual content is a
key test-bed for Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods.

The issue of analyzing argument structures through NLP
methods led to a new research field called Argument(-ation)
Mining (AM) (Cabrio and Villata 2018; Lawrence and Reed
2019). AM deals with the ability of identifying argumenta-
tive components (e.g., premise, claim, warrant, backing) and
predicting their relations (e.g., attack, support, undercut, re-
but) in texts to analyze argumentation in various domains.

In this paper, we present a new version of DISPUTool,
a web tool conceived to support humanities scholars in the
exploration and evaluation of textual political debates in En-
glish (Haddadan, Cabrio, and Villata 2019). To the best of
our knowledge, DISIPUTool 2.0 is the only automated tool
which allows to automatically identify and classify argu-
mentative components (i.e., premise and claim) and rela-

tions (i.e., attack and support) from the transcripts of po-
litical debates in English through AM methods. Despite the
plethora of existing AM approaches and annotated corpora,
very few of them apply AM to political text, and none of
them addresses the issue of mining full argument structures
from such texts, supporting intelligent data exploration, as in
DISPUTool 2.0. More precisely, (Menini et al. 2018) predict
relations but in a different setup (i.e., speeches in monolog-
ical form). (Lippi and Torroni 2016) and (Naderi and Hirst
2015) focus on predicting argument relations only. (Duthie
and Budzynska 2018) apply methods to mine ethos argu-
ments from UK parliamentary debates, and (Visser et al.
2020) present a corpus from the political scenario annotated
with the Inference Anchoring Theory (Budzynska and Reed
2011), to extract propositional structures anchored on the
speakers’ locutions.

DISPUTool 2.0 Main Functionalities
DISPUTool 2.0 allows exploring the official transcripts of
the televised presidential debates in the US from 1960 until
2016, from the website of the Commission on Presidential
Debates (CPD)1. It gives also tho possibility to automati-
cally analyze political debates from the argumentative point
of view, trained on the official transcripts of these debates.
More specifically, the functionalities of DISPUTool are the
followings:

US Presidential Debate Argumentative Analysis.
It is
possible to explore the corpus made of 39 US presidential
debates annotated with argumentative components and rela-
tions. When the user selects one of the debates, three argu-
mentative elements are shown: i) the argumentative compo-
nents are highlighted in the textual arguments put forward by
each candidate, and a label ’claim’ or ’premise’ is associated
to these pieces of text (as in DISPUTool 1.0); ii) the relations
holding between the identified components are identified
and labeled to indicate whether it is a support or an attack
relation, and iii) fallacious arguments are highlighted in the
text and associated to one of the following 6 classes of fal-
lacies: ad hominem, appeal to authority, appeal to emotion,
false cause, slogan, slippery slope (Goffredo et al. 2022).
The last two points are peculiar of DISPUTool 2.0.

Analyze Your Debate. The tool offers the user the possi-
bility to paste a political debate in English to identify and
classify the argumentative components and relations (new
from version 2.0) present in the text. The output consists of
the components associated to a label ’premise’ or ’claim’,
and a tabular view of the relations of support and attack hold-
ing between the identified components.

Named Entity Recognition for Political Debates. The
user can search for the Named Entities (NEs) the system
identifies, using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer2
with the possibility to filter the results based on the type
of NE (e.g., religion, location, organization, nationality, and
person), on the year of the debate, and on the speaker.

Experimental Setting and Results
DISPUTool is trained on the ElecDeb60To16 dataset3. The
overall new architecture of DISPUTool 2.04 is visualized in
Figure 1.

Argument Component Detection. For the argumentative
analysis, we adopt the architecture of (Mayer, Cabrio, and
Villata 2020). We cast the argument component detection
task as a sequence tagging problem, using the BIO-tagging
scheme for the pre-trained bidirectional transformer lan-
guage model (Mayer et al. 2021). Thus, the token-level rep-
resentation of contextualized sentences is computed by the
BERT base model (Devlin et al. 2018), fine-tuned during
15 epochs with an Adam optimizer, a learning rate of 6e-5
and a maximum sentence length of 64. The sentence repre-
sentation is passed into a Recurrent Neural Network, i.e., a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU (Cho et al. 2014)) and then into
a Conditional Random Field (CRF (Lafferty, McCallum, and

Pereira 2001)). The dataset splits are 80% for the train set,
and 10% for the validation and test set, respectively. The ob-
tained f1-score on the test set is 0.79.

Relation Prediction. For the relation prediction task, the
sequence classification problem jointly models the relations
by classifying all the argumentative component combina-
tions using a bidirectional transformer architecture. Thus,
the linear layer with a softmax manages this new represen-
tation which allows classifying the identified relations into
three target classes (i.e., Support, Attack and NoRelation).
The base model used with pre-trained weights for the sen-
tence representation is RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019), then fine-
tuned with a learning rate of 6e-5, batch size of 8, maximum
sentence length of 64 sub-words tokens per input example
during 15 epochs. We take into consideration the weight fac-
tor of the 3 classes5 in the weighted Cross Entropy Loss, nor-
malizing the number of training samples of this class. These
settings achieve a macro f1-score of 0.60 on the test set.

DISPUTool 2.0 API To foster versatility and re-usability,
we also enhance DISPUTool 2.0 such that each of the pro-
cessing step (e.g., argument component detection and rela-
tion prediction) can be executed as independent units via our
public available REST API.

Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we presented DISPUTool 2.0, a tool which
allows to automatically analyse political debates from the
argumentation perspective (components, relations, and fal-
lacies). In addition to the visual exploration of the training
dataset of US presidential debates, DISPUTool allows the
user to analyse her own political debate to identify the un-
derlying argumentative structure.

5Due to an high level of unbalancing, we also undersampled the

most represented label, i.e., NoRelation.
