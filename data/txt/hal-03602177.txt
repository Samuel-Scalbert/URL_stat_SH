Abstract
Background:
datasets and databases. Despite these efforts, many studies data are provided using specific and non-standard
formats. This hampers the capacity to reuse the studies data in other pipelines, the capacity to reuse the pipelines
results in other studies, and the capacity to enrich the data with additional information. The Regulatory Circuits project
is one of the largest efforts for integrating human cell genomics data to predict tissue-specific transcription
factor-genes interaction networks. In spite of its success, it exhibits the usual shortcomings limiting its update, its
reuse (as a whole or partially), and its extension with new data samples. To address these limitations, the resource has
previously been integrated in an RDF triplestore so that TF-gene interaction networks could be generated with two
SPARQL queries. However, this triplestore did not store the computed networks and did not integrate metadata about
tissues and samples, therefore limiting the reuse of this dataset. In particular, it does not enable to reuse only a portion
of Regulatory Circuits if a study focuses on a subset of the tissues, nor to combine the samples described in the
datasets with samples from other studies. Overall, these limitations advocate for the design of a complete, flexible and
reusable representation of the Regulatory Circuits dataset based on Semantic Web technologies.
Results: We provide a modular RDF representation of the Regulatory Circuits, called Linked Extended Regulatory
Circuits (LERC). It consists in (i) descriptions of biological and experimental context mapped to the references
databases, (ii) annotations about TF-gene interactions at the sample level for 808 samples, (iii) annotations about
TF-gene interactions at the tissue level for 394 tissues, (iv) metadata connecting the knowledge graphs cited above.
LERC is based on a modular organisation into 1,205 RDF named graphs for representing the biological data, the
sample-specific and the tissue-specific networks, and the corresponding metadata. In total it contains 3,910,794,050
triples and is available as a SPARQL endpoint.
Conclusion: The flexible and modular architecture of LERC supports biologically-relevant SPARQL queries. It allows
an easy and fast querying of the resources related to the initial Regulatory Circuits datasets and facilitates its reuse in
other studies.

Background
Limits to data reusability in life sciences In life science,
there has been a long-standing effort to standardize and
integrate reference datasets and databases [1, 2]. Despite
these efforts, many studies data are provided using spe-
cific and non-standard formats [3]. This hampers the
capacity to reuse the studies data in other pipelines,
the capacity to reuse the pipelines results in other stud-
ies, and the capacity to enrich the data with additional
information [4].

The Regulatory Circuits project The Regulatory Cir-
cuits project [5, 6] is one of the largest efforts for integrat-
ing human cell genomics data. It has been cited 217 times
(Google Scholar – 17 May 2021). Its data originate from
several independent programs such as FANTOM5 [7] and
ENCODE [8], and are aggregated by a complex in silico
pipeline. A major output of these analyses, used in at least
42 other articles, consists in 394 tissue-specific networks
describing the interactions between transcription factors
(TFs) and their target genes in each tissue. From a biolog-
ical perspective, the regulation of a gene by a TF results
from two mechanisms, as TFs can bind to two types of
regulatory regions called promoters and enhancers. The
394 tissue-specific networks are represented by weighted
oriented graphs in which TFs are connected to genes.
They are provided as 394 tabulated files, which differ only
by the values of the weights associated with the interac-
tions (a null value meaning that the considered interaction
is not predicted in the considered tissue). Therefore, the
pipeline complexity lies in the computation of the scores,
which is based on two main features: (i) the combination
of the respective contributions of the enhancer and pro-
moter regions to the predicted strength of the TF-gene
regulation and (ii) the aggregation of the information on
the different samples (from 1 to 33) which constitute each
tissue (808 cell-samples analyzed in total).

The main drawback with the Regulatory Circuits origi-
nal resource is the lack of intermediary results: only the
input files (some with pre-processing) and the result-
ing tissue networks are accessible. The resource does not
describe the specific contributions from the different sam-
ples nor the specific contributions from the enhancers and
the promoters in the tissue networks. Another drawback is
the lack of reproducibility of the pipeline that leads to the
impossibility to compute those intermediary networks.
As the regulation scores in each tissue-specific network
depend on the weights of the enhancers and the promoters
in all the samples, these two drawbacks make it impossi-
ble (i) to update Regulatory Circuits along the successive
releases of the resources it is based on, (ii) to reuse only
a portion of Regulatory Circuits if a study focuses on a
subset of the tissues, and (iii) to combine the Regulatory
Circuits samples with samples from other studies.

Semantic Web technologies Semantic Web technolo-
gies have long been perceived as a relevant framework for
supporting data integration and reuse [9], and have been
widely adopted [10, 11], but some challenges remain to
achieve Web-scale integration [12]. This is of particular
importance as life sciences are on par with other Big Data
domains in terms of data quantity, are probably facing a
higher complexity of data, and this trend is expected to get
worse over the next decade [13].

RDF data structure for the Regulatory Circuits
project. In a previous study [14], we provided an RDF
data repository containing the input of the Regulatory
Circuits resource, consisting of 3,226,341 entities and
335,429,988 relations between them. As an application
case-study, we demonstrated that TF-gene interaction
networks through promoter and enhancer for each cell
sample could be generated on-the-fly with two SPARQL
queries. Those two queries are time efficient to retrieve
the TF-genes relations of enhancer sample-specific net-
works and promoter sample-specific. However, those
queries do not combine the scores from enhancer and
from promoter nor combine the samples constituting a
tissue to obtain its regulatory network. The solution pro-
posed does not store the computed networks and requires
to be computed each time a user may need them. Another
limitation in the use of this resource is the lack of meta-
data. These are necessary to identify the subset of the
samples that meet a user’s specific criteria when reusing
Regulatory Circuits. Overall, these limitations require a
more complete, more flexible and reusable representation
of the Regulatory Circuits dataset.

Expected benefits of RDF technologies In this arti-
cle, we elaborate upon the strategy of [14] to generate a
public RDF resource which contains not only the Regu-
latory Circuits source biological data (already integrated
in [14]), linked to standard Linked Open Data resources,
but also the results of the analysis pipeline at the sample
and tissue-specific layers. The expected benefits are three-
fold. First, instead of only having access to tissue-specific
regulatory networks, it will also be possible to query this
resource from different perspectives. For example, one
may be interested in comparing the targets of a given TF in
different tissue-specific networks, or in determining how
the TFs regulating a given gene vary among networks.
Second, new tissue-specific regulatory networks may be
defined based on the 808 samples from Regulatory Cir-
cuits. This encompasses both specializing a network by
selecting a subset of the samples it is based on, or gener-
alizing a network by adding other samples. Third, it will
allow to combine the data from Regulatory Circuits with
user-specific samples, to extend the resource.

Approach First, we designed the structure of the sample-
specific graphs as well as the SPARQL queries for comput-
ing the weights associated to TF-genes relations. Second,
we designed the structure of the tissue-specific graphs as
well as the SPARQL queries for computing the weights
and scores associated to TF-genes relations based on the
values computed for the samples. Third, we described the
biological data associated to the samples and the tissues,
we complemented them with mappings to external pub-
lic databases, and used them to enrich the original dataset
with an experimental context graph. Finally, we proposed
a modular organization of the aggregated datasets into
RDF named graphs linked by an additional metadata
graph, which allows to identify the relevant portions of the
dataset in order to maintain query performances.

Linked Extended Regulatory Circuits (LERC), a flex-
ible resource to query tissue- and sample-specific
TF-genes interactions . We provide an RDF represen-
tation of the Regulatory Circuits, called Linked Extended
Regulatory Circuits (LERC). It consists in (i) descrip-
tions of biological and experimental context, linked to
the references databases, (ii) annotations about TF-gene
interactions at the sample level for 808 samples, (iii)
annotations about TF-gene interactions at the tissue
level for 394 tissues, (iv) metadata connecting the three
above listed named graphs. Overall, the resource con-
tains 3,910,794,050 triples and is available as a Virtu-
oso endpoint at https://regulatorycircuits-lod.genouest.
org/ [15]. We show how our flexible architecture sup-
ports biologically-relevant SPARQL queries that were not
possible with our previous representation of Regulatory
Circuits’s final results in RDF.

This integration scheme used to construct LERC is
applicable to any similar dataset produced in other
projects.

Methods
All the results presented in the paper were obtained by
relying on Semantic Web technologies. Our strategy was
to create an RDF graph for each different dataset han-
dled in the regulatory circuits project (biological dataset,
experimental context dataset, 394 tissue-specific TF-gene
datasets, 808 sample-specific TF-gene datasets). Then,
the capability of the RDF language to identify groups of
related triples as named graphs was used to link all the
RDF datasets together. This modular design allows (1) to
assign metadata describing each group, (2) to improve
SPARQL queries performances by only considering some
relevant portions of a dataset, (3) to extend the dataset by
adding new groups such as new samples data and (4) to
reuse some portions of the dataset in other studies. Note
that this addresses the limits to data reusability identified
at the beginning of the Background section.

Biological data from Regulatory circuits
The Regulatory Circuits website and supplementary data
give access to unstructured, disconnected and diversely
formatted tabulated files related either to input biolog-
ical data (FANTOM5 data, genes and regions genomic
coordinates, TFs binding sites occurrences...) or compu-
tation intermediate results (59 files). The main output of
the in silico analyses resulting from the Regulatory Cir-
cuits project consists in maps (called networks) describing
interactions between TFs and their target genes in each of
the 394 studied tissues.

Each network is described by an oriented graph in which
TFs are connected to genes. The nodes are annotated
with biological information (gene IDs for both TFs and
target genes). The edges are annotated with a unique
score aggregating two different weights representing the
respective contributions of the enhancer and promoter
regions to the predicted strength of the TF-gene regula-
tion. These respective contributions as well as the formula
used to compute the final score are neither described nor
available. These 394 tissue-specific TF-gene interaction
networks are provided as tabulated files, and the pipeline
to produce them is neither usable nor reproducible.

Biological data RDF graph
The biological data graph contains the minimal set of
biological entities required to build the Regulatory Cir-
cuits networks together with their attributes (values), and
describes the relations between these entities. As detailed
in [14] and depicted in Fig. 1, it is based on five main types
of biological entities: three related to genes or proteins
(gene, transcript, TF) and two related to chromosomal
regulation regions (promoter, enhancer), connected by
five reified relations (see below).

The identifiers of genes (19,125 instances of the class
Gene), transcripts (53,549 instances of the class Tran-
script) and transcription factors (691 instances of the
class TF) are constructed based on the names provided
by the Regulatory Circuits datasets (HGNC reference
identifiers for TF and Gene, Ensembl transcript names
for Transcript). These identifiers are linked to identi-
fiers from external databases such as UniProtKB [16]
(release 2021_04) and Ensembl [17] (release 104) as fol-
lows. Genes are associated to the UniProt identifier of
their reviewed proteins; in case of several proteins being
reviewed for a gene, the longest one is selected. Both genes
and transcripts are associated to their Ensembl identifiers
as already available in Regulatory Circuits datasets.

There are two classes of regulatory regions: Promoter

(184,828 entities) and Enhancer (43,011 entities).

The dataset comprises five types of reified rela-
tions: two between TFs and regulatory regions weighed
by the confidence of transcription factor binding site
for TF_promoter
in the region (1,169,797 entities

tance and the Weight_Distance between those entities
(123,441 entities for promoter_transcipt and 950,514 for
enhancer_transcipt), and a last one between transcripts
and genes (53,449 entities). Each instance of classes Pro-
moter or Enhancer is associated with two sets of 808
float values, one corresponding to its expression value in
each sample, and the other corresponding to its normal-
ized relative rank in each sample compared to the 807
others. Similarly, each instance of the Transcript class is
associated with 808 float values, describing its normal-
ized relative rank in each sample compared to the others.
This rank information is directly provided by Regulatory
Circuits. Contrary to the promoters and enhancers, no
measured expression value is provided for transcripts. For
the LERC resource, the ranks were computed according
to the methodology described in [6], using the max of the
transcript promoters’ rank. Each rank identifier is built by
using the sample’s identifier (libId).

Figure 1 compiles the total number of triples and entities

in the biological data graph.

Sample-specific weights of the TF-gene regulation
networks
Each TF-gene interaction is characterized by a pro-
moter weight and by an enhancer weight. As shown
in Fig. 1, the relation between a TF and a regulatory
region is described by a confidence value, and the rank
of the regulatory region is described by a value associ-
ated with the sample. The promoter weight is defined by
(Rank_promoter_sample∗
weightP = max((confidence×
Rank_transcript_sample))2), where the maximum is
computed for all
the possible promoters mediating
is defined by
the interaction. The enhancer weight
weightE = max((confidence × Weight_Distance ×
√
(Rank_transcript_sample×Rank_enhancer_sample))2).
These formulas were generated according to the method
section of [6].

√

The SPARQL query for computing weightP is given in
Fig. 2, where SAMPLE must be replaced by the iden-
tifier of an actual sample. A similar query for comput-
ing weightE is available on the GitHub repository of the
project (cf. Availability section). The relations with a null
weight are excluded to avoid overloading the graph.

Each sample-specific network contains some values
such as ranks that depend on values from the other net-
works, so that the 808 sample-specific networks have to
be computed simultaneously. In order to save time and
CPU usage, we executed these queries once (11.2 days
CPU times) and integrated the final 808 sample-specific
networks in our resource triplestore, by using an INSERT
operation as shown in Fig. 2.

Tissue-specific weights of the TF-gene regulation networks
At the tissue level, each TF-gene interaction is charac-
terized by (i) a promoter weight (max of the promoter
weights among the samples composing the tissue), (ii) an
enhancer weight (max of the enhancer weights among
the samples composing the tissue), (iii) a Max score
combining the two previous one, and (iv) a RC score
extracted from the Regulatory circuits output data files.
We designed a SPARQL query to compute tissue-specific
promotor/enhancer weights and MAX scores and re-
inject them into the tissue-specific RDF graphs (Fig. 3).
It computes the weights of TF-Gene relations in a tissue-
specific network formed by two separate samples. The
queries for tissue-specific network with more samples (up
to 33) or a single sample are available in the GitHub
repository of the project.

Experimental context graph
The experimental context graph describes the experimen-
tal information about the 808 samples (cell types, organs,
patient clinical data [age, gender..], diseases...), about the
394 tissues (linked to the samples they are composed
of ) as well as the mappings to reference databases. Note
that the experimental data (expressions and ranks) belong
to the biological data graph. All the information con-
tained in the experimental context graph are extracted
from the nmeth_.3799-S2.xlsx file present in the
Regulatory Circuits supplementary data, and formatted to
respect the identifiers of the generated samples-specific or
tissue-specific RDF graphs.

When applicable, we also include links to other knowl-
edge bases from the Linked Open Data such as gene
identifiers from Ensembl, protein identifiers from UniPro-
tKB, cell types and anatomical structures from the Uberon
and the Foundational Model of Anatomy ontologies.

Metadata graph
The metadata graph contains all the information about
the other graphs including their VoID descriptions, as well
as the associations of the samples and tissues from the
experimental context graph with their respective graph
containing their specific regulatory network.

This explicit representation of the metadata about the
samples and the tissues can be queried by the users for
identifying the subset of samples or tissues they are inter-

ested in. The modular approach described next allows the
user to retrieve the corresponding portions of the dataset.

Structuration and computation of the modular graphs
We took advantage of the notion of named graph in the
RDF model to design a modular structure for Regulatory
Circuits that makes it possible to identify the subset of the
samples and tissues that meets the user’s requirements,
to retrieve the corresponding networks and to combine
them with additional data. To do so, we first created an
RDF named graph for general biological data such as the
binding and neighborhood relations between TFs, regula-
tory regions and genes. Second, we created a distinct RDF
named graph for each sample- and tissue-specific network
(see the INSERT clauses of the queries in Figs. 2 and 3 that
generate the weights and scores of regulation relations in
specific graphs based on information from the biological
data graph). Third, an additional metadata graph asso-
ciates each of these named graph with the corresponding
sample or tissue. Fourth, the samples and tissues’ descrip-
tions (i.e. the organs, cell types as well as patient’s char-
acteristics) as well as the composition relations of tissues
into samples are represented in the experimental context
graph. Thus, a user can query the experimental con-
text graph to identify the samples and tissues that meet
some constraints, and retrieve the associated networks.
Likewise, new samples or tissues can be combined with
Regulatory Circuits by adding the corresponding graphs
and generating the associated metadata and experimen-
tal context graphs. In both cases, the weights and scores
for the regulation relations of new dataset can be re-
computed with the queries from Figs. 2 and 3, addressing
the reusability and reproducibility requirements.

Results
Computation and integration of 808 weighted TF-gene
interactions sample-specific graphs
According to Regulatory Circuits published methodology,
the TF-gene interactions are mediated by the ability of
the TF to bind into regulatory regions of the chromatin

(enhancers or promoters), the distance of this region to
the gene (enhancer being farther and promoter being
adjacent to the genes), the region accessibility and the
gene expression. Each TF-gene interaction is therefore
characterized by a promoter weight and by an enhancer
weight (see details in Methods). From the 808 samples,
the weights were computed by adapting the method intro-
duced in [14]. The method consisted in using the biolog-
ical data graph to compute the weights with a SPARQL
query and to use the same query - with an INSERT opera-
tion - to inject the result of the query in the data graph of
the sample-specific TF-gene interaction network.

The RDF model for sample-specific TF-gene graph is
shown in Fig. 4, together with the characteristics of the
RDF graphs, their associated TF-gene interaction net-
works, and their computation times. The 808 computed
samples-specific graphs each contain between 147,129
and 982,451 relations between TF and genes, with an
average of 420,195 relations in a given sample-network.
Each relation is weighted with a promoter weight and an
enhancer weight. This resulted in 808 RDF graphs com-
posed of 1.7M triples in average - between 588K and 3.9M
in a given graph. In total, the 808 sample-specific graphs
contain 888,602,040 triples. Even if these sample-specific
networks were considered as intermediary (and unpub-
lished) results in the original Regulatory Circuits pipeline,
we advocate that they are crucial for computing tissue-
specific networks and therefore need to be accessible.

Computation and addition of 394 weighted TF-gene
interactions tissue-specific graphs
As described in the Regulatory Circuits project, each tis-
sue is associated with 1 to 33 samples. It is therefore
relevant to build TF-gene regulatory networks at the tis-
sue scale by aggregating the information provided at the
sample scale. A tissue-specific graph is the result of a
SPARQL query with a UNION pattern on the source bio-
logical data (to identify TF and genes entities) and all the
sample-specific networks (among the 808 described in the
previous paragraph) associated with the considered tissue.
As in sample-specific networks, TF-gene relations are first
characterised by (i) a promoter weight (class WeightP) and
(ii) an enhancer weight (class WeightE). They are obtained
as the maxima of the corresponding weights of the same
relation in the RDF graphs specific for all the samples
constituting the tissue.

For the sake of further studies and to follow the original
Regulatory Circuits networks, these two weights (weightP
& weightE) may need to be combined in a single score.
In this direction, the Regulatory Circuits project provided
a global score for each TF-gene interaction in a tissue,
which was integrated in our resource as the RC score.
Unfortunately, no information is available on the formula
used to compute this score. In order to gain in flexibility,

classes of entities; a relation between a TF and a gene is characterized
by (i) WeightP, the score which models the ability of the regulation to

we introduced the possibility to enrich the resource with
additional aggregating scores: for instance, we computed
the maximum of the two weights weightP and weightE,
integrated in the resource as the Max Score (see Fig. 5 for
the model of the RDF graph).

Based on the approach described in Methods section,
we computed the RDF graph of each 394 tissue-specific
TF-interaction network. As shown in Fig. 5, the RDF
graphs’ sizes were heterogeneous (from 1,8 million triples
to 14,7 Millions triples with an average of 5,6 million

triples). They could be computed in 59 minutes in aver-
age. Together, the triples of each individual tissue-specific
graph led to a resource of 2,212,260,468 triples.

From the RDF graph, we considered that a TF-gene
interaction was present in the tissue if the score aggre-
gating promoter and enhancer weights was strictly pos-
itive. According to the scores extracted from Regulatory
Circuits, each tissue interaction network has between
312,825 and 2,454,566 TF-genes interactions. This is twice
larger than the number of interactions in the networks

score of the relation given by Regulatory Circuits. At least one of these scores has a non-zero value. b Description of the content of the 394 tissue

and 1,369,313) and we have no explanation for the TF-
genes interactions that have a positive score according
to Regulatory Circuits, even though the corresponding
scores in all the associated samples are zero.

All the TF-genes interactions, with their weights and
scores, computed or from the original networks are stored
in their respective tissue-specific named graphs and are
available for querying following the SPARQL patterns
available on GitHub.

Modular organization of all the resources associated with
regulatory circuits: the LERC dataset
As seen previously, the initial RC dataset [14] can be
associated simultaneously to (i) an RDF experimental con-
text graph (see Methods section), (ii) 808 sample-specific
RDF graphs, and (iii) 394 tissue-specific RDF graphs. In
order to allow for a transversal exploration and to avoid
performance issues when integrating and querying large
datasets, we integrated all these resources in a single
RDF dataset. This dataset is organized according to a
modular architecture based on named graphs and shown
in Fig. 6. The different layers of the modular organiza-
tion are linked by an RDF metadata graph, which con-
tains all the information about the other graphs includ-
ing their VoID descriptions and characteristics about
the graphs (number of triples, entities, etc.), as well as
the associations of the samples and tissues with their
respective graph. The RDF model is supported by the
regulatorycircuits.owl ontology provided on the
GitHub repository (cf. Availability section).

Overall, the LERC dataset encompasses a total of 1,205
graphs of five types: 1 source biological data graph (in
blue), 1 experimental context graph (in purple), 808
sample-specific graphs (in green), 394 tissue-specific
graphs (in orange) and 1 metadata graph (in grey). Their
main characteristics are as follows:

• The source biologicaldatagraph representing the
biological data of the RegulatoryCircuits and
FANTOM5 projects was already published in [14]
(see Fig. 1).

• The experimentalcontextgraph contains all the

information about samples and tissues. As shown in
Fig. 7, it describes the experimental information
about the 808 samples (cell types, organs, patient,
diseases...) and mappings to reference databases such
as Uberon) and the 394 tissues (links to the samples
they are composed of).

• Each sample-specificgraph provides the weights of

the TF-gene interactions associated with the
considered sample (See Fig. 4).

• Each tissue-specificgraph provides the weights and

scores of the TF-gene interactions associated with the

considered tissue-specific regulatory networks, which
is an aggregation of biologically related individual
samples (See Fig. 5).

• The metadatagraph contains all the information
about the other graphs including their VoID
descriptions, number of triples and entities.

The LERC resource is composed of 3,910,794,050 triples
and the distribution of the triples by graphs can be seen in
Fig. 6. In total it required 28.6 days CPU on a 32GB RAM
virtual machine with 4 VCPU to generate the RDF dataset
from the initial integration of the biological data graph
to the computation of the tissue-specific graphs. Overall,
118 anatomical tissues and 55 cell types were automati-
cally mapped to 165 anatomical structures from the FMA
and 157 from Uberon. 112 regulatory circuits were man-
ually mapped to 79 diseases from the Human Disease
ontology.

Biologically-relevant queries
Exploring LERC can be done at several levels. We intro-
duce fifteen examples SPARQL queries that can be used
to navigate LERC. These pre-built queries are available on
the GitHub of the project. They can be used as such or
adapted to compose more elaborate queries.

• On the biological data graph, the query

find_tf.rq allows to retrieve the different entities:
TFs, genes or regions.

• Using the experimental context graph, the query
tissues_samples.rq allows to extract the
samples corresponding to a tissue or to all the tissues.
• The query extract_network.rq extracts all the
TF-genes relations of a tissue (or sample) and its
associated scores or weights, using its associated RDF
graph.

• Using two different sample-specific graphs (or tissue),
the query compute_network_2samples.rq
enables to extract the union of the scored relations
TF-genes for two samples (or tissues).

• On a sample or tissue named graph, the query

find_targets.rq enables to find the targets of a
specific TF in this sample (or tissue).

• Using two sample or tissue-specific RDF graphs, the
query compare_targets.rq compares the
targeted genes of a specific TF across two different
tissues. It gives the union of the TF-genes relations
and allows to compare their scores in the two tissues .

• The query compare_regulator.rq finds the

different weights of the common regulators of a set of
genes in two given tissues using two named graphs
(tissue or sample specific).

• The query get_tissues_info.rq retrieves the
samples composing a tissue, the biological tissue, age

entities. Grey boxes represent mappings to external resources

of the patients and other experimental information,
using the experimental context graph.

• The query Limit_exp_conditions.rq limits
the experimental conditions by retrieving the names
of the samples composing a tissue that follow some
restrictions: for example selecting only the samples
from patients who are over 55 years old.

• The query Limit_to_healthCondition.rq
lists all the samples composing one biological tissue
with a disease or an health condition (non specific)
associated and the name of the condition.

• The query Limit_to_healthy_samples.rq

lists all the samples composing one tissue that are not
linked to any disease.

• The query Samples_specific_disease.rq
lists all the samples that are linked to a specific
disease or diseases containing one word.

• The queries

query-samplesInAnatomicalLocation.rq,
query-samplesInCellType.rq and
query-samplesInDisease.rq are federated
queries that leverage the mappings to Uberon, the
Cell Ontology and to the Human Disease ontology to
retrieve the samples that match criteria requiring
some ontology-based reasoning.

The Limit_exp_conditions.rq query illustrates
the added-value of LERC in terms of flexibility to tailor
analyses according to the needs of the user. For exam-

ple, let us consider the tissue-specific TF-gene interac-
tion graph “CD14+ Monocytes” which contains 2,402,498
scored TF-genes relations in LERC. However, we notice
that the tissue is composed of 33 samples. Among these
samples, only 3 were measured in blood (for the others,
the biological origin is unknown), in men aged 47, 57
and 53 (result of the query get_tissues_info.rq).
If the user is specifically interested in CD14+ Mono-
the experi-
cytes from blood for patient over 55,
mental context graph can be queried with the query
Limit_exp_conditions.rq. The query returns a
unique sample respecting the conditions. The user can
then use the query extract_network.rq with this
sample. The resulting TF-gene interaction graph contains
846,930 interactions, pointing out the putative specific
effect of genes on this tissue and patient category. We
notice that such a tailored result is obtained with a very
short SPARQL query (Fig. 8) which can be easily adapted
to the user’s needs.

If the user wants to add to LERC the result of this
new network computed with specific conditions, it can be
done by using one of the injection queries (see Methods
section and Fig. 2) replacing the samples’ names by the
ones respecting the conditions and naming the resulting
graph with a new specific name. Naturally, this should be
performed on the user’s local copy of the dataset.

For the sake of further studies and to follow the original
Regulatory Circuits networks, these two weights (weightP
& weightE) may need to be combined in a single score.

Discussion
In this article, we address the issue of making the bio-
logical datasets from the Regulatory Circuits project [6]
reusable. We exposed the intermediate results such as the
sample-specific regulation networks so that biologists can
now access the information they need. This adds both the
capacity to reuse portions of the pipeline’s results in other
studies, and the capacity to enrich the data with additional
information.

According to the Findability, Accessibility, Interoper-
ability, and Reuse (FAIR) guidelines [18], the construction
of the LERC resource to represent and extend the Reg-
ulatory Circuits project as an RDF dataset follows the
best practices, using reification for weighted relations, and
using named graphs to link the RDF graphs created for
each different dataset handled in the regulatory circuits
project. It also provides mappings to reference databases
such as UniProtKB, Ensembl, Uberon, the Foundational
Model of Anatomy ontology (FMA) and the Human
Disease Ontology and follows the faldo chromosomal
localization format. Federated SPARQL queries can then
be used to combine information for Regulatory Circuits
with information from these resources (e.g. associations
with diseases, cell types or anatomical location. Examples
illustrating federated queries and ontology-based reason-
ing are provided in the Github respository). The LERC
resource is available on a persistent domain and all queries
are publicly available on GitHub.

By both converting and enriching the Regulatory
Circuits dataset into RDF with our modular principles,
and by allowing flexible SPARQL queries on the LERC
resource, our contribution to reusability is threefold.
First, it facilitates the reuse of Regulatory Circuits results
in other studies by providing access to the tissue-specific
regulatory networks and the associated information.
Second, it facilitates the reuse of the studies’ data in
other pipelines by providing access to the samples’ exper-
imental context and to the intermediary results such
as the sample-specific regulatory networks, which can

be reused to compute other indicators than Regulatory
Circuits published weights and scores. Third, it provides
the capacity to enrich the Regulatory Circuits dataset with
additional information as the data model and Semantic
Web technologies support adding new samples or defin-
ing new tissues, and the SPARQL queries we provide can
generate the corresponding weights and scores. Overall,
the Regulatory Circuits case study confirms that Semantic
Web technologies are a relevant solution for reusing
knowledge bases [12, 19], and demonstrates that they
are also applicable to address the challenge of integrating
them to project-specific datasets [20].

Improving the exploration of Regulatory Circuits’s
biological data and networks In a previous work [14]
we showed that the Regulatory Circuits workflow can be
described using Semantic Web technologies thus increas-
ing its reproducibility. This new implementation, includ-
ing not only the input data but also the TF-gene inter-
action networks resulting from the in-silico integration
of source biological data, allows a more flexible (re)use
of Regulatory Circuits. The implementation we propose
allows a fine-grained exploration: the user can select por-
tions of the network, for example excluding regions at a
lower distance than the Regulatory Circuits threshold, or
excluding one type of region (e.g. for taking into account
that promoters relations are more reliable).

Improving the reusability and the enrichment of the
source biological data with SPARQL queries The net-
works available in the Regulatory Circuits website are
static and cannot be updated when the biological datasets
it was based upon evolve. A major advantage of our
approach is that TF-gene interaction networks for sam-
ples and tissues are generated with SPARQL queries from
the source biological data before being inserted in the
resource. In addition, this implementation also allows the
user to easily change some parts of the pipeline that gen-
erates the network, such as new calculation of the ranks,

Louarn et al. Journal of Biomedical Semantics           (2022) 13:11 

Page 14 of 15

to add new genes or transcription factors in the networks,
or to remove some of them. All these changes can easily be
implemented by adapting the few available queries used
to generate the network but necessitate to re-compute the
new networks.

Our resource and the approach we use to populate it
also facilitates the generation of new TF-gene interac-
tion networks for new tissues, through the aggregation
of samples with characteristics different from those cho-
sen in the Regulatory Circuits project. Regulatory Circuits
presents 394 tissue-specific networks, but looking into the
detail of the samples and tissues revealed that some tis-
sues could be separated into smaller sets. For example,
the “CD14+ Monocytes” network given in Regulatory Cir-
cuits is based on 33 CD14+ monocytes cell samples, which
have different characteristics (origin, donor age...). The
modular structure of our resource allows for the compu-
tation of new TF-gene interaction network using these
characteristics to better discriminate the samples.

Finally, using the LERC introduced in this article and
the strategy used to build it allows the user to add new
tissues or TFs if they have similar input data. This would
require to pre-compute rankings for transcripts and reg-
ulatory regions which are at the moment provided by the
Regulatory Circuits resource and cannot be recomputed.
Similarly, introducing a new TFs would require to intro-
duce new confidence values for their binding to regulatory
regions.

Improving interoperability Among the 217 articles cit-
ing Regulatory Circuits, at least 42 either use directly the
resulting networks for biological data explanation or use
them as comparison for regulatory network inference. In
10 of these, Regulatory Circuits was used in combination
with one or several other databases. Other resources on
TF-genes relations exist [21, 22] but are complementary
of Regulatory Circuits, the latter being the only one cat-
egorizing tissue-specific networks. By representing Reg-
ulatory Circuits as an RDF graph we therefore improve
its interoperability with resources of similar scope already
based on Semantic Web technologies, which facilitates
its reuse in combination with other already existing RDF
resources. In particular, it significantly extends the por-
tion of FANTOM5 data available as RDF [23, 24].

Conclusion
We present a generic approach for the enrichment of
source biological data with the result of data analyses. Our
results show that a Semantic Web approach scales not
only for the integration of large-scale biological data but
also for the iterative enrichment of such a resource with
the results of in-silico analyses modeled with SPARQL
queries. This is possible by using a modular structure
based on RDF named graphs. This strategy could be eas-

ily transposed to other large scale life science studies
which analysis pipeline describes relations with simple
arithmetic functions.
